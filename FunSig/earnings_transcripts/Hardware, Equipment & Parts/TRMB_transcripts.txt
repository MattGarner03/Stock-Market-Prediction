===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-07 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to Trimble First Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, President and CEO. Rob, you may begin.
Rob Painter: Welcome everyone. Before I get started, our presentation and Safe Harbor Statement are available on our website. Our financial review will focus on year-over-year non-GAAP performance metrics on an organic basis. In addition, we will focus on adjusted numbers that we believe more accurately portray the underlying performance of our business. This means we will exclude divested agriculture and mobility businesses. We also adjust for the approximately $50 million of January 1st term license revenue that was recognized in the first quarter of 2024 but not in the first quarter of 2025 because January 1st, 2025, fell into the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. We exited 2024 on a strong footing, strategically, operationally and financially. The results of the first quarter of 2025 are further evidence of the strength of our business. To understand how we are positioned to navigate the uncertainty at the moment is to understand the quality of our performance in the first quarter, which can be expressed in three words; clarity, durability, and momentum. Clarity manifests as the simplification and focus we have brought to our business over the last few years. On February 8th, we closed the sale of our Transportation Mobility business to Platform Science, further solidifying our strategic focus to compete and invest where we have a natural right to win. Starting with Slide 4, durability manifests through the quality of our business model, which we intentionally transformed over the last few years. Today, we are three quarter software, two-thirds ARR asset-light and operating with a strong balance sheet. We are in the business of selling productivity and efficiency outcomes to our customers, and our technologies are mission-critical. While visibility and predictability into the future is far from perfect, it is definitively higher and better than at any point in our 47-year history. In the first quarter, as detailed on Slide 5, momentum manifested in a beat across the board. Revenue at $841 million was up 3% organically and up 10% after adjusting for the timing of January 1. ARR at $2.11 billion was up 17% organically and was ahead of expectations across our segments. EPS at $0.61 was also ahead of expectations. Congratulations to our team and our partners. Despite the strong start to the year and our current momentum, we are maintaining our guidance for the year as we feel the prudent move is to inject a degree of conservatism into our outlook. Tariffs are modest in our software-centric business and have thus far been offset with pricing. We will all know more in three months, and we will recalibrate at that point. One area of Trimble where we are not cautious is in our AI journey, where we are moving with a clarity of purpose to better serve our customers while further strengthening our own business operations. We're not just talking, we are acting. In April, we held a virtual internal AI summit with nearly 2,500 internal attendees, where we spent a day reviewing priorities and work in progress. In addition, we have OKRs throughout the company to drive execution and accountability to AI outcomes. Slide 6 provides a framework for how we think about internal and external applications of AI on one axis and delivery of cost efficiencies and revenue growth on the other axis. This framing helps us allocate capital with intention. For example, our product managers are leveraging AI to develop marketing and technical requirements documentation. Our marketers are beginning to generate sales pipeline with agents mining data from our CRM systems. Our sellers are leveraging AI for sales coaching. Our customer success teams are leveraging AI for case deflection and our software engineers are programming and testing with AI productivity tools. We are also releasing AI capabilities into our customer-facing solutions, from natural language prompted design to feature extraction out of 3D point clouds to automating invoices and even releasing stand-alone automation products to connect to carriers and shippers. We believe we have a natural right to win and an AI forward emphatically so given the unique scope and scale of Trimble in the physical and digital world. With that in mind, let's step back and share our view on the macros. And for words, opportunity, coupled with uncertainty. On an absolute basis, the uncertainty of tariffs and trade policy put sand in the gears and stoke fears of an economic downturn. Despite these fears, the business is resilient, and we outperformed in the quarter. On a relative basis, we look at how our business is competitively positioned. In this respect, if we hit a downturn, we believe we can outperform and win market share. Weak competitors will reduce investment or exit the market, and we have the ability to run cross-sell and upsell plays if new logo generation becomes more difficult. At our Investor Day in December, we talked about $1.4 billion of cross-sell opportunities in the portfolio. We also have the balance sheet to continue to take subscription models to market in our software and hardware offerings, thus delivering more affordable access to our technology. In summary, this leadership team has successfully managed through challenging environments by applying a simple and consistent principle, position ourselves to exit periods of challenge on a stronger competitive footing. Year-to-date, the opportunities have outweighed the uncertainties. Across end markets and geographies, we see pockets of strength at the same time we see pockets of modest weakness. In the last few weeks, I have met inverse with dozens of global customers and partners in seven countries. Most of them were level-headed and taking a wait-and-see approach. We have seen modest softness in the public sector in the U.S. and slightly longer sales cycles with enterprise customers. On the other hand, Germany's announcement of infrastructure spend has been a positive. We see global strength in customer segments such as small to midsized construction companies and in industry segments such as data centers, renewables and mining. With that context, let's talk about each of our segments, starting with AECO and a quote from an engineering customer who said the following, with all these technologies connecting together with AI and internet of things, having all your solutions under one platform just makes sense. This sentiment is indicative of the success we are having with Trimble Construction One and our cross-selling efforts. In the quarter, ARR outperformed, up 19% to a record $1.29 billion. ACV bookings remained strong, growing in the mid-teens. Indicators we pay special attention to include ACV bookings, pipeline, net retention and the lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio. All these indicators are healthy at the moment. In the last weeks, we have launched the 2025 versions of our bema engineering and architecture and design solutions both of which are bringing new AI features to market. Moving to Field Systems. I'll start with the quote from a customer talking about the value proposition of our machine control and Guidance-as-a-Service offering. The Trimble offering allows me to sleep better at night with the subscription, budgeting equipment costs on bids is easier, and it makes us more competitive. I don't have to worry about outdated software or communication between systems or that the technology we just spent thousands of dollars on is now obsolete. That's a subscription advantage that is irreplaceable. The business outperformed in the quarter with particular strength in civil construction and advanced positioning. The subscription offering in the quote contributed to 25% ARR growth in the segment to a record $358 million. An interesting and important fact is that 50% of our customers who bought machine control as a service in the quarter were new logos once again affirming that smart business model transformations expand addressable markets. In early April, our field systems team was at the bauma Trade Show in Munich, where our technology was present on more than 20 OEM boots, signifying the importance of Trimble in the ecosystem and demonstrating our commitment to serve the mixed fleet. Moving to Transportation. I'll start by quoting a long-time customer who said, "We are impressed by the high quality of work and expertise that Trimble brings to a digitalization." This quote is indicative of the fundamental transformation happening in our served industries, which transcends economic cycles, thus providing context for continued growth in an underlying freight recession. ARR and transportation grew 7% to a record $459 million. The split of revenue in this business is 40%; Europe, Middle East and Africa, 57% North America, and 3% rest of world, and our systems are mission-critical, which we believe provide a downside ballast of China, U.S. trade further deteriorates. With respect to KPIs in the segment, they are the same ones we think about in AECO, including ACV bookings, which exceeded our expectations in the quarter in which we expect to grow double-digits this year. For market health, we look at tender rejection rates along with spot pricing for more real-time market conditions and both are relatively steady. In the Transporeon business, we can also see pretty clear industry segment trends. For example, in Europe, we can confirm what appears to be somewhat self-evident. The automotive segment is down while retail and construction materials are up. In summary, clarity, durability and momentum in the form of a strong start to the year gives us confidence and conviction to stay the course. Phil, over to you.
Phil Sawarynski: Thanks Rob. A few items to cover before turning to the slides. On April 25th, we filed our 2024 10-K no changes to the financials that we presented earlier this year. In addition, we recently announced a change in our auditors for the 2025 fiscal year. We're excited to welcome KPMG as our new auditor. We thank E&Y for their service, and I want to offer a particularly large thank you to the Trimble team for all the hard work and dedication throughout and we are looking forward to a successful transition. Turning to our operations, let's start with tariffs as they stand today. The total impact adds approximately $10 million per quarter to our cost of goods in the field Systems segment. We've already implemented surcharges to offset this, Thus, we expect no impact to profitability. We are managing discretionary spend and directing capital to the most attractive market opportunities such as data centers and infrastructure while continuing to invest in the transformation and growth of our core business. We bought back $627 million of shares in the first quarter and have the remaining $373 million of authorization available. We continue to believe that repurchasing Trimble stock is an attractive opportunity for capital deployment given our share price today. With respect to M&A, we are primarily focused on small tuck-ins with opportunities for fast integration where we can quickly cross-sell and upsell our customer base, yielding a rapid return on investment without deploying significant capital. Let's review the first quarter of 2025, starting on Slide 7. As we noted previously, we have approximately $50 million of term license renewals that are recognized on January 1st. These happened in the first and fourth quarters of 2024, but not in the first quarter of 2025. The right way to look at the business progression is to normalize for this dynamic. Unless otherwise noted, I will be talking about our as-adjusted numbers, which remove the effects of the recent divestitures, which we further adjust for the January 1 term license renewals. As-reported numbers, along with the reconciliation are provided in the appendix. Organic revenue was up 10% and ARR was strong, up 17% to a record $2.11 billion. Gross margins expanded 180 basis points to 69.9%, and which shows our continued model progression despite the greater hardware mix with the field systems performance. We achieved EBITDA margins of 25.9%, which is a 100 basis points expansion year-over-year. Reporting earnings per share was $0.61 for the quarter. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items on Slide 8. Our reported free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, which represents a conversion rate of 1 times net income. Our balance sheet is strong with $290 million of cash and a leverage ratio of less than 1.3 times, which is well below our long-term target rate of 2.5 times from a liquidity standpoint, we are asset and working capital life and have the full $1.25 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Let's shift to a segment review of the numbers before we close with guidance, starting with AECO on Slide 9. AECO delivered a record $1.29 billion of ARR, posting 19% ARR growth for the quarter. operating income at 27.3% increased 50 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect the segment to expand margins by about 100 basis points for the full year. The business continues to operate well above the rule of 40 and was greater than the Rule of 45 in the first quarter. Next, Field Systems on Slide 10. The Revenue was up 6% and ARR growth up 25% for the quarter, where we continue to successfully execute our business model conversions. Our civil construction business was particularly strong, and ARR was driven by positioning services and sales of subscription offerings. Overall, dealer inventories went down for the quarter for our businesses and are sized appropriately for the demand, taking into account the uncertainty in the market. Operating income at 29.7% increased 280 basis points, driven by the increasing higher-margin recurring mix. Finally, Transportation and Logistics on Slide 11. Revenue and ARR were up 6% and 7%, respectively, for the quarter. The segment is now greater than 90% recurring revenue following the divestiture of the mobility business. We made good progress bringing the global transportation teams together in the first quarter as we execute our connected scale strategy, which allows us to access the $400 million of cross-sell, upsell opportunities within this segment. Operating margins of 21.2% are expected to improve in the next three quarters as we continue to execute the strategy. Let me turn to guidance on Slide 12. We are maintaining our full year as-reported 2025 guidance with the midpoint at $3.42 billion of revenue and $2.87 of earnings per share. We're also maintaining our organic ARR growth as-adjusted guidance midpoint of 14%. With the macro uncertainty Rob mentioned, we are de-risking our guidance by modestly reducing our organic revenue growth, driven mostly by non-ARR revenue in field systems and to a lesser extent, transportation. This is offset by the revenue benefits we see with the change in foreign currency exchange rates, along with the first quarter outperformance. We will revisit our guidance with second quarter results, and we expect to have greater clarity. Looking at the calendarization, the fourth quarter of 2025 benefits from January 1st in the quarter, which is expected to bring approximately $60 million of high-margin term license revenue. We provided an updated view of this calendarization in the earnings supplement on our Investor site. On an as-adjusted basis, our EPS guide implies low to mid-teens EPS growth year-over-year, which is consistent with our long-term model. From a cash flow perspective, our full year view is updated to be 0.9 times net income after adjusting for the $253 million cash tax payment for gain on sale of the Ag JV and approximately $35 million in M&A costs. Relative to the prior guide, we are expecting higher cash taxes and one-time items. We continue to expect that we can deliver free cash flow greater than non-GAAP net income over the long-term. For the second quarter guidance on Slide 14, we expect as-reported revenue to be in the $815 million to $845 million range and EPS of $0.59 to $0.65 and which is consistent with the numbers we provided earlier in the year. We expect organic growth in the second quarter to be in the 2% to 6% range. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob.
Rob Painter: Durability in our business. This happened by design, not by accident. We are positioned to withstand market headwinds. Momentum. We saw ROI on mission-critical applications. Our Connected Scale strategy works, and we will continue to prosecute our strategy. Clarity of purpose. We have always managed with a mindset to exit challenging times on a stronger competitive basis than when we entered it. Control what we can control, embrace our values, follow the money, control our costs execute our OKRs, lead. Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Kristen, please go ahead.
Kristen Owen: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a nice start to the year. So, Rob, I wanted to double-click on the field systems business. When I look at the results of some of your large peers, it almost seems like night and day. in terms of your relative performance and resilience even against sort of the broader macro uncertainty. So, I'm wondering if you can walk us through what's working there? And if there are any shifts you're seeing in the competitive environment? And then I'm going to ask my follow-up now because they're somewhat related. You've restructured the CAT JV and since then, you've announced a number of these new OEM and distribution partners on the civil construction side. So, I'm just hoping you can contextualize those partnerships for us help us understand go-to-market strategy and how to think about that growth contribution to the portfolio over time? I know it's a lot here.
Rob Painter: Hey Kristen, thanks for the questions and good morning. I'll start with the addressable market view at that level. The market is large, global, underserved and underpenetrated. Customer lens, they demand solutions to serve mixed fleets. So, we start there. Then within the portfolio, what's working, I look at the intersection of product and channel. And I think we have the best performing product in the market and the best global dealer channel in the world at a product level, it's double-click there. For example, look at site works, and our site works line guidance supports the mid-tier machines. At bauma, we announced support for Tilt buckets on excavators, which is a need for Europe. So we continue to progress on the product side to perform and to meet the opportunities out there in the market. For example, excavators are the largest machine count in the world, so the better we can serve and penetrate that market, the more we can grow our business. I talked about the business model a little bit in the prepared remarks that subscription offering. We see that expanding the addressable market. That's something uniquely we can do. We look at workflow there, think about linking what we're doing to link our B2W track product so that to what we're doing out in the field and machine control so that we can connect production and compare it to plan and then create action out of that. That's moving from the product or the solution up to the workflow. And then I'd be remiss not to congratulate the team. Ron and Scott, and the team have just a really consistent leadership and strategy and deserve a lot of credit for driving the business forward. Really proud of the results that this team and our partners delivered and have been delivering. You asked about go-to-market and where we are on that. Well, the basis of our go-to market, of course, is the SCITEC channel, and it will continue to be so into the future. At an OEM level, we renewed our cat relationship last year, as you know, and a big congrats to gen and Joe in that transition, they've just gone at the CEO level. And in the fall, we announced a relationship with John Deere and working with their smart grid line of guidance and technology. At bauma, we announced a Leber relationship partnership for their factory ready dozers. And in fact, at bauma, we had technology on over 20 different boots. And then finally, we have established -- and are establishing a set of technology outlets, four of which have already been signed up in these technology outlets are meant to expand the reach for OEMs that we're working with, with a vision in mind to increase the adoption and penetration of the technology in the market. So, the pieces are really working well together now. and very happy with the results of the business and proud of the team for delivering these results.
Kristen Owen: Thank you for that color. I'll leave it there.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Devin Au: Good morning Rob, good morning Phil. This is actually Devin on for Jason Celino this morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask about kind of what you're hearing from customers within AECO among construction owners and engineers? How are you thinking about their business and near-term project outlook -- have you seen any noticeable increase in both the scrutiny or cell cycle elongating in the month of April? And have those trends kind of continued into May? Just any color there would be helpful.
Rob Painter: Hi, good morning. This is Rob. I'll take the question. Overall, in AECO, it's steady as she goes. The performance in the first quarter speaks for itself, the 19% growth in ARR and ACV bookings in the high teens. What we've seen into the quarter in the last few weeks is consistent in support to the guide we have and whether you want to call that for the second quarter or for the rest of the year. At any time, there are, for sure, pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. And I would say that's true and really in any market. So, for sure, the market is dynamic and there's a bit of heightened uncertainty. We've seen a little longer sales cycles from the largest customers we have, I kind of call it that enterprise level of customer. They're not -- we haven't seen companies changing decisions. We've seen them take longer to make decisions. But nothing that fundamentally moves the needle on our business when I say that. On the flip side of that, we continue to see pockets of strength, whether it's data centers, renewables, you go over to Europe and you've got a different dynamic than what you have in the U.S. and with Germany announcing a potential trillion infrastructure build that's put some wind in the sales of confidence out there in the market. So, a little bit of -- I'd see some signals on both sides of it, but that's positive, and we see opportunity through that uncertainty. And what we've seen quarter-to-date supports the outlook we have for the quarter and for the year.
Devin Au: That's really helpful context. And then just a quick follow-up. I know you've called out a really healthy metrics that you're seeing across the business. Organic ARR growth accelerated by 1 point in the quarter. Have you seen any maybe deals that might have gone pulled forward just because of the geopolitical challenges and concerns? But any dealers may have shifted more math other than have drove the strength in the quarter? Thanks.
Rob Painter: Yes, it's a great question. I would separate software business from a hardware business on that. There's such a thing as a pull forward on a software sale, I'll take it all day long, but I don't actually think that, that happened because we haven't changed pricing in software would make that happen. So, it's really more of a relevant question on the hardware business, which is less than 25% of the revenue we have in the company now. we think that there may have been a few million, like maybe less than $5 million of pull forward in the quarter. At the same time, though, it's a really important metric we look at is our dealer inventories, and they went down in the quarter. So, the retail sales, therefore, outpaced even the wholesale sales. that we had to our channel. And just to make sure that clarifying that we sell our hardware predominantly through the dealer channels today and the software that we sell direct.
Devin Au: Thank you so much for the color and for taking my questions.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Tami, please go ahead.
Tami Zakaria: Hey good morning to Team Trimble and congrats on the strong start to the year. My first question is on the $10 million tariff impact I'm assuming you're taking pricing to offset that. Is that $10 million coming from mainly China? I'm basically trying to understand what the $10 million impact per quarter could look like if China tariffs come down from the current 145% rate? Or are there other countries in that $10 million?
Phil Sawarynski: Hey Tami, it's Phil. Thanks for the question. So, the $10 million is really the product that comes into the U.S. and it's mainly more of the Canada and Mexico products that aren't USMCA compliant. Most of the China products, we get are very cables and batteries and low lower dollar items that we pass through some of that pricing there, but it's not a big portion of our COGS, the main items that are driving that $10 million are coming from Canada and Mexico into the U.S. that are in USMCA-compliant?
Tami Zakaria: Understood. That's clear. Thank you so much. And then my other question is -- can you remind us what revenue exposure you have to federal sources and whether we should expect any impact from any dose-related cost cuts in the coming quarters?
Phil Sawarynski: Yes, we weren't very bullish on the government business coming into the year. And so it was actually a very small amount in our original guide. We've actually removed a little bit more in the current guide as well. So, our exposure is very small for the rest of the year in the, call it, single-digit millions. So, if there's any further cost will be a material impact.
Tami Zakaria: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Jonathan, please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to understand a little bit better your comments around AI. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the potential here for customers to maybe reevaluate the solutions and how maybe this benefit simple from the competitive stance?
Rob Painter: Hey Jonathan, good morning. It's Rob, I'll take the question. from a competitive stance and a strategy view, the thing that is so unique about Trimble is the scope and scale of the data that we see across the industry life cycle continues, whether that's in transportation, connecting the carriers and shippers over that plan procure execute lifecycle or it's construction, connecting the architects engineers, contractors and owners across the life cycle for plan design to build to operate. So, that scope and scale is unique, and we talk about it in forms of trillions, millions, millions and thousands. We manage over $1 trillion of construction through Trimble. We manage tens of billings of trade through Trimble, we have millions of users of our software around the world and hundreds of thousands of instruments in the machines in the real-world use and operate on Trimble technology. So, there's something that's really unique with respect to the corpus of data that we have. And we see customers increasingly talking about -- they may not use the exact words, but talking about moving from task optimization to systems optimization, solving higher order problems, thinking about workflow and ecosystems, not just tasks or products. So, in an AI sense, I think this is a great setup for our company and the value that we can provide to our customers and increasingly in the customer conversations I have. They start and end by talking about data and how can they unlock more of their data and get more insights out of it. How do they operate in common and connected data environment to link Trimble and non-Trimble data together so that they can achieve the productivity, quality, safety, transparency, and sustainability they need out of their work? So, with that all as a backdrop, I'm really bullish about the work that our teams are doing in the AI realm. And there's a whole aspect of what we're doing internally. You're asking more of an external customer-facing question. And so we already are delivering capabilities that are AI-driven capabilities to our customers, whether it's natural language based design to AI-based rendering and then design packages, whether it's feature extraction out of 3D point cloud and geospatial context or automating the connection between procurement and quotation between shippers and carriers. So, there's -- to me, I just really pleased with the work that the team is doing, and we are still so early in our journey. So, I think it's a great setup here for the path ahead of us.
Jonathan Ho: That makes a ton of sense. Can you also give us a bit more detail on the machine control as a service and how much of new businesses may be coming in through this? Are there any potentials to flip existing hardware customers? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Yes. On that one, what we saw in the quarter is really interesting. And actually, it's not just the quarter, we've seen us over the last few years we've been doing this. The business does continue to grow. So the team had a record level of bookings that we call Works Plus is the offering. And the new logos that we won -- or excuse me, the customers that we won in the quarter, 50% of them, more in fact, more than 50% were new logos. That's super interesting and compelling to me. To me, that's demonstrable evidence that the business model can expand the size of the addressable market. And we've seen that in every single software product where we've made these transitions, as we've seen the unit counts go up as it becomes more accessible. What's also interesting and it links to the back half of your question, is that we've seen it be used to in competitive swap-outs. I mean there's really -- I see an increasing level of competitive competitors that we are able to swap out and this business model contributes to -- I mean, the overall strategy does as well. The business model makes it more affordable for the customers to make these fleet swaps to move to Trimble. So, and then what you should expect to see and hear from us over time is with that basis of the subscription offering, think about the land and expand plays to be able to deliver more value in the form of additional software and workflow that we can put on top of that base.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Rob, please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks and good morning. I had a couple of questions just on digging in a little bit to the stickiness of the software business. And I guess the first would be just that we're now a few quarters into slowdown, inflection decline in interest rate sensitive construction. I'm wondering if you've seen any material change in churn among your kind of your smaller and contractor costs, are smaller end customers of whatever restored in software construction? And then secondly, Rob, I think you touched on your scale and your ability to sort of gain share in downturns. I'm wondering if you had any expanded comments on what you were thinking might struggle in the software ecosystem, if it's the downturn comes at the moment for things to flock to the bigger platforms? Maybe just talk about what you're thinking about there, and I'll stop. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Hey Rob, thanks for the question. On the stickiness of the software, I think the best place I can start would be comment where the net retention over a trailing 12-month basis is held steady at about 110%. That's already a great number in and of itself and it's holding steady. So, that's the best evidence I can give in terms of gross retention and continuing to upsell and cross-sell in the portfolio. You asked about smaller customers and churn. Actually, we've seen more growth in the smaller customer base in the small and midsized customer base in the construction realm anyway, because that we see as a very untapped market. So actually quite bullish about the ability to increase the level of penetration in that market. At the same time, I understand it's logical that to think about the balance sheet of smaller players in the world compared to the larger ones. One thing that's a ballast, I think, for the whole industry is there's significant backlog overall. Now, as you know, that's differential depending on which state or which part of the world you're in, what end markets you focus on, I'm taking a broad paint brush to say that there's a healthy amount of backlog. So it's not the first thing we think about is liquidity, balance sheet liquidity of our smaller customers. So they're doing well, and we see actually quite a lot of growth there. You asked about gaining share in a downturn and to put a little more color on that. So hey, the construction ecosystem, technology ecosystem is a vibrant ecosystem. There's a lot of really interesting companies out there. We have a venture capital arm where we've invested in a few companies. I think if you step back and look at that ecosystem, like most start-ups, most won't make it. That's the nature of the game. Those that do, I think many of them have turned out to be features as opposed to businesses that to get to that, there's one thing to get to the first one, let's say, $5 million of revenue. What tends to gate to a lot of those companies is go-to-market from getting to $10 million or getting to the $100 million of ARR. And that's when you find in many cases, they really act more as features on a bigger platform, as opposed to stand-alone products. We've done a few tuck-ins ourselves in the last couple of years in AECO and in each case, what we've seen is when we put capability into our go-to-market arm, whether that's in field HR capabilities or in payments as two examples. We've significantly accelerated the size of those businesses by plugging it into our go-to-market engine. So, I would posit that in a tougher economic environment. It's going to be harder for the smaller companies to raise money and to have the balance sheet to withstand storms if they come. And maybe they won't come. But if they come, I think we're in a position to do quite well and to gain share in a downturn.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Chad, please go ahead.
Chad Dillard: Hey, good morning guys. So, what are you messaging to distributors about the tariff-driven pricing actions? How much are you raising price when does this hit? Is it search are? Is it a formal price raised? And then for the $10 million that you called out, is that do you expect to pass that entirely on? Or is there some sharing between yourself, the distributor of the customer? I'm just trying to think through that.
Rob Painter: Hey Chad, good morning and thanks for the question. It's Rob. That's a pretty easy answer. It's North America only. It's a surcharge. The surcharge level is 4%. So put 4% in context of what we might normally see as pricing in a given year. That is, let's say, doable and we've seen the market move to that price. So, it's actually quite straightforward.
Chad Dillard: Okay, simple enough. And then just on Transporeon, can you just give a little bit of color on what you saw in the market and how you're thinking about that business for the balance of the year?
Rob Painter: Yes. Good question. So, in that business, I'd say, financial performance level, the business grew high single-digit on a year-over-year basis. When we look forward to the rest forward into 2025, we still believe we've got the pipeline to drive double-digit growth in the bookings of the business on a year-over-year basis, the profitability of the business increased. Increasingly, we're not looking at it as just Transporeon, we look at it in the context of the overall segment. So, probably over time, we'll talk less and less about Transporeon on its own, and that is because we're connecting more of the Transporeon products, whether that's visibility or marketplace capabilities and with our TMS or Transportation Management System capabilities that we have been doing more things together. The organization is moving -- has mostly moved actually already to a functional organization. So as we go to market, we can take the full set of capabilities in a more coherent way to market. And then I guess the other thing I can add, Chad, is within Transporeon we get an interesting view in the world of -- from the shippers and what volume of goods that they're moving. And so in the prepared remarks, when I mentioned that we can see automotive units down, that's because there's less automotive transports happening on the Transporeon platform. Conversely, we can see in retail and consumer products, we can see the units -- the transport units continuing to grow on a year-over-year basis. So that's -- that insight can shape how we allocate capital internally for which end markets to go after in which geographies to go after. And the Transporeon, as you know, is also a majority European-based today. And that gives us, I'd say, actually, probably a little bit incremental level of confidence for that business as compared to North America. I mean, both markets are in a freight recession. But at the moment, I like some of the setup of Europe, especially if Germany to the Infrastructure Bill.
Chad Dillard: That’s all from me. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Mason with Baird. Robert, please go ahead.
Robert Mason: Yes, good morning. The field systems ARR growth kind of steps off the page. It's pretty impressive. I was going to see if you could drill down a little further into that. You called out both on the positioning service as well as the civil construction side. How did the growth shake out there? And I'm just are we working off a smaller base and some of the newer offerings driving the organic growth to that 25% level. And part of the reason I ask is it seems like we should expect some moderation through the year just based on the guidance and how we should think about cadencing there as well.
Rob Painter: Hey Rob, thanks for the question. The shift to ARR in the business has been very intentional. So, it's for sure not by accident. The teams have done a lot of work to transition business models. We stand at $358 million of ARR. That's a lot of ARR. And hey, that's less than the $1.29 billion of ARR and AECO or the $459 million of ARR in the transportation and logistics businesses. That 25% has an aspect of strong execution, and I'll come back to that. And it also has an aspect of there being us being newer in the transition. So, there is a lapping effect by the second half of the year that will bring us down to the guide that Phil put forward in that business and still to a very healthy level of growth. Another reason the like that ARR within field systems is I think over time we've had, there's been a view on us as cyclicality within hardware business. And to an extent, that's true. At the same time, we see a secular adoption of technology. But to the extent that undertone of cyclicality this ARR provides, let's say, mutes that level of underlying tone of cyclicality that would be in the business, which is another reason to like what we're doing there with ARR and field systems. So, with respect to calling out some of the specific areas of growth, I talked about Works Plus, that's machine control and guidance offering, we continue to grow there. And our survey business, we have a product or a solution called DA2 or also called Catalyst. So think of that as positioning GIS as a service application on a global basis, that continues to have very strong growth. And our positioning services business, as you know, as we deliver centimeter-level accuracy on a ubiquitous basis around the world, whether that's on farms or the surveyors or construction sites. That's been a great business for us for a long time. We've expanded those capabilities in the automotive market. And so we see growth there in that automotive end market. Think about lane detection and safety systems there on paths towards automation. And then even we've got examples in our survey business of taking product and moving it fully to a ratable basis. So, a good amount of things happening, whether it's a full offering of the entirety of the system or it's a split hybrid offering where you're paying a nominal amount upfront for the hardware and then the rest through the software. And at a certain level, that makes sense because increasingly, in the world, we think about software-defined systems, software-defined hardware. And I think we're pretty well ahead of the curve in the competitive environment with the way we're approaching this market, and the other results speak for themselves at the moment.
Robert Mason: Yes, that's great. And just, Rob, you referenced Germany in particular, just we'll see how their plan plays out. But could you just speak to how you think you're positioned there? I know some of your bundles vary by region, but just in that region, in particular. And when would expect to potentially see some uplift around what you're talking about?
Rob Painter: Yes. So, I was just in Germany at bauma and then actually was there again about a week ago at bauma, I'd really give a shout out not only to our team but our partners at SITECH, Deutsche Land. They're just doing a terrific job executing. The team that SITECH team operates at scale. It's the largest competitor in the market and that relative market share, I think, matters. They were able to pull off an off-site even at bauma to do an off-site to see the technology in action on a small job site. And that's like that goes so far in terms of driving business. In fact, they did drive millions of euros of new business. And you could see that just -- I would call it, the quality of the execution that I mentioned in one of the answers, the Siteworks product and bringing ability to support to buckets, which is very much a European need, including in Germany. So giving them additional products and capabilities drives optimism in the market. Now, some of that optimism and [indiscernible] will be coming off of low lows -- so I'll take that, though, to the extent that any optimism there is a good thing. And obviously, it speaks for itself probably in the Civil business that's going to correlate to infrastructure. Any sign of support for that regardless of the package, you're right. It hasn't happened yet. Let say just to talk of it is a new kind of conversation in the country and that provided -- has provided a level of optimism. On the software side of the business, I'd say the market continues to be healthy and think about vertical construction in that respect and we have a number of capabilities. There are a different set of capabilities that we have North America, it's a little more engineering-centric than construction-centric. And there, the team really, I just think they do a nice job of controlling the things they can control, and that includes how we go to market, how we transform that and how we package our offerings through the TC1 bundle, and they all seem to be working at the moment.
Robert Mason: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry, please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Rob, if you just go back to AECO really outstanding ARR organic growth in the quarter. Can you just talk about how much TC1 contributed? What was that cross-selling contribution versus other drivers of the acceleration in an environment where a lot of businesses are not accelerating? And then just to put some context around your comments around longer sales cycle that you're seeing, is that to imply that ARR growth for AECO could slow somewhere to the mid-teens in the second quarter based on what you're seeing? Can we just put a finer point on just quantifying what that longer sales cycle means in your prepared remarks? Thanks.
Rob Painter: Jerry, thanks for the question. Okay. So ARR in the first quarter, up 19% ACV bookings in the high teens. If we look at this ACV bookings and double-click about two-thirds of those bookings are TC1 bookings. So, TC1 now is the majority of the bookings that we have. TC1 itself is a commercial framework for how we do business. And in some cases, you could be on a TC framework and still buying an individual solution. Let's say, the good news within that would be the gives us an easier way to cross-sell and upsell to that customer because they already have the basis of foundational basis of the contract. Of course, what we think about most are the bundles within TC1 and there, we've got over 20 purpose-built bundles. So, we continue to roll those out globally. More and more of the bundles are making their way to Europe, and all of that helps drive those TC1 bookings. The TC1 bookings themselves on a year-over-year basis were well in excess of the of the overall bookings in the queue being in the high teens. So, I just can't stress enough how important this is to us and how good this has been for our efforts to go after that cross-sell and upsell, which at Investor Day, we quantified as about a $1 billion opportunity. So there's a lot to like with the TC1 and what the team is doing. And then I also want to mention, it's not just linkages within AECO, but think about TC1 linkages to field systems, linking estimating or tracking capability that may be technically in an AECO software to what we're doing with the field instruments that show up in field systems. The customer is not going to care about which segment of Trimble they're doing business with. They're doing business. with Trimble. And these are workflows that we can uniquely deliver. So, expect to see more connections of TC1 bundles into the civil market here this year and beyond. Then you asked about sales cycles I've seen it more on the very largest customers within AECO. Think about -- to be even more specific, think about buying ERPs, construction ERPs construction ERP, if you delay your decision by some weeks, you haven't fundamentally altered your ability to deliver value. And so it kind of doesn't surprise me that we've seen a little bit of hesitation. In terms of -- and that's at the largest end of the market. And so when we see things like that happen, and we are pretty good about moving the motions to other parts that are moving faster. So, we've seen more growth in small to midsize contractors. And we'll move the people and the capital to where the business is and to where it's ready to go. That business at the enterprise level, it hasn't gone away. It doesn't shape -- or translate in any kind of meaningful difference of view that we have. And the nature of an ARR business is you can't really go down all that fast, especially in the second quarter. So feel good about the business that we have in front of us and the trajectory of that. I'd say in the public sector as well, like that one, by the way, Phil commented on the business we do with the federal government. We also sell the state and local governments. And some of those have been a little bit slower, but they've been offset by where we've seen the pockets of strength, whether that's sub industry segments or it's a customer size segments. So I hope that helps, Jerry gave you some color.
Jerry Revich: Super helpful, Rob. Thank you. And then in terms of P&L margins, Phil, obviously, you've got a transition going on with the divestiture. Can you just talk about where the quarter came in relative to your plan? It looks like maybe there's some work to do to get to the full year guide that's better than normal seasonality. Can you just expand on the timing of when those trended costs go away and how it's playing out versus your plan?
Phil Sawarynski: Yes. Thanks Jerry. So, as we think about it, as you said, with the mobility divestiture, we do have some stranded costs this year. And so that we're going to start out the year around that 21%. And then our guide is still at that 24% at the -- for the year. And so we continue to see the margin improvement. So, think about transport and the bookings and strength that we had over the last year. As we talked about, that bookings takes a while to manifest because of the ramp time. So we start to see the inflection sort of as we progress throughout the year, and so that helps with the margin expansion as we continue to move throughout the year with that. As far as the stranded cost, as you know, some of that is around software contracts and other things that are hard to get out of immediately. So that will take a little bit of time. So, we do expect that to still be a headwind in 2025. But as we start to move into 2026, along with some of the actions and things like that, we're taking -- we think it will be neutral as we go forward after 2025.
Jerry Revich: The downside of those software contracts. Thank you.
Rob Painter: All right. Well, we appear to have lost our moderator here for the call. This is Rob Painter. I just want to thank everybody for attending today's call. And with that, we will hang up.
Operator: That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-19 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Krista and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, President and CEO. Rob, you may begin.
Rob Painter : Welcome everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business, our recently divested mobility business, and the extra week that we had in the fourth quarter of 2024. Starting on Slide 4, we ended the year on an emphatically strong note. As reported, fourth quarter revenue at $983 million, ARR at $2.26 billion, and EPS at $0.89 were all above the midpoint of our guidance. On an as-adjusted basis, revenue was up 9% for the quarter and 6% for the year, with ARR up 16%. Gross margins at 71.7% represent the first time that we have crossed the 70% level. Kudos to our global colleagues and partners. Phil will walk us through additional details of as-adjusted performance in his commentary, which is necessary to set the correct baseline for fiscal 2025. Moving to Slide 5, our performance in the fourth quarter capped a transformative year for Trimble. For those newer to the Trimble story, we call our strategy Connect and Scale. Our technology is digitizing and transforming work in the construction, geospatial, and transportation industries. These markets are large, global, underserved, and under-penetrated with a combined addressable market of over $70 billion. By executing our strategy, We have simplified, focused, and strengthened Trimble. We now report under three segments, with leadership perfectly aligned to this structure. We have also transformed our business model in the process, delivering compelling and compounding financial returns. On an as-reported basis, between 2019 and 2024, ARR increased from $1.2 billion to over $2.26 billion. Recurring revenue doubled as a percent of overall revenue to 62% percent and overall software and services increased to 76% of revenue. Gross margins in 2024 at 68.2% have increased over 1000 basis points. All of this has translated into over 400 basis points of EBITDA improvement with 2024 ending at 27.2%. At our Investor Day in December, we outlined the progression and direction of our strategy, detailing our right to win at the intersection of product, technology, and go-to-market. We laid out our [3-4-30] (ph) ambition through 2027 to deliver $3 billion of ARR, $4 billion of revenue, and 30% EBITDA margins. By delivering transformative outcomes for our customers, we are poised to deliver compelling returns to our shareholders. Today, I'll highlight the last few months of Connect and Scale strategic progression in three areas. First, product and go-to-market through the lens of our customers. Second, technology innovation. And third, capital allocation. In the fourth quarter, we engaged with thousands of our customers and partners. Our Dimensions user conference, which focuses on the engineering and construction industry, had more than 7,000 registered attendees. We ran sessions on-site at the venue and off-site at a purpose-built proving ground where we could demonstrate our field solutions in the dirt. We had the opportunity to showcase our product innovation progression as we move from point solutions to workflow to ecosystems. This progression uniquely leverages the vast installed base, we have across the life cycle continuum of the engineering and construction industry. At the off-site venue, pictured on the cover slide, more than 25 of our OEM partners demonstrated onboard and offboard technology, serving a large array of machine types, and we were able to showcase our unique office to field workflow connectivity. The unique value we are offering to the ecosystem is evidenced by the strong growth in ARR in both AECO and Field Systems. Further evidence of this unique value is in the record level of ACV bookings in AECO in the quarter. In transportation, we see and hear our customers asking us to address similar opportunities as our construction customers. They increasingly seek data-rich solutions delivered in a common and connected data environment. While the freight market macros remain challenged, our team is doing a good job controlling what we can control. For example, the Transporeon business achieved an all-time record level of bookings in both the fourth quarter and the year. When the freight markets return to growth, this business is well-positioned to showcase its true financial potential. Complementing the product direction is the innovation that has taken hold with our go-to-market initiatives across the company, which have never been better aligned to unlock the potential of Trimble. On the technology innovation front, we continue to progress state-of-the-art and core positioning technologies, along with connectivity, collaboration and visualization. We believe we are well positioned to be a winner in the data-centric and AI forward world, leveraging trillion billions, millions and thousands. Trillions of dollars of construction programs run through Trimble. Tens of billions of freight run through Trimble. We have millions of users of our software. We manage millions of miles of our roadways and we have hundreds of thousands of instruments and machines out in the field in the real world operated by Trimble technology. Over the last few months, we have increased the adoption of AI to fuel our own productivity, creativity and to drive profit expansion. We've been launching agents to better support customers, product managers and our sellers. The potential is exciting, and we will continue to lean into the technology to drive both internal efficiencies and amplify customer value. Finally, I'll cover three topics on the capital allocation front. Starting with the divestiture of our mobility business, which we closed on February 8. We are a significant shareholder in platform science and we refreshed an ongoing and important commercial relationship with their team to link telemetry with our broad set of capabilities, including dispatch scheduling, routing, navigation, maintenance visibility, freight procurement and more. We are accounting for this investment under the cost method of accounting, where our investment will be represented on our balance sheet rather than the non-GAAP P&L. Second, we remain committed to executing our share buyback plan. We continue to believe that repurchasing Trimble stock as an attractive opportunity for capital deployment given our share price today. As further evidence of our commitment, today, we are announcing that our Board increased our repurchase authorization to $1 billion. Third, given the strength and momentum in the underlying business and particularly the success we have demonstrated executing our TC1 platform strategy in AECO, we intend to play offense on the acquisition front. Tuck-in opportunities that can quickly integrate and be put in the hands of our sellers are the most obvious category, building on the success we have had with such moves over the past few years. We will also opportunistically consider large opportunities should they present themselves, particularly instruction software. Though the bar will be high, anchored in our disciplined focus on ROI and compared to the returns we can generate from buying back our own shares. Trimble enters 2025 with a balance sheet well below our leverage targets with continued strong free cash flow generation and with shares trading at levels we find attractive. Collectively, this gives us a range of good options to consider as we drive value for shareholders. Phil, over to you.
Phil Sawarynski: Thanks, Rob. On January 16, we filed our 2023 amended 10-K along with our 10-Qs for the first, second and third quarters of 2024. As we messaged throughout the process, there is no change to our filed financial results. Our full attention is now focused on working with our audit provider to complete the 2024 audit. The good news is that the 2024 audit work builds on the 2023 work. The challenge is that because of the 2023 filing delays, the timeline is compressed. We are likely to file our 2024 10-K after the March 4 due date and are working to file within the 15-day extension that is allowed under SEC rules. At this time, we believe any delays to our filing would be solely due to the tight timeframe. We are, of course working hard and doing everything we can to file our 10-K on time. Let's review the fourth quarter and the year for 2024 starting on Slide 6. Unless otherwise noted, I'll be talking about our as-adjusted numbers, which remove the effects of the recent divestitures in the 53rd-week including the January 1 term license renewals. As reported numbers, along with the reconciliation are provided in the Appendix. Organic revenue was up 9% for the quarter and 6% for the year with ARR up 16%. We achieved EBITDA margins of 27.8% for the quarter and the year, both of which expanded nearly 100 basis points. Reported EPS was at $0.89 for the quarter and $2.85 for the year. The reason we didn't see an even larger EPS outperform was primarily due to additional incentive compensation accruals and additional sales commissions. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items on Slide 7. Our reported free cash flow for the year was $498 million, which represents a conversion rate of 0.71 to net income. Adjusting for $204 million of M&A related tax payments and transaction costs, cash flow was over $700 million with a conversion rate of approximately 1 times. Our balance sheet is strong with over $700 million of cash and a leverage ratio of less than 1 times which is well below our long-term targeted rate of 2.5 times. Let's shift to a segment review of the numbers before we close with guidance. Starting with AECO on Slide 8. 18% ARR growth for the quarter and the year and operating income at 31.2% for the quarter and the year. This is a scaled business nearing $1.3 billion of ARR and revenue and operating well above the Rule of 40. In fact, it was greater than a Rule of 45 for both the quarter and the full year. ACV bookings increased over 20% in the quarter, providing momentum to our ongoing commitment to grow ARR at our long-term model rate in the mid-teens. We are especially pleased with the ongoing performance of our Trimble Construction One offerings, as well as a level of growth in cross-selling and up-selling initiatives. Next, Field Systems on Slide 9. While for the year, revenue was slightly down on an organic basis, it inflected positively in the second half of the year and was up 2% in the fourth quarter. Of particular note, ARR growth at 21% for the quarter and the year demonstrates the intentionality of our business model conversions. In almost every business where we have implemented these changes, we have seen the addressable market expand. It should also be noted that the recurring revenue conversions were 150 basis points headwind to 2024 annual revenue growth, thus the two must be looked at in combination. It should further be noted that the team executed on these transitions while increasing operating income margins to 30.1% for the year. Finally, Transportation and Logistics on Slide 10. Revenue and ARR were up 8% both for the quarter and the year, led by growth above the segment average from our MAPS business and the Transporeon business. Operating margins were 24.1% for the year. Transporeon continues to deliver in a challenging freight environment with strong double-digit bookings growth for the year, including several cross-sells with North American customers, as the Connect & Scale playbook is being replicated in the Transportation segment. Before we turn to guidance, let us set context with a few considerations related to tariffs and foreign currency translation. Based on what we know today, we have not modeled any impact of new tariffs into our guidance. Given the software centricity of Trimble today and the geographic diversity of our revenue and supply chains, we are confident we can navigate the environment with minimal financial impact. With respect to foreign currency, our EPS has historically been naturally hedged against currency moves given our global workforce. However, with the growth in AECO and Transporeon outside the U.S. we now expect a slight amount of foreign currency translation headwind to flow through to EPS. For 2025 guidance, on Slide 11, the midpoint of our as-reported guidance is $3.42 billion and $2.87 EPS. This includes one month of mobility with approximately $20 million in revenue and under $0.01 of EPS. On an as-adjusted basis, our EPS guide implies low-to-mid teens EPS growth year-over-year, consistent with our long-term model. Our guidance assumes the strong U.S. dollar holds and we have incorporated into our guidance full year foreign currency impacts on revenue of minus $50 million, ARR of minus $30 million and EPS of approximately minus $0.04. Relative to our initial fiscal 2025 guidance we provided in December at our Investor Day, on a constant currency basis, we have raised our revenue and EPS guidance. For first quarter guidance on Slide 13, we expect as-reported revenue to be in the $794 million to $824 million range and EPS $0.55 to $0.61. We have provided an updated view of calendarization in the earnings supplement on our investor site, which is in-line with what we shared at Investor Day. On an as-adjusted basis, organic growth for the first quarter is in the minus 1% to plus 3% range. Please note that there is no January 1 in our 2025 fiscal first quarter. It was in the fourth quarter of 2024. Adjusting for this would result in first quarter 2025 organic growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint. Also note that the January 1, 2026 will occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Both revenue and operating margins are expected to trend up in both absolute and percentage terms as we move throughout the year, reflecting the fact that our portfolio is now more heavily weighted to the growing recurring revenue business models and less impacted by seasonality in field systems. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Phil. I appreciate that divestitures and the 53rd week make comparables a bit difficult. We encourage you to refer to the supplement on our website where we outline the moving parts. To keep things simple, whether we are talking on as reported or an as-adjusted basis, the message is the same. We ended 2024 on a strong note with a significant beat on our numbers, and we are carrying that momentum into 2025 with raised guidance on a constant currency basis. I'll close with a reflection on confidence and humility. Confidence that every turn is what we deliver to our customers, improving performance and unlocking insights with technology. As we execute our Connect and Scale strategy in 2025 and beyond, we are confident in our ability to execute the strategy and excited about the opportunities in front of us. We are also humble as we navigate the uncertainty in the current environment. Our highly experienced and values-driven team is hard at work to achieve the potential of Trimble. I'll close by extending my gratitude to our colleagues, partners and shareholders for their ongoing support. Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jason Celino : [indiscernible] Rob, I'm curious how you're thinking about the current macro environment. There's pushes and pulls and we're wondering if you've had a chance to gauge sentiment among your owners and construction type customers?
Rob Painter : Hi, Jason, thanks for the question. You broke up there at the beginning, but I think you are asking about the current macro environment, I think with a bias towards what we're hearing in construction. In that respect, I'd say, geographically North America continues to be the strongest of the geographies where we participate. If I look within North America, you probably won't be surprised to hear that segments such as data centers, energy markets are good verticals for us. They are performing well, sentiment remains strong in those respects. We see differences, I would say, within the United States. The Southeast tends to outperform geographically relative to most other states. You follow the money, there is still the infrastructure bill, the Chips Act. There's a lot of backlog that contractors have. Now with respect to contracts in the backlog, there are fewer new projects that the contractors have. So they are working down their backlogs. What we see from our own data is that our customers are hiring. And as they are hiring, that's a catalyst for the adoption of technology. So you're right, there are some puts and takes both within North America and around the world, but the overall sentiment remains healthy.
Jason Celino : Okay. And then related to tariffs, it sounds like you are not modeling any financial impact. Is it because you don't know, and it is still kind of a wait and see? It's just I think that especially with some of your AECO segments, they would be sensitive to different price changes or perceived price changes? Thanks.
Phil Sawarynski : Hi, Jason, it's Phil. So on the tariffs, if you remember, we're about three quarters now, software services recurring. And so our exposure is really a lot smaller than it would have been in the past to those. On the more discrete items around Canada and Mexico that have been out there and now have been delayed, we believe it is a relatively small impact. And our supply chain and our operations team is well prepared for some contingency plans that we see just offsetting that. What we haven't really modeled in is there has been a lot of explicit answers, let us say, on the tariffs as we go forward when we think about any sort of reciprocal impacts and things like that as we think more globally. So right now, we do have confidence in our operations team. We have a global supply chain. We have opportunities and contingency plans that we can enact depending on what it manifest. But just to be clear, we have looked at it, and we don't believe there's a material impact on the financials based on the information we've seen so far.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Kristen Owen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start with the 2025 guidance, the AECO ARR growth expectations in the mid-teens. Just given some of the changes that you made in 2024 around the commercial organization, bundling, how you are thinking about the contribution of new logos versus cross-sell, up-sell in that 2025 framework?
Rob Painter : Hi, good morning, Kristen, it is Rob. I will take the question. We see about two-thirds from existing customers and probably a little bit less than [one-third] (ph) from new logos. So at Investor Day, you'll remember we talked about what we see as a $1 billion opportunity and cross-sell, up-sell within the portfolio. And that's consistent with that view, we have coming into 2025 with the business. And you are right that the investments that we've made and the underlying systems, the transformation we've taken into the product, as well as to the go-to-market side of the house, position us well to start to go -- or to continue to tackle this opportunity.
Kristen Owen : That's actually a good segue into my second question, which is a little bit more of a big picture question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, Rob some of the AI agents that you've been deploying internally, can you expand on how you are thinking about operating efficiency opportunities? We've been hearing examples of 100 to 200 basis points of sound margin by applying AI to internal functions. How would you benchmark that opportunity internally for Trimble?
Rob Painter : I think the 100 to 200 basis points that you hear in operational efficiencies, strikes me as aspirational as opposed to currently delivered. So I think if you really break down the operations, you've got -- just take it by the P&L, you've got COGS, let's say you've got R&D, you've got G&A and you have sales and marketing. And I think they are differential within each of those. I think we're -- it's probably easiest to see some of the ROI already would be in the R&D function. And if you think about internal usage in R&D, tend to think software and the majority of our engineers are software engineers these days. And then within that double-click again and break-down the software development life cycle, the efficiencies you can see on QA and testing is, I think different than what you see in development, is different than what you see in hosting, is different than what we see in provisioning. So I think it's important to double click. So QA testing, I'd say probably the highest ROI we can see from using GitHub CoPilot. On the development side, we probably see we talk about, call it 5% to 10% productivity and you are measuring that by more lines of code checked in, but that's not a perfect measure, of course, it is just having more lines of code checked in. We see it in the marketing functions internally driving more automation. We see product managers using it to help create the marketing requirements documents, as well as the product -- more technical product specifications. On the cost of goods sold, we can see efficiencies with how we're supporting our customers, providing more self-help tools along the way. So a good number of activities that we have in motion. I think that level of operating efficiency that you mentioned that range is a good aspirational target. But I would say, we don't -- I can't say that I can quantify that today, Kristen.
Kristen Owen: Great. Thank you so much for the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho : Hello, good morning. Rob, I wanted to just build on your comments around the data centricity of Trimble's platform, particularly around the AI opportunity. And can you speak to why your data is unique and what you can do with that data for your customers? Is this going to be new products or enhancements of existing products? Just trying to understand how Trimble is positioned for this revolution? Thank you.
Rob Painter : Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning. What I see that is unique about the data reflects what's unique about Trimble, and that is our products and services to connect the physical and the digital world. That means connecting work in the field and work in the office. That means connecting the hardware and the software of Trimble. So if we take engineering and construction industry, think about that for a moment, the field systems business that we have combined with AECO is incredibly unique. We've been pursuing industries where we can connect users data workflow across the stakeholders of that industry. So today, when we have our AECO business, that's architects, engineers, contractors and owners. Each of those is over a $200 million business on its own within each of those pillars today. So there is a unique ability to connect field office. There's a unique ability to link the stakeholders across the industry life cycle continuum. That life cycle being from plan to design, to build, to operate. That creates a unique corpus of data. And as our customers increasingly are asking us to help them solve their higher order problems to unlock the data that they have at -- Trimble and non-Trimble data, by the way that we believe, positions us in a unique fashion and certainly represents a lot of the conversations I'm in with our customers, and I'd say particularly probably our bigger customers. So what we can do with that data that we have is we can develop unique sets of workflows. It reflects in the unique partnerships that we have. So say, a unique workflow move from scan to BIM, it could be – we are doing workflow with digital supply chains, that's linking to modeling and estimating, that's linking payments and ERP systems, that's linking about progress to plan in a civil construction context. There's just an enormous amount of possibilities in a bright future I see for us. And I would say in that baseball analogy, it's probably batting practice, or that early in the game.
Jonathan Ho : Excellent. That's really helpful. Just as a follow-up, any thoughts around the U.S. federal government. Can you give us a sense of how big or small that is in terms of contribution and any potential impacts there? Thank you.
Rob Painter : Yes. Hey, on the federal government side, so those -- the orders we predominantly have are in field systems today for us. So it is the survey equipment, GIS mapping equipment, machine control, tends to be the biggest consumer of what we sell to the federal government. The federal government work is naturally lumpy with -- we've had for a few years, it feels like government by continuing resolution. That's made it even more lumpy than we had seen in the past. When we look into 2025 and the guide that we have there, what you will see is that field systems is effectively a flat guide. If we were to take the federal business and do an apple-to-apple on it -- we also have subscription conversions by the way, happening in field systems, we would be up over 300 basis points -- sorry, 3% organic growth. if we adjusted for that. So what I'm saying is we see the federal government, we are projecting that to be down for us in 2025 relative to 2024 and still a very important customer for Trimble.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Chad Dillard : My question is on the TC1 regional rollout. I think you guys had some momentum early next year pause to focus on some of the accounting questions. And I just wanted to get a better sense for like where you are in reaccelerating that and how to think about that contribution to growth in 2025? And maybe if you can just update the road map for how you are thinking about it now?
Rob Painter : Hi, good morning Chad, thanks for the question. So we continue to feel really good about Trimble Construction One and the success that we are having with that. Part of that success, as you note, is regional rollouts of that. So North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, so think about it in that order. I think we are in a good spot in Europe as we roll that out, especially coming into this year after our sales kick-offs. I'd say Asia Pacific still has – it is coming next in a more meaningful way. So Europe is the focus on the rollout of that and that's incorporated into our thoughts for the segment. We continue to get very good feedback from our customers around the world on that. One of the things you do as you go region to region is we have different types of capabilities by region, so it is not one global answer for TC1 and so we continue to dial in the bundles that make sense for the regions and take the feedback from our customers on what they need and what they are looking for from us and we saw that reflected in the bookings performance at the end of the fourth quarter. The team did a terrific job posting very strong growth and ACV bookings on a year-over-year basis. So feeling good about it, Chad.
Chad Dillard : That's helpful. And then just shifting gears over to field systems. So you are guiding organic revenue growth to flat, but I wanted to get a little bit more color on Civil infrastructure in 2025, what's embedded for that business? Can you talk about what contribution some of the recent changes in terms of channel dynamics that you may see? And then just any bookings color you can share at least for the fourth quarter for that business?
Rob Painter : Yes. Sure Chad. This is Rob. I will take that one. On Field Systems overall, if we think about the close of the year in the fourth quarter on an as-adjusted basis, we were up 2% organic. If we exclude that federal business we are up 3.5%, and so I look to that as a marker for where we are -- with what we'll call the field sales. And so in the field, the team is growing organically, and we project that going into next year. In the fourth quarter, ARR was up 21%. And so the bookings also reflected that level of strength of performance in fact, [indiscernible] fastest, highest ARR grower on a year-over-year business. The team has done a tremendous job of working the business models. Tremendous enough that, that creates a headwind to the revenue growth as we complete those conversions. So if we look into 2025, the revenue guide is flat. But if we were to adjust for that Fed and the subscription conversions, which are a headwind to the revenue growth, we'd be up over 300 basis points of growth in our guide for 2025. Now within the portfolio in Field Systems, think about three pillars that we have in that business. So the civil infrastructure business that we have, I'll come back to that; second, is our geospatial survey business; and third is what we call advanced positioning. Advanced positioning, think of the positioning services that we offer right that centimeter level accuracy ubiquitous around the world that actually has the most recurring revenue in that pillar and that we expect to continue to grow next year, and that's in our -- certainly in our thoughts in the ARR guide that we have. From the Civil business, that pillar we expect growth. That is the punchline. So we expect the civil infrastructure business to be a grower for us, had a strong fourth quarter. We like what we've seen coming in here to the beginning of the year in the business. So the -- and we've seen it actually globally. So the business is growing. It is performing. There's a number of catalysts for that. Of course, what we sell is productivity when you put the guidance equipment -- our guidance technology on the iron out in the field, it is like fundamental productivity 30%, 40% in a move the dirt right the first time as a profound value proposition. It continues -- customers continue to have problems finding labor. We can make an inexperienced operator good and a good operator great by using the technology. The team has done a nice job as well of product innovation, which we were able to showcase at our user conference. So we have a new -- relatively, I should say, new product BX992, and that helps us reach the tier machine control market. So a number of activities on a number of fronts, and it's leading into a nice performance from that business. By implication, then we expect of the pillars, we expect the survey business to be flat to down into next year, but that's also where we have a lot of that federal business.
Chad Dillard: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Clay on for Jerry. First one for me. Can you flush out the performance of Transporeon? What was organic growth in the quarter and logo growth retention rate?
Rob Painter : Hi, good morning Clay. This is Rob. I'll take that question. The Transporeon team did a terrific job, obviously, with controlling what they can control. The macros continue to be difficult and well, actually really globally in the freight market with Transporeon as a European-centric business where that market is challenged. However, in a very good way, the team had record fourth quarter bookings. They had record bookings for the year. Phil mentioned over 20% bookings growth for the year. So that is -- reflects both existing customers and new logos. We won many new logos throughout the year. Some of the biggest company names you'll find in any vertical. And the team has done a nice job of cross-selling within that. So we looked at the sum -- and by the way, on the product side teams, that's probably -- that team has done some of the most innovative things relative to AI, both for our own internal usage as well as external capabilities. We have an autonomous procurement, autonomous quotation offering that's getting nice uptake and the team is doing a nice job and also working to bring capabilities from Europe into North America. And then we've done some product consolidation globally as well to drive efficiencies and some synergies within that. So as Phil said in his comments when the freight markets turn this business is positioned to perform well and to be able to demonstrate the potential of -- the financial potential of this business.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And switching gears here. How do you view the product vitality of the geospatial and heavy civil portfolio, I believe you touched on a little bit on the last question, but just some color there.
Rob Painter : So the team, I think, does a really nice job of innovation. And just to put a broader context on that, over the last five years, Trimble has put about $2.5 billion in the research and development. So we don't just talk -- like empty talk about innovation. We're putting our money where our mouth is, both AECO Transportation and Field Systems. So if I think about product vitality within the portfolio, I'll take those three pillars. If we take our Civil business, it's -- I talked about BX992 or the site works as a technology, that's getting us to new machine types and new price points. If I look at our survey business, the team launched last year, the R980 and that has improved communications over the prior version of the R12, which was an innovation in and of itself. If I looked in advanced positioning pillar, the team last year had launched IonoGuard, and that's correcting for errors in the atmosphere. So you can do the solar cycles that we've had to get accurate -- highly accurate performance, which you need, particularly like in the mines and in the field, in agriculture, to have that ubiquitous accuracy is very difficult to do, and the team really just had some really novel innovation. So innovation is really driving -- drives a refresh for our customers of their own technology. So like what I'm seeing from the team and like what they are working on. I talked about hardware innovation, but I should also mention the software innovation across that portfolio, and that's reflected in that 21% ARR growth that we had in the fourth quarter. I think I'm really excited about what the team is doing and reality capture. These days, data is not the topic. We got -- we're flooded with data. It is information that we need. And so Trimble is in the business of collecting enormous data sets and the software activities are converting that data and information and actionable information. So in reality capture you can apply AI on that to do feature extraction and then from that feature extraction to create actionable workflows back out in field. So a lot of good things happening in the business.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks I appreciate it.
Phil Sawarynski : You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Tilton: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I actually have a multi-parter on the construction business and then just a quick follow-up on transportation side. I guess I'm trying to understand, maybe diving a little bit deeper. Are you seeing any change in demand from the construction end market post-election here in the states? And the second part of that question is you did make it a point to highlight the potential for some larger acquisitions, specifically focused on construction. Is there anything that you feel that is missing from the TC1 bundle or the construction portfolio today that you guys are most interested in? And then I got a follow-up.
Rob Painter : Hi, Josh good morning, on the change in demand since the election or -- since the election or since President came into office, nothing discernible is the punch-line. I mean you hear sentiment, you hear expectations of are we going to have onshoring, reshoring, or supply chain is going to move around. But I think overall, we are in a wait -- more in a wait-and-see mode. I haven't seen any kind of fundamental movement, let us say, on new projects coming out. So let's wait and see and as they ask the same question next quarter, and maybe we'll have some more data to be able to provide at that on that because we – about one-third of construction in the U.S. is running through our system. So I think we would have a pretty good view on what's coming, both at the contractor level, as well as the -- as well we owner level. In terms of the M&A side within construction to answer your question, I think about it in a couple of respects. One access is geography. And the other is, I call it, is really more product-oriented. At a geographic level, when we talk about our Trimble Construction One offering, it's really a commercial framework, we have different capabilities around the world. We don't have the exact same capabilities around the world. And so we look geographically -- let's say, take a construction ERP system and construction ERP has done extraordinarily well for us in a number of markets, most notably North America. We don't have a construction ERP. I'll take Central Europe -- or you could say Southeast Asia, you could say, India. We will look at those markets and where we think we can stitch together a good offering, it begs the question built by a partner, right? So we will go through that analysis, and we do go through that ourselves for how to geographically expand and even strengthen the offering from a product capability side and gaps. I think a little bit less -- I don't think about gap so much to the extent that there is gaps that's where tuck-ins can come into play. Often, the tuck-ins are really more features than they are independent businesses that fit really well within our platform offering. Also think about it on the access of segmentation. So let us say, if we play in one tier of the market, let us say, in one business that we play mid- -- more mid and large contractor, within that segmentation, we may -- we'll ask the question okay, if we want to play more in the, say, the small-mid, how would we do that? Or if we want to play in the largest of the large, how would we do that? Do we extend the product offering? Or could we go acquire an installed base and then bring in the rest of the capabilities that we have to link bundle, cross-sell and up-sell. So that's the way we think about it, Josh. It's not -- I'm not being overly specific on purpose, but hopefully, that helps frame how we go about it.
Joshua Tilton: It definitely helps. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the transportation side. I think it's clear like Transporeon bookings still pretty solid, even though freight market remains challenged. How do we think about what bookings for this business or for Transporeon will look like when the freight market recovers?
Rob Painter: Good question. Actually, that is a good question. I think that on the bookings growth itself would be probably pretty similar. It is not obvious to me that it would be that much higher. I mean, okay other than -- okay, the right sentiment is better and there's more spend available, you would think that would be a positive catalyst. But we actually have quite a reasonably low barrier to entry with our model because it is a transactional model. And so in a transactional model, really the more fundamental thing in the freight recovery is more -- and by the way, economic recovery that translates into a freight market recovery is more transactions happening for each of the customers that we already have. And that's where -- and we've seen this in the business historically, as when you come out of a down cycle, you can have a very fast recovery or a very fast improvement. I mean it is already a very good business, a very fast improvement. I think operating leverage when I say that, and the nature of the gross margins are [indiscernible] in that business. So you drive a really nice inflection in the number of transport executions or loads moving on our system, and you can drop a significant amount of operating leverage quickly. So I would look more at that, Josh, than I would the bookings.
Joshua Tilton : Makes sense. Thank you guys. And congrats on the quarter.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Tami. I had two questions. The first is around the share repurchase authorization. Do you have a plan in terms of quarterly cadence? Or do you expect to complete the entire authorization this year? And on a related note, if -- as you mentioned your plans on M&A, how would that impact the share repurchase for the year, if at all?
Phil Sawarynski : Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Phil. So as we noted earlier, we just replaced our existing authorization with a new $1 billion authorization. And the way we are thinking about that is we've talked earlier about the $625 million that was remaining on the prior, and that's an amount related to the proceeds from the [Ag JV] (ph). And so we're still anticipating, let's call it, over Q1 and Q2 to initiate repurchases focused on that first $625 million that we've already talked about executing. And so the way I think about that is between Q1 and Q2, probably two-thirds of it hit in Q1 and about one-third of it hit in Q2. And then beyond that, with the remaining $375 million, what I talked about at Investor Day was at or above one-third of the free cash flow, is going back to share repurchases. So I think the way to think about that is roughly $700 million, let's call it, of free cash flow and one-third of that $200 million a year and so that's roughly $50 million a quarter that I would expect once we get past that initial $625 million. That's the way I think about modeling it. And I think your question on the M&A is, again it depends on the M&A. But right now, with what we are focused primarily on the tuck-ins, we believe we have plenty of firepower to continue to do the tuck-in work on the M&A. If we do something bigger, we do believe we still have more than enough capacity to do that. And just a reminder, we -- our targeted leverage rate over the long term is about 2.5 times, and we're well, well underneath that. We are well below 1 times right now. So we have plenty of room on our balance sheet.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's super helpful. And my second question is around the FY '25 guide compared to your initial outlook laid out in the Investor Day which areas have actually led to the positive change in the organic revenue guidance in constant currency basis?
Phil Sawarynski : Yes, good question. So at Investor Day, just to walk through the delta, we had about -- relative to Investor Day, we had about a $40 million FX headwind on revenue. And so the puts and takes were roughly $3.4 billion is what we guided at Investor Day. Our current guide as reported is $3.42 million. And so add $20 million for the mobility -- for one month of the mobility business that we had in January before we closed on that. And then that $40 million that we had a headwind of FX, think about that as the effective increase to offset the FX on the organic growth. And I'd say that it's really across primarily the AECO and the Field Systems businesses with the performance that Rob talked about in Civil and the performance in AECO, especially coming out the end of the year with really strong performance continuing into 2025.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.
Robert Mason : Yes, good morning Rob, Phil. So I appreciate all the level of detail to get us level set given all the moving pieces, adjusted numbers, pretty helpful. So just taking that you provided, it looks like within your segments, and I'll speak Field Systems, your margins are up about 100 basis points on kind of flat organic growth. And then in the Transportation business, margins kind of flat on high single-digit core growth. So can you bridge those two dynamics, if I'm interpreting that correctly? I would have thought Field Systems needed to absorb some channel investments, so that is probably a good outcome, but just the P&L margins being flat, is that the right interpretation?
Phil Sawarynski: Yes. So Rob, it's Phil. One at a time. So on the Field Systems, we talked about this before with some of the changes to the JV -- with the CAT JV. We've shifted some of the margins that were in our equity investment income line into the OpEx. So we sell product into the JV, and we changed some of the margins and pricing on that. And so that actually helps improve the margins in the Field Systems business. But some of that is actually offset by what you said, which was the investment in the channel build-out. And so we do get some upside there because of the economic shift. And then on the transportation business, I think the big item that is a headwind there is really the FX. So the Transporeon is all euro-denominated and is profitable. And so when we translate that back given the strong U.S. dollar, that actually creates a decent headwind for the transportation segment.
Robert Mason : So I think, $0.04 headwind you called out that's disproportionately in P&L then?
Phil Sawarynski : It is primarily T&L and AECO. AECO, given the growth and particularly in Europe, doesn't have a big footprint like we do in field systems. And so it is both Transportation and AECO. But yes, Transporeon because of the size of that and all euro-denominated, it is a big portion of it.
Robert Mason : Sure. And just as a quick follow-up. I think you touched on some of the geographic strength calling out in North America. But could you add a little color or context to what you are seeing in Asia Pac in Europe?
Rob Painter: Hi, Rob, this is Rob. Good morning. In what India -- India is doing especially well. I'd say that's the highlight in the region. I'd say the toughest market on the other book end, probably China and Japan, are challenged. Japan to -- the FX is particularly difficult in that market. And then in between, you are going to have Australia, New Zealand. But India does standout positive.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session, and that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Novi [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Painter, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which refer to the corresponding period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis which excludes our agriculture business. Let's start on Slide 4. During the third quarter, we continued to advance our Connect & Scale strategy. The Connect aspect of the strategy guides us to digitally connect users, data and workflows across stakeholders in the engineering and construction and transportation and logistics industries. The Scale aspect of the strategy guides us to develop increasingly common back-end systems and shared technology platforms while deploying more consistent processes around focused and accountable teams. Our strategy is working and it is delivering unique present and future value to our customers as well as sustainable value creation to our shareholders. In the quarter, we outperformed expectations at the top and bottom line and we are raising our top and bottom line guidance for the year. Congratulations and thank you to the entire Trimble team. The numbers reflect hard and intentional work in the quarter as well as over the last 4.5 years. Three messages to convey here. First, we delivered ARR of $2.187 billion in the quarter, up 14% organically. This kind of growth at scale doesn't happen without an enormous commitment to our Connect & Scale strategy. We also delivered a record gross margin of 68.5%. That compares to a gross margin of 57.7% in 2019. While the record numbers speak for themselves, it is important to recognize that this is a result of the journey we undertook a number of years ago and we are proud of our progress. Second, the structural improvement in the quality of the Trimble business model reflects focus and choice, choice manifests as disciplined capital allocation. In the last 4 years, we have divested 22 businesses. In September, we announced our intention to sell our mobility business to Platform Science and to become a major shareholder in the combined business. We are playing in the zones where we believe we have the strongest rate to win. As soon as we conclude the audit process with EY, we will return to share buyback as we believe this is a high return on investment use of shareholder capital at our current valuation. As a reminder, we have $625 million remaining under our current authorization. Finally, the sum of our efforts over the last year is manifesting as a more simplified Trimble, managed and led by a highly focused, engaged and hungry team. Moving to Slide 5, we cover the financial highlights from the quarter. 4% revenue growth exceeded our expectations, as did EBITDA at a strong 27.1% and EPS at $0.70 which performed above the high end of our guidance range. To give a quick snapshot of a few of these metrics without the mobility business, ARR would have grown 16% instead of 14% and revenue would have grown 5% instead of 4%. Before moving to comment on segment performance, I'll provide an update on the status of our financial audit procedures. During the August earnings call, I thought we were approximately a month or so away from being done. I was obviously wrong. In September, we held our Annual Shareholder Meeting, reflecting the progress made and the ongoing confidence we continue to have that our financial results will be the same as we previously reported. Since then, EY has continued to perform additional audit procedures. There is only one right answer. We work collaboratively to provide them the information they need. While our team and the EY team are making progress on completing the audit procedures, we now believe that EY will not complete their work in time for us to re-file our financial statements ahead of NASDAQ's November 11 deadline. Procedurally speaking, what will happen first is the formality of a notice from NASDAQ saying we are subject to delisting. We then communicate this via 8-K in a press release. After that, NASDAQ has a structured stay and appeals process for dealing with this exact topic. We feel confident that we are well positioned to be granted an extension which will provide EY additional time to complete their work and for us to file our financials, thereby regaining NASDAQ compliance. Let's now talk about the business, starting on Slide 7 with the AECO segment. Congratulations to the team for delivering another record quarter of ARR at $1.21 billion, higher than all but one of our industry peers. The team grew the business 18% organically which is at the high end of growth of our scaled industry peers. And they are doing this in a profitable manner, achieving over 29% operating income for the segment in the quarter. We look at Rule of 40 as an instructive measure where we sum ARR growth and operating margins. We are operating at a Rule of 47, delivering strong net retention and an attractive lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio. This provides us degrees of freedom on how we think about investing in the business to continue differentiating as we do with the breadth and depth of our offerings, including Trimble Construction One. Our portfolio is also quite balanced, with each component of AEC and O [ph], now operating above $200 million in ARR. I often describe this segment as the tip of the spear of our Connect & Scale strategy and the strategy is definitively working in AECO. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us, the results of today give me confidence in delivering the results of tomorrow. Let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about the Field Systems business. Revenue was in line with our expectations, down 2%. ARR outperformed, growing 19%, demonstrating the intentional work of the team to move more of our value to the software aspect of our systems to do so in the cloud and to monetize as a subscription offering. ARR growth came from strong sales of our Catalyst solution which delivers Positioning-as-a-Service, our Machine Control-as-a-Service offering and through ongoing growth in our traditional positioning services business. The team did this while delivering 33% operating income margin, demonstrating the ability to control cost in an unforgiving market environment. Strategically speaking, Digital Twins is a popular buzzword these days. In a Trimble context, I'd like to think we were the original digital twin company. The job of a surveying and mapping professional is to create a digital model of the physical earth. Our reach into the physical world, connected to our digital footprint and round trip back to the physical world is what is singularly unique about our company. In the quarter, we released a new solution to enable this workflow. I'm really excited about this launch. It's called Trimble Reality Capture Service. And what it does is link data captured in the field from terrestrial, mobile and aerial modalities, then links it to Trimble Connect which enables cloud-based visualization and collaboration at scale. We think this will prove to be one of those only Trimble innovations and we are excited to see how the market adopts this technology and guides us to develop it further. Another strategic milestone came in the form of the renewal and extension of our 20-plus year joint venture with Caterpillar. Slide 9 provides additional details on the renewal. The most important element to convey is our shared vision to accelerate innovation and customer adoption of mixed fleet machine control solutions and the construction ecosystem technology. For Trimble customers, the goal is simple, broader availability and access to our technology. Our recent partnership announcement with John Deere is evidence that we intend to achieve this goal. Also, our ability to link machine control solutions to Trimble Construction One offerings is another only Trimble proof point. Closing our segment commentary on Slide 10, Transportation & Logistics beat our top and bottom line expectations. Transporeon delivered double-digit ARR growth and MAPS delivered high single-digit ARR growth. Excluding the mobility business, organic ARR growth in the segment was 9%. Operating margins of 21% were the highest we have achieved in many years. While the freight recession persists, the Transporeon team delivered a record level of third quarter bookings which was also the second largest in the history of the business. In a dynamic macro environment, the team has done a great job with solid execution and an advantaged business translating into profitable growth and consistent share gains. Strategically speaking, the big news of the quarter was our announcement that we signed a deal to sell our mobility business to Platform Science and that we intend to become a major shareholder in the business. Further details are covered on Slide 11. For the combined business, this will create a scaled and focused software business that has a unique combined breadth of solutions needed to compete in the current environment. For Trimble, we will maintain a commercial relationship with the ongoing business. And at a company level, this enables us to further simplify and focus our attention and efforts in the areas where we have the most compelling right to win. Before handing over to Phil, in the last call, I talked about how I see Trimble as an AI winner. In the quarter, we continued to progress our AI efforts, both internally and externally facing. In this call, I'll end with a perspective on the macro environment. Geographically, the bookings we see are North America as the strongest market in Asia Pacific, excluding India, as the weakest market at the moment. By end markets, construction and transportation overall represent our book ends. Construction subsegments such as renewables, mega projects and infrastructure remain relatively strong. Residential remains challenged as do transportation end markets. In all environments, we anchor to our unique value proposition. What we sell enables work to be done better, faster, safer, cheaper and greener. The business is there, we need to be showing up in the right market segments with the right solutions and the right go-to-market motions. Phil, over to you.
Phil Sawarynski: Thank you, Rob. As noted before, my financial commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis which excludes our agriculture business but will still include the mobility business. We believe that maximizing long-term free cash flow drives shareholder value. Connect & Scale is our strategy which we believe will continue to deliver recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and ultimately, cumulative cash flow growth. Slide 12 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. Our cash flow continues to trend better than expected after considering M&A transaction impacts. 2024 year-to-date reported free cash flow was $389 million. That includes $87 million of tax payments related to our gain on sale of the agriculture business as well as $66 million in M&A-related transaction expenses. Our conversion ratio through the first 3 quarters of 2024 without these items was well above our target of 1x non-GAAP net income. We have additional tax payments impacting future operating cash flow related to the agriculture JV gain on sale in our fourth quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2025 since the tax payments are spread out over time. Our asset-light model continues with capital expenditures about 1% of revenue and negative net working capital. Net debt to EBITDA stands at less than 1x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.5x. We have just over $1 billion in cash after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. Our capital allocation focus remains the same where we invest and where we see opportunities for the highest returns. We continue to disproportionately allocate capital to our AECO business, where a significant percent of our operating expense increases are in our sales and marketing engines to continue to drive ARR and revenue growth and ultimately margin expansion and free cash flow generation. On the merger and acquisition front, we expect to opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions primarily in the AECO segment where we can quickly integrate and bundle within Trimble Construction One. Our 2 recent acquisitions in AECO continue to demonstrate that our M&A playbook is working. The human resources application we purchased about a year ago was quickly integrated into our Viewpoint ERP and we have already over tripled the ARR and almost quadrupled the customer accounts for the product in that first year. The payments application we purchased in the second quarter is ahead of our initial integration plans into the Viewpoint ERPs and we are seeing bookings well in excess of our deal models. These growth opportunities are enabled by our Connect & Scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. This playbook is a critical part of our acquisition strategy going forward. With that, let's turn to Slide 13 and talk about guidance for the remainder of the year. We have a 53rd week in fiscal 2024 which adds approximately $85 million of revenue and $50 million of operating income, mainly driven by term license renewals on January 1 which falls in the fourth quarter of this year. We are holding our ARR growth at 11% to 13% but are biased towards the higher end of the range with the AECO performance offset by the churn in our mobility business that we previously discussed. We are increasing the midpoint of our as-reported full year revenue guidance by $15 million from $3.63 billion to $3.645 billion. AECO revenue is slightly better than our prior guide due to the performance in the first 3 quarters. Field Systems revenue is also slightly up and transportation is unchanged. Correspondingly, the full year earnings per share midpoint is increasing by $0.09 to $2.83 from the prior $2.74. Our as-adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be between 27.5% and 27.8% which is approximately an 80-basis-point improvement at the midpoint from our prior guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is approximately 0.75x non-GAAP net income which includes $116 million of taxes from the gain on sale from the agriculture JV and as well as approximately $85 million in full year M&A costs. Without these items, we'd be above the 1x non-GAAP net income for the year and an improvement from the prior guide. Let's move to our fourth quarter on Slide 14 which is consistent with our prior guide. I will focus again on our as-adjusted view which excludes agriculture. Our outlook for ARR growth remained strong with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth with a bias to the higher end. Our total company revenue is projected to be $925 million to $965 million which includes approximately $85 million due to the 53rd week. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding the 53rd week, our revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 30% and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 30% to 31.5% for the fourth quarter. Our EPS forecast is in the range of $0.83 to $0.91. One more item I'd like to mention before turning it back over to Rob. As we think about the financial model going into 2025, it is critical to make the correct pro forma adjustments for the ag and mobility divestitures, along with the 53rd week. I'll point you to the earnings supplement on our Investor site where we consolidated the adjustments in one place. For 2025, we expect continued double-digit organic ARR growth. Starting from a baseline of pro forma 2024 revenue, we continue to believe that with the shift to higher-growth software, we are biased above the midpoint of the last Investor Day range of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth. We expect AECO to be above this range. Transportation is expected to be in this range after the divestiture of mobility which we are now expecting to close in the first quarter of 2025. We're expecting Field Systems to return to growth but be below this range. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Phil and thanks to all our Trimble colleagues and partners for delivering a solid quarter and a 2024 year-to-date of strategic and financial [indiscernible]. In the third quarter, we held our Signature User Conference in Las Vegas for a North American transportation business and our Signature User Conference for Transporeon in Vienna. We were able to see over 2,000 customers and partners with these 2 events. The overall feedback was positive on the mobility divestiture as well as the direction of travel of how Connect & Scale translates to digitize and connect the transportation supply chain. In less than 1 week, we will be back in Las Vegas at our Trimble Dimensions Engineering and Construction User Conference, where we will host over 6,000 attendees who are coming to learn how to further digitize and transform their work. In closing, we look forward to seeing many of you on December 10 in New York City at our Investor Day, where we will unpack our business and show you why we are so excited about our ability to win across our business lines with the right combination of products, people and go-to-market strategies. It's a busy and exciting time to be at Trimble. Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.
Kristen Owen: Congratulations on the nice results. I'm wondering, Rob, if we could start with just a little bit more color on the ACV bookings. What you're seeing in terms of cross-sell and upsell opportunities within the TC1 portfolio? And then I'll have a follow-up.
Rob Painter: Thanks for the question. ACV bookings across actually the entirety of the company were strong in the quarter. So we feel really good about that. That supports obviously, the ARR growth that we've already had and as well as the ARR guide that Phil took you through. Inside those ACV bookings, if we're looking inside the AECO business, TC1 was another highly successful quarter for that commercial offering and where we're doing the pre-packaged bundles. We see that the strong majority of our bookings, where we have TC1 available within AECO which is primarily within the engineering and construction applications, the strong majority are now TC1 bookings and those bookings are up more than the company average. And so within that, you have cross-sell and upsell happening. Similarly, in Transportation & Logistics segment, if we look at Transporeon on year-to-date, ACV bookings are up over 30% on a year-over-year basis. So a really nice progression from the teams in the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Rob, thank you for sharing the preliminary comments on '25, broadly in line with consensus top line expectations. What's interesting is given the trajectory you're on for ARR growth and what you just said about bookings, it feels like to get to the high end of your organic growth range, you would have to have hardware top line that's down high single digits. And so I'm wondering, can we just flush [ph] that out? Is that about what you're assuming? And is the idea, hey, look, there's uncertainty out there, let's make sure when we provide the initial '25 outlook comments, we have enough leeway in case end markets are softer? Or are there any discrete points that we should keep in mind relative to the outlook considering how strong momentum you have in ARR and bookings?
Phil Sawarynski: Jerry, it's Phil. Let me take that and then Rob can add if he needs to. It's a great question. I appreciate it. As we think about 2025, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, AECO above that range. Transportation in that range and remember, that's ex mobility. And then Field Systems being below that range. Now we still believe Field Systems will return to growth but it will be sort of low single-digit growth to get there. And a couple of the elements around Field Systems. So one is, we talked about the Fed this year. We believe the Fed business still will be down next year which provides a little bit of a headwind. The other piece of that, as we think about the CAT JV evolution, we are going to be part of the economics of that. We believe there are going to be some shift of the revenue to the factory fit. And so as we think about that long term, with the channel evolution that we talked about and going after the mixed fleets, call it, past 2025, we believe that, that will offset and more than offset any of the impacts on the factory fit. But for 2025, that revenue, there's a couple of points of headwind because of that. And then if I actually talk about the profit related to that, one of the other elements of the JV is we changed how we're pricing -- Trimble is pricing some of the products into the JV. And so what happens is, even though there's a couple of points of headwind on the revenue, there's additional profit that shifts from the JV to Trimble. And then if you net-net all of those puts and takes down to the EBITDA level, we believe that it's neutral for the rest of '24 and it's neutral for '25 on a profit standpoint. So that's a little bit more color, I guess, on the Field Systems. But we do see Field Systems growing, let's call it, low single digits next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.
Kristen Owen: Phil, just it does relate to the Caterpillar relationship and the Deere construction partnership announced in the quarter. Can you just help us understand with respect to the Deere partnership, what's covered under the scope of the agreement? How are you guys planning to go to market together? And I'd like to understand how you think about this partnership in the context of that long-standing relationship with Caterpillar? Any channel risk that you see with the Deere partnership there?
Rob Painter: Kristen, it's Rob. I'll take the question and thanks for the follow-up. I'll start with the lens of the customer on this. And both the Deere agreement and the CAT agreement help us grow the adoption of technology in the industry. And so what that means for a customer is that they're getting their choice of machine and technology and support to best fit their business. And that's both with John Deere and Caterpillar. And if you take John Deere specifically, what we're doing at the product level is enabling 3D upgrades on top of their platform, machine platform. At a go-to-market level, those upgrades can be enabled either through the John Deere dealer or through the Trimble network. At a competitive level or at a, let's call it, a channel -- potential channel complex level, I would characterize it as a no. We see it as complementary. And that's because we're not adequately serving that demand or that opportunity today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: My question, Rob, is maybe you could just give us a big picture take on where Transportation & Logistics stands with the subtraction of mobility? Does it change the Connect & Scale? Does it change what you're offering to customers? And then your Transporeon results continue to improve and be very impressive. I wonder if you can talk about anything you're doing aside from seeing a rebound to strategically grow that business?
Rob Painter: Thanks for the question, Rob. At a Connect & Scale level within Transportation & Logistics feel as good as ever about the opportunity and the evolution of the business and the business model and the opportunity. I mean, clearly, at a financial level to improve the metrics with a divestiture, I should say, mobility will improve the metrics, the growth and the profitability metrics and allow more, I call it, the goodness of the underlying portfolio to be seen. And I feel very good about the transaction that we're doing with Platform Science. I think together, this will be a scaled business that is well positioned to compete in today's marketplace. And we will have an ongoing commercial relationship. And to me, that's very important is that within that ongoing commercial relationship, call it, 2-way relationship, that ability to move data and to plug into our platform and our ecosystem, we think, can provide customers an ongoing differential level of outcomes. So good strategically, good at a capital allocation level, good at a focus level, helping us put more of our chips in the areas where we think we're best positioned to compete and where we have a right to win. From the Transporeon business specifically, both I'll call it at a product level or maybe call it strategic level across the whole portfolio, the teams have done a nice job bringing together some capabilities across both -- all of the businesses, both in the visibility side of things as well as in the freight marketplace. So like the moves the team are making to bring the businesses together, this is what we envisioned when we did the deal. And then in terms of the ongoing improvement in Transporeon I mean, hey, in the control that you can control aspect of things, bookings, to me, is the number one thing on my mind. Can't control the underlying freight market, especially in Europe which continues to be difficult. But we can control where we show up to compete. We are getting more than our fair share of wins with customers. These are some of the biggest logos in the world that we continue to win. I think the team is doing a really nice job. Those bookings wins up today, the nature of how bookings work in Transporeon as they do take a decent amount of time to actually come to full fruition. They ramp up, so they don't just flip the switch immediately because this is a consumption-based model in the form of primarily, I should say, 2/3 of the business models in the form of transactions on the marketplace. To see the real, say, improvement in the near term is in 2025, we need to see an improvement in the freight market to drive more transactions on the platform. A little bit cautious in Europe for 2025. So I would see that more as modest growth -- ongoing modest growth for Transporeon into 2025. And I think everything we've been doing this year and I think the team will continue to do in the fourth quarter into next year, will position that business to grow even faster coming out of next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes. I wanted to ask, Rob, the really interesting stats that you and Phil shared on the improved performance on the business you acquired within TC1 or the 2 businesses you acquired, can you just talk about your M&A pipeline as it stands today? What's the range of potential outcomes of how much capital we can deploy similar acquisitions that fit over the next 12 to 18 months based on what you see? And if you can touch on the valuation parameters on these last 2 deals, if you don't mind?
Rob Painter: Jerry, it's Rob. I'll start and Phil can fill in. Hey, at the M&A level, we do have a pipeline. Our priority is with the software acquisitions. Within software, we're primarily looking -- where we're looking first within the AECO segment which I think would not be a surprise. We think where we have opportunities to do tuck-in is that we can create high return on investment outcomes and that's clearly important from a capital allocation perspective at what we call dry powder perspective, we're sitting at Phil walk through about 0.8x net debt to EBITDA, we've got a target to be below 2.5x [ph]. So there's, call it, call it $1.5 billion firepower should we -- say, should we need it but I don't anticipate putting that kind of capital to work. We are thinking a lot as well about the buyback as a big commitment we made and we stand behind that commitment on the buyback, especially with where we see the stock price today. So that's a balance we have, Jerry, is on the buyback and the M&A. Expect more of the tuck-in type moves, I would say, at a divestiture level and we do not expect any additional major moves to happen on that front. Hopefully, that helps answer your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jason Celino: Just 2 for me. Field Systems, really nice beat. Maybe can you just unpack the strength there? Was it more on the public sector side? Or did you see any deals closed earlier than you had initially planned?
Rob Painter: Jason, it's Rob. Did you mean Field Systems or the AECO?
Jason Celino: Field Systems.
Rob Painter: Okay. So within Field Systems, actually, at the revenue level, we ended where we anticipated to be in the quarter in Field Systems. What we see that's driving the business, there's the new product we've got a set of new products that are coming out actually at dimensions. Next week, we'll be making a number of new announcements, both on the software and the hardware side of the business. So we continue to bring new products in geospatial or the survey market forward like the R980 that's improving the communications and the range on that. In the machine control market, it hits the civil construction. Our BX992 offering helps us reach a mid-tier market. And our correction services or with compositioning services business, a technology called IonoGuard is correcting for errors in the ionosphere. This is through the solar cycle that's been ongoing and that's helping to ensure the accuracy of those signals and those corrections that we provide our customers around the world. So, new product introduction is helping to drive the revenue. I'm especially pleased with the growth of the ARR in the segment in the quarter and that's coming from the machine control service as -- excuse me, offering-as-a-service. It's in our positioning services business where we continue to win new OEMs in the automotive market. And we literally sell positioning as a service with a product called Trimble Catalyst and are looking to do more bundling with the term licenses and the correction services that we have. So it's a good number of activities happening. The team is executing well in addition, at the go-to-market with our channel partners around the world. So, really a nice intersection with the product and the go-to-market and the business and then the team doing a nice job working the business models.
Jason Celino: Okay, great. Yes, I know the Field Systems there been accelerating nicely on organic level, so that explains it. Maybe just keeping on kind of the organic ARR theme. This is the second quarter in a row; we've seen 14% growth at a corporate level. I think you're still guiding to 11% to 13% organic for the full year. Maybe kind of maybe just walk us through the implied deceleration there, any conservatism you have?
Phil Sawarynski: Thanks, Jason. This is Phil. Yes, so if you remember, I mentioned this, we have the mobility headwind with a lot of the known churn that's going to happen at the end of this year. So my 2 comments were, one, I said 11% to 13% but biased toward the high end. We still see the continued strength in the AECO business. But where we're seeing some of the offset is that known churn around mobility in Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan.
Tami Zakaria: My first question is what's the conversation like among your customers post the Fed rate cuts? Do you feel a sense of optimism, could customer activity improve as we look to next year, meaning, could there be an acceleration in trends at some point next year? Any anecdotes you can share from last week cut cycles, whether you saw any acceleration maybe at a lag or anything to call out there? Or is rate cuts historically a factor for you at all. So just curious how you think about this transition.
Rob Painter: It's Rob and thanks for the question. Well, I have to say, we've depends on your time line of Fed rate cuts because we've been coming out of, I guess, a ZIRP environment, we've seen more Fed rate increases over the last few years and you've got to get the long baseline to go to go back to see an environment to anything like what we've been in that is to say, an inflationary environment that comes down. So it's hard to look back really in time and have anything that would, I think, be especially helpful. I would point out that what is so different about our business today compared to Trimble of the past is more than 75% software and more than 60% recurring. So we have a fundamentally different portfolio at such a higher degree of visibility into our business than we've ever had in the past. At the -- from what we hear and I would call it anecdotally is increased level of confidence and the confidence that turns into certainty, certainty can turn into ability to make the capital commitments. So I'd call that anecdotal. Of course, more than half of our business is outside the U.S., more than half of our hardware business is outside the U.S. And so we not only pay attention to the interest rate environment in the U.S. but globally as well. So, I think it's a little bit early to tell to say anything definitive other than to say anecdotally, we hear more confidence. And what if I think -- so one thing I am looking out for is -- and this is a North American example is, if you look at the bipartisan infrastructure law and you look at the amount of the money that's been deployed, only about 25%, plus or minus, of the funds have been deployed to date. So I call it good news in terms of the ongoing funding availability for the bipartisan infrastructure. And then, if you look at the cost of and let's take a U.S. example, every mile of road is about $1 million. And if you look then within each of the -- within that mile of road build, over $900,000 of that approximately is the raw materials, including the subsurface materials as well as the asphalt. The minority ends up being the machinery and the labor. And to the extent that inflation comes down on the materials, that's a good thing that if we can build more road with that. So that's half inflation coming down but I think that correlates to the interest rates coming down. So that's the kind of thing that we're paying attention to or the derivative -- second, third order derivative impacts.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That is very helpful. And second question, I'm actually looking forward to your Analyst Day but any early thoughts on how you're thinking about your long-term incremental margin target now that you have divested some of the hardware-centric low-margin businesses?
Phil Sawarynski: Tami, it's Phil. I can take that one. Yes. So obviously, we'll get into more detail at Investor Day but last earnings call -- I'll sort of reiterate what I said last earnings call which was we're biased -- as we think about the long-term model, we're biased above the midpoint of our prior Investor Day model which was 5% to 8%. So that sort of gives you the revenue number. As we continue to grow the software business disproportionate to the hardware business, you would expect the gross margin expansion. And then we talked about the operating leverage last time it being 30%, 35%. So we're biased towards the high end of that. And then if you put that all together with some expansion at the EBITDA level, we said over the time, we could expect probably 100 basis points of margin expansion. Again, that's over a multiyear view. But we can get into more details on the Investor Day as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler.
Clarke Jeffries: It's been pretty encouraging to see as adjusted margin expansion during this year expand from a range of 100 to 200 basis points now to 200 to 250. I wanted to specifically ask about the margin expansion we've seen this year in transportation. I was wondering how durable do you see that multi-hundred basis point margin expansion in Transportation & Logistics. I understand that with mobility, there will be a tailwind to margins next year but even kind of as adjusted, what -- how are you thinking about the underlying efficiency gains you can get in the transportation segment? And what kind of op income expansion could we expect on a go-forward basis?
Phil Sawarynski: Yes. So Clarke, this is Phil. Let me start and Rob can add any color. So as we think about -- as you said, as we got rid of or as we divested the mobility business going into 2025, that's been obviously a drag on our growth and our ARR growth this year. So we mentioned that before. So then when you have what's left is you've got the MAPS business which is performing well, continues to grow. I think we grew sort of high single digits ARR growth in Q3. Rob had already talked about the Transporeon business. And we're not forecasting right now for 2025 any meaningful change in the overall market. But he mentioned the bookings growth. And it's been a healthy business on our growth. It's been double digit, call it, revenue growth and accretive on the OI. So when you think about those businesses continuing to perform at that level, I would expect additional growth and margin expansion from those businesses as we go forward.
Clarke Jeffries: Perfect. And just one follow-up. Rob, you kind of given this interesting disclosure about how much ARR is split between the A, the E, the C and the O. When we think about the ability to sustain it seems like multiple years of 18% to 20% organic ARR growth, has the composition of that organic ARR growth has been fairly balanced over the years and you give these comments around 30% ACV growth in the E&C segment kind of driven by TC1 but are those segments kind of equally contributing over the years and that's kind of part of the confidence in AECO growth above the midpoint of the kind of organic growth range next year?
Rob Painter: It's a good question. I would say more -- there is a -- how do I say this; there's a variety of growth outcomes that we have within the A, the E, the C and the O. I wanted to point out that they're each above $200 million to point out the balance we have in it. So we don't have a dependent -- an overdependency on one aspect of the portfolio. And I think that's important message to get across and that was the intent of that. With the growth rates specifically, actually, our architecture and design business, kudos and shout out to the team for the last 3 to 4 years, let's say, well outgrown at an ARR growth level the rest of the of the portfolio. And we think it's probably the largest addressable market opportunity we have with the SketchUp product. We crossed the threshold last quarter of over 1 million paid subscribers using the technology. It's the one that's got the largest customer reach in the world for Trimble. So that aspect of -- or that part of the business is growing the fastest. I think it will probably still continue to grow the fastest for the next couple of years. I'd say the growth within the E and the C parts of AECO are pretty similar and I don't see that changing over time over the next couple of years, excuse me. And then the O, that -- sort of we call that the owner in the public sector. The public sector does grow at a lower rate than the private sector. We think one of the things that I think though tends to be quite attractive within the public sector is net retention tends to be high which is to say churn very low. So, gross retention tends to be the highest in that side of the business; so well balanced. Growth rates are differential but not enough, I think, to change our view here in the next couple of years of the growth opportunity for the business where we would see ARR continuing to grow in the teens.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.
Chad Dillard: So I wanted to go back to your early thoughts for '25. Just trying to understand like what sort of macro environment is embedded in that outlook? I guess more specifically, just thoughts on how you're thinking about construction and how it layers into your Field Systems guidance? And then secondly, I mean, it sounds like the AECO business is growing faster, the mobility side or the transportation side. And so like what does that mean for incremental margins or the gross margins in the '25 as well?
Rob Painter: Let me start with the macro and Phil can fill in some of the margin dynamics. And at a macro level, I wouldn't expect really any meaningful change from what we know now. I mean, after all, January 1 will just be the day after December 31. So it's hard for me to say that I see big, meaningful changes in the market. We've seen the North American economy stronger than the European economy. I would expect that to continue. We've seen subsegments such as data centers, renewable energy, onshoring of manufacturing to be strong and stronger than residential. If interest rates continue to come down, I think that could be a positive inflection to the residential end market. So we're paying attention to that because we know that that's underbuilt and that will come back over time. In the Field Systems side, we certainly look at what the OEMs are saying and they're projecting units down in construction and agriculture and that's incorporated into our thoughts on Field Systems. Now we still expect it to grow next year but to be below the company average on growth. And so that's taken into -- we're trying to take that into account. And transportation and the macros, I think that 2025 could start to look better for the macros in North America. There do appear to be some green shoots coming to get supply and demand and to better balance. In Europe, I would expect more of the same as a default thinking. So we're not expecting to see an inflection in -- meaningful inflection in the number of transactions per customer that would impact -- that would positively impact the Transporeon business were to be wrong in that and the economy were to be better. So some of those macro thoughts make it into the revenue, I don't know if we call it guidance yet but I'll call it revenue early revenue thoughts that Phil put forward. Phil, do you want to fill in the rest?
Phil Sawarynski: Yes. Thanks, Chad. So I'd say, again, we weren't -- this wasn't intended to be a guide -- a full guide for next year is just to give you a preview of how we're thinking about the year on a revenue basis. But I think you could roughly apply the construct that I talked about earlier around the growth and the gross margin expansion, the op leverage. And you can use the revenue growth rates that I alluded to which is AECO being the top transportation being in the range and Field Systems being lower and I think you can get to a rough model there. But certainly at Investor Day and as we go forward, we can give you more detailed view on that for 2025.
Rob Painter: And I also would -- this is Rob again. I point out that we have the earnings supplement. I'd encourage everyone to make sure you're looking through that because there are moving parts that we need to make sure that you're taking into account moving parts. One will be the mobility divestiture, assuming it happens which we assume in Q1. We've got the -- we'll have the agriculture that will lap in Q1, so thus, the as adjusted. And then the third big one is the 53rd week that we've got here in 2024. And so it's just -- it's really important to understand these pieces and work from the right baseline. Otherwise, it can look -- it will look off, especially with the 53rd week and the divestitures. And so we're thinking about it very much on an organic basis, excluding that 53rd week when we make this commentary.
Chad Dillard: Okay, that's super helpful. And then second question, I just want to get a better sense on the road map for rolling out the rest of TC1 from like, I guess, onto the owner side of the house and then also from a geographic standpoint. Where are you on that? When do you expect to see those -- that strategy kind of fully played out? And then how do you think about the incremental addressable market that you're able to reach from that?
Rob Painter: Chad, great question. Okay. So within AECO, the primary place where we're selling it today is with the E and the C part of the portfolio, where we sell to the engineering and construction customers, by the way, that could be mechanical, electrical, plumbing, steel, concrete contractors, the general contractors who do both vertical and horizontal work. Those are the primary customer set where we're selling it today. Anywhere where those customers can use architecture and design product, SketchUp we are selling it into those bundles. For our pure architects and only architects and only designers, they're not really buying TC1. They're buying -- they're just buying the product that they need Okay. So within the engineering and construction part of the AECO primarily, as you know, it's been already out in North America. TC1 is a framework commercial offering. We've got over 20 pre-packaged subofferings within that to target the personas. Then we're, I'd say, early in the European rollout and really not in Asia Pacific in a meaningful way, especially Southeast Asia, not in any meaningful way. I would anticipate next year that we really see Europe rolled out and I would say, probably partially so in Asia Pacific. We've got to have some of the underlying systems work done to help enable that which rolls out geographically. Then you asked about the O and bringing that owner in public sector into that and we'll start to see more of that next year. Now the owner and public sector actually already has its own form of TC1. We call it Trimble Unity where we brought together multiple capabilities we have around enterprise asset management and digital project delivery. And so that has come together in the form of a suite of technology to serve asset life cycle management which we think is actually super unique. So what we'll do is continue to pursue asset life cycle management within the owner and public sector, have the linkages to TC1. The extent of whether it is or isn't called TC1, I'm a bit indifferent, I'm more focused on we're delivering the outcomes to the customers. The other thing I'd want to take a chance to point out is, next year, you'll see, we'll see more linkages to the machine control and guidance market where we have an as-a-service offering, linking that into the TC1 bundles for civil contractors. And if you take a capability like we have with B2W, I think, estimating and tracking field progress for civil contractors, that makes a lot of sense to link to the construction ERP that civil contractors buy from us, to link that to the machine control and guidance that they can buy from us, to link that to the project management the in-product controls that they buy from us, not only to link the technology, to link the workflow. And these are the things that we can uniquely do at that intersection of the physical and the digital. So, I look forward to seeing more rollouts next year. When you ask about the addressable market, what we have seen consistently through the rollouts of the bundles that we are expanding the size of the addressable markets. We're expanding the reach we have in the customers as we move into more of an as-a-service offering.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research.
Arsenije Matovic: This is Arsenije Matovic on for Josh Tilton from Wolfe Research. Just first question, really great results in transportation and AECO, I guess, within transportation, record bookings and from Transporeon on despite the European freight rates. Can you maybe go into what's driving that? Is it better consumption than expected, better new logo wins with larger customers being added? And then moving on to AECO, within AECO TC1 specifically, what's going on there as well from a high level? Are there better expansions from existing customers? Are there new logo wins with improving win rates? Anything you can share there? And then, I just had a brief follow-up.
Rob Painter: This is Rob. I'll start within Transporeon. The bookings were the record bookings both for the both for the quarter. It was a record third quarter level of bookings. It was the second highest quarter ever bookings, put it more longitudinally to the year and about 30% increase year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. Those bookings are primarily coming from new logos and then increasing -- there's a land and expand play we have within the portfolio because there's a broad set of capabilities that the platform can deliver. And so that cross-sell of the rest of the capabilities is also driving a level of bookings. I'd say, in that business, I'm most pleased with the level of the new bookings and we were able to meet good number of existing as well as new logo customers at our User Conference just a few weeks ago in Vienna. And the customers are looking for -- both by the way the carriers and the shippers are looking for efficiencies that the platform can unlock. They're looking -- and we're seeing nice growth within the autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation product lines within the business. This is AI at work generating revenue and actually being monetized which I am really pleased to see. So we've got a differential set of products and capabilities and outcomes that we can deliver to the customers. We're primarily selling to the shippers. We bring them into the network and then they fulfill and execute through the carriers that are in the network. At the TC1 level, let me make sure I understood your question. Are you looking for color on what's driving that growth or what else we're doing within...
Arsenije Matovic: Exactly. Is the expansion? Is it new logo driven? Is there anything with better competitive wins with a more cautious budget environment for some competitors that are offering more expensive solutions, anything to get into there?
Rob Painter: Yes. So yes, let's start with the bookings. The bookings were right at or probably actually slightly above the level of the ARR growth in the quarter. That informs the view forward that Phil talked about in his prepared remarks. We have an enormous ability to cross-sell and upsell within the existing customer base that we have. And so that's where we do see the majority of the growth that we have in the business. And we are winning new logos. We have a differential offering. And the more we can link the bundles and the workflows together, we're seeing that generate new logo wins for us. The team has done just a really, I think, a terrific job throughout the year, actually throughout the last few years but let's just say, throughout the year to date, both at a product level, at go-to-market level and the underlying systems level. So at a product level, I think delivering -- defining and delivering the TC1 bundles, linking the workflow, establishing a marketplace where we can do integrations and have a sets of APIs to be able to integrate the technology that we have, defining the bundles. We're seeing good success when we have like ERP and project management, when we link ERP and estimating when, we link design and estimating. So we're following what the customers and the market are telling us to define the product set to take to market. At a go-to-market level, earlier in the year, we moved to a named account selling model and it's working. And then at a systems and process level, sales enablement, sales operations, getting 360-degree views of our customers, underlying marketing transformation to drive the pipeline. The pieces are coming together nicely in the business. And then linking that to one of the earlier questions, this is -- gives us the ability to take this across the rest of the world from what we've already been doing in North America and part of Europe fully into Europe and then into Asia Pacific.
Arsenije Matovic: Got it. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up. Is there any way you can provide more color on what changed from the last earnings call when you provided the expectation of completing the audit review in September? And is there anything, I guess, that you could share that would help investors better understand that timing change? Is there any new target, like could we expect maybe this to be completed before the Investor Day? Or just anything that you could provide additional color on there.
Phil Sawarynski: This is Phil. Let me start. So look, this is the number one priority for us. We're trying to work through this. E&Y has been performing incremental audit procedures. They're really focused on completing this but in a very thorough and detailed manner. And so I think back when we thought it was a few weeks away, we underestimated sort of just the breadth and depth of the audit as it went forward. So I think that was on us. But they're doing their work. The team is -- the Trimble team is very focused on this. We've put in outside resources throughout this process. But what I will reiterate is Rob's comment that throughout these many months, we pulled many, many data samples and we still have not seen anything that would indicate a restatement of any of our financial statements that to date, the financial statements that we filed, we believe are correct. So we're continuing to work hard with them. Again, we're trying to get this completed as soon as possible. But unfortunately, it's just one of those we, as Trimble can't control the time line. And so all we can do is put our heads down and work really hard and be very responsive to the UI requests and try to get this behind us as soon as we can.
Rob Painter: And I would think the answer is yes, we would anticipate having it done before Investor Day.
Arsenije Matovic: Got it. Thank you very much. Congrats on the results.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Trimble Second Quarter 2024 financial results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, Trimble President and CEO. Please go ahead.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business. Let's start on Slide 4. During the second quarter, we continued to advance our connect and scale strategy, which involves digitally connecting the workflows within targeted industry segments and creating scale across Trimble through shared technology platforms. Our strategy delivers outcomes in the form of unique value to our customers and sustainable value creation to our shareholders. We want to convey three key messages today; the strategy is working, the numbers reflect the execution, and the execution reflects our simplified and focused organization. Slides 5 and 6 detail some highlight metrics. $2.11 billion of ARR grew 14%. Revenue grew 1%. Gross margins were a record 66.5%. EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 24.6%, and free cash flow was strong. Revenue in the quarter was 75% software services recurring, and 60% overall recurring revenue, both records for Trimble, reflecting our portfolio transformation and continued organic mix shift driven by ARR growth. Based on the solid first half year performance, we are raising our guidance for the year. Before we turn to the performance of the segments, let me provide an update on the status of our financial audit. By way of reminder, the need for EY’s re-audit over 2023 financials stems from concerns about the comprehensiveness and documentation of a number of our internal controls, especially around our IT systems. These concerns arose as EY prepared for a PCAOB inspection of their audit of Trimble. In April, EY began additional audit procedures relating to our 2023 financial statements using a more detailed substantive approach. We are working collaboratively with EY, and provided them with the substantial majority of the information they need. EY’s work is nearing completion and we expect it to wrap up within the next month or so. To date, the audit has not identified any issues which would result in a change of our financial statements. When EY’s work is complete, we will reissue our annual report for 2023 and file Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarter of 2024. Based on the work to date, we anticipate that the financial results will be the same as what we have previously reported. Let's get back to the business with a review of our segment results, starting on slide seven with our AECO segment. The team delivered another record quarter of ARR, with a terrific 18% level of ARR growth. The AECO segment is the tip of the spear of our connect and scale strategy, and the strategy is working. We are succeeding in growing customer count with our innovative products and driving higher revenue per customer through our integrated platform offering. The A represents architecture and design. Here, our SketchUp product surpassed 1 million subscribers, an amazing milestone delivered by the team. The E represents engineering. An example of the strategy at work here comes in the form of unique workflows that only Trimble can deliver, such as scan, BIM, and fabrication workflows. The C represents construction. Here, our recent tuck-in acquisitions of field and payment solutions have shown us that we can run repeatable land and expand plays that deliver our customers fast time to value when they buy additional capabilities on top of our construction management system. The O represents the owners, both private and public sector. In May, we held a user conference in Cleveland where we launched Trimble Unity, a suite of asset lifecycle management solutions that uniquely connect Trimble capabilities. Across these AECO personas, we operate a common and connected data environment, namely Trimble Connect. Connect has now initiated more than 20 million projects since inception, and had over 6 billion API hits into the platform in just the first six months of 2024. On the go-to-market side, we moved the team to a named account selling model earlier this year, and we are now lining up our digital marketing efforts to better enable our sales motions. In conclusion, the connect and scale investments we have made over the last several years have enabled us to grow and gain share. Our strategy resonates with customers looking for strong ROIs. Based on our second quarter results, our pipeline, and our solid bookings performance, we see our momentum continuing. We recently hired a Chief Revenue Officer for this business, which we believe will help further enable and ensure our growth and success at scale in this $1.16 billion ARR business that is already operating well above a rule of 40 benchmark. The physical side of our business is largely conveyed in our field systems reporting segment, with key highlights on Slide 8. Revenue was down as expected, primarily related to the strength of prior year government-related sales. While in-market conditions have been soft in some areas, we continue to perform well, with strong product and channel positions. Nowhere is this more evident than in the more than $300 million of field systems ARR. The team has been doing a great job of converting relevant software and hardware models, where we have the ability to leverage our strong market position and product offerings to deliver unique value to customers. This motion has expanded our addressable market, as evidenced by delivering 17% ARR growth, nearly matching the growth in AECO. I'll illustrate this through three examples, starting with our Works Plus offering in civil construction, which offers machine control and guidance as a service. The team delivered a record quarter of bookings. Second, our Positioning Services business has expanded our unique ability to offer globally ubiquitous and high accuracy signals from our classic geospatial and agriculture markets into automotive markets. The team delivered three design wins in the quarter to major automotive OEMs. And third, we launched the R980 GNSS survey instrument in the quarter, with firmware configurations, field software, and Positioning Services available on a subscription basis, which expands the addressable market by lowering upfront costs, enabling more customers to adopt our premium solutions. Strategically speaking, most of the solutions we sell in this segment act as a data collection node in the physical world to provide us the unique Trimble ability to connect to the physical and digital world. Closing our segment commentary on Slide 9, transportation and logistics beat our top and bottom-line expectations. Transporeon delivered double-digit ARR growth, as did our maps business. Excluding the North America mobility business, organic ARR growth in this segment was 11%. While our mobility business has experienced the churn we anticipated, it is worth noting that the team delivered the largest bookings in the last few years in the quarter, which was one half a technology upgrade with Trimble, and one half a competitive displacement. Our new Instinct platform is generating positive buzz in the market, and we are having good success selling video solutions. While the freight market remains in a recessionary environment, our Transporeon business continued to win new logos in the quarter, and we continue to innovate on all our solutions, some of which will be unveiled at our user conferences in September. In addition, we are moving down the path of product rationalization between the Trimble and Transporeon businesses, as evidenced by consolidating our work on freight marketplace and visibility and to one team each. We also began selling our mapping solutions into the Transporeon customer base. The sum of these activities delivered 18.7% operating income, a solid 460 basis point increase. Before handing over to Phil to walk us through more of the numbers, I wanted to offer a perspective on why we see Trimble as an AI winner. Starting with our own internal usage, we now have over 2,500 engineers using GitHub Copilot and more than 5,000 Trimble colleagues using an internal version of Microsoft Azure OpenAI that we call Trimble Assistant. From a customer-facing perspective, we have beta and production releases of AI capabilities in a number of areas. In AECO, we automate the extraction of PDF data into submittal logs and into estimating engines. We also transform 3D BIM models into photorealistic renderings. In field systems, we focus on feature extraction from 3D point clouds. In transportation, our AI solutions include customer support, autonomous procurement, and autonomous quotation systems that match shippers with carriers. We've included several examples of Trimble AI in the appendix of the slides, complete with hyperlinks. Our thesis on AI is that the density of domain-specific data and insight will separate the AI winners and losers. With our unique scale that includes over $1 trillion of construction capital programs, tens of billions of dollars of freight transactions running through our systems, millions of global customers, and hundreds of thousands of instruments and machines in the physical world, we believe we have a compelling right to win and a defensible moat to continue building around our business. Phil?
Phil Sawarynski: Thank you, Rob. As noted before, my financial commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business. We believe that maximizing long-term free cash flow drives shareholder value. Connect and scale is our strategy, which we believe will continue to deliver recurring revenue growth, margin expansion, and ultimately cumulative cash flow growth. Slide 10 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. On cash flow, we are trending better than expected after considering the transaction-related impacts. Reported free cash flow in the first half of 2024 was $300 million, that includes $50 million of tax payments related to our gain on sale from the AG JV, as well as $54 million in M&A-related transaction expenses. Our conversion ratio in the first half of 2024 without these items was well above our target of 1x net income. We'll have additional tax payments impacting future operating cash flow related to the AG JV gain on sale in our third and fourth quarters of 2024 and second quarter of 2025, since the tax payments are spread out over time. Our asset-light model continues, with capital expenditures less than 2% of revenue and negative net working capital. Net debt to EBITDA after the close of the AG JV stands at less than 1x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.5x. We have just under $1 billion in cash after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. We intend to resume our share buyback when practical. Our capital allocation focus remains the same. We invest where we see opportunities for the highest returns. We continue to disproportionately allocate capital to our AECO business where the bulk of our operating expense increases are in our sales and marketing engines to continue to drive ARR, revenue growth, and ultimately margin expansion. On the M&A front, we expect to opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions primarily in the AECO segment where we can quickly integrate and bundle within Trimble Construction One. We acquired a field human resources application in the third quarter of 2023, and we also recently acquired a payments offering branded as Trimble Pay that has been integrated with Viewpoint, and for both, we are seeing bookings well in excess of our deal models. These growth opportunities are enabled by our connect and scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. This is a playbook that is delivering results and is a critical part of our acquisition strategy going forward. With that, let's turn to Slide 11 and talk about guidance for the remainder of the year. We have a 53rd week in fiscal 2024, which adds approximately $85 million of revenue and $50 million of operating income, mainly driven by term license renewals on January 1st, which falls in the fourth quarter of this year. We are increasing the midpoint of our as-reported full-year revenue guidance by $10 million from $3.62 billion to $3.63 billion, which also overcomes foreign currency headwinds. We are also increasing the full year earnings per share midpoint by $0.04 to $2.74 from the prior $2.70. AECO revenue is slightly better than our prior guide due to the first half performance and strong bookings in the prior quarters. Field systems revenue is down slightly, and transportation is unchanged. We maintain our strong ARR growth range from 11% to 13%, driven primarily by the expectation of mid to high teens growth in AECO, offset largely by the previously disclosed churn in our North American transportation mobility business. Our EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be between 26.7% and 27.2%. Free cash flow conversion for the year is updated to be approximately 0.75x net income, which includes $116 million of anticipated tax on gain from the JV I noted earlier, as well as approximately $75 million in full-year M&A costs. Without these items, we would be above 1x net income for the year, and an improvement from our prior guide. Let's move to our third quarter guidance on Slide 12, which is consistent with our prior guide. I'll focus again on our as-adjusted view, excluding agriculture. Our outlook for ARR growth remains strong, with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth despite the North American transportation mobility headwind I mentioned earlier. Our total company revenue is projected to be $840 million to $880 million. On an as-adjusted basis, our revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of flat to up 4% year-over-year, and is showing improvement relative to the second quarter, mainly due to strong government sales in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 24% to 25% for the third quarter. Our EPS forecast is in the range of $0.58 to $0.64, which is, again, consistent with our prior guide. I would also like to point out that we included a new supplement in our materials that is available on our Investor Relations website. This is to provide a summary of our results, along with assumptions behind our guidance model in a readily available format. One more item I'd like to mention before turning it back over to Rob. As we think about the financial model in a multi-year context, I refer to our Investor Day numbers from September 2022. Our long-term target model projected that revenue would grow in the 5% to 8% range organically. Normalizing for the benefit of the extra week in fiscal year 2024, we believe with the continued shift to higher growth software, we are biased above the midpoint of this range. We also had forecasted operating leverage in the range of 30% to 35%. Given the mix shift to software with higher gross margins, we would expect operating leverage going forward to be at or above the high end of this range. Thus, we see the potential to expand operating margins in the range of 100 basis points or more annually. We look forward to providing more details and an update on our long range financial plan at our Investor Day in New York City on December 10th. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Phil, and thank you to all our Trimble colleagues and partners for delivering a solid first half of the year and for demonstrating resilience and conviction as we continue to transform how we work so that we can transform how the world works. I'll end with a fun fact related to the games in Paris. Our technology was leveraged for the design, engineering, and construction of many of the stadiums, such as the aquatic center, the sailing marina, the football stadium, and also for athletic housing. The Les Gradins building, which houses over 400 athletes, will be converted to an office building after the games conclude. On the project, our survey kit, engineering, and prefabrication technologies, were used to construct a sustainable structure and to deliver it on time. Trimble Connect was used as a collaboration platform to coordinate across hundreds of users and stakeholders. To quote the BIM engineering manager on the project, I find Trimble Connect to be the best collaboration platform on the market in terms of file quality and usability. You can tell they designed the tool to be easy to use, even for non-experts. Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kristen Owen of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question, and congratulations on the nice quarter. I wanted to ask about the 18% AECO ARR, clearly ahead of our expectations. You lifted the guidance there, and when I look across the landscape of software categories in which you compete, it seems to me like maybe there's an opportunity for Trimble to pick up some share as we think about some of the pricing and channel shifts that we've seen. So, I'm just wondering if you can help us unpack the sources of growth there. Is it cross-sell, upsell, new logos, price, et cetera? Any additional color that you can provide there would be helpful.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Kristen, for the question and good morning. So, let's break down a little bit there within the ARR growth, starting with a congrats to the team. It really was a terrific post of a number for the quarter. About two thirds of that growth is coming from existing customers and one third from new logos. And so, we really - for the breadth and depth of the portfolio we have, there's a great ability for us to package cross-sell, upsell, and that comes in the form of the Trimble Construction One offering where we now have over 20 pre-packaged offerings to serve specific personas across the industry continuum. If we look at the segments that we're serving within construction, where we see strong growth are in data centers. We see the onshoring and reshoring of renewable energy work. These end markets have been strong, and private data centers have been the strongest. We actually have also had some growth in residential. So, even though there's weakness there, we've seen growth there. One thing that's unique too, Kristen, about the data set that we have, because we're managing over $1 trillion of committed construction programs through our systems, over $0.5 trillion through the ERP alone, is there's a lot of data we can see. And so, in North America, we can see that jobs are up. Hiring's up. That is jobs are up. We can see that the volumes are up. We can see geographic strengths within States here in the US. We can see that States like South Carolina, Florida, Texas, have been very strong. We can see states like New York and Louisiana have been weaker. So, we're able to get a good insight into the market. And then differentially across the world, North America for sure is performing better than Europe and Asia Pacific. So, hope that gives you some color.
Kristen Owen: Thanks for that. And my follow-up here, this is the first real conversation we've heard Trimble have about AI. You’re giving some of the examples at the back, which we'll have to go back and look into, but one of the questions that we've seen in AI on the market has been, how do you monetize it? So, can you help us understand whether it's the Copilot or utilization or the autonomous procurement? Just help us understand the value creation or monetization opportunity for Trimble in leveraging that technology. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Yes, it's a great question, Kristen. We're still in the very early innings of monetization. We're paying a lot of attention to it. Now, you talked about the GitHub Copilot work. That's internal productivity. So, the lens I have on this is, there's a set of work in AI that's for making us more efficient and productive inside our own house. That could be how we're doing customer support using the chat bots. It is the productivity through the code development. It's getting sharper about how we do our marketing efforts, leveraging AI when we go more customer-oriented, and those are the examples I had in the prepared remarks, and then we put a slide in the appendix with some hyperlinks so you can go look at some examples of what we're doing in the market. I'd give you sort of two breakdowns on that. One is that we see it as - some of this is part of continuous value delivery to our customers. That is, they're paying subscriptions. We typically get price increases every year. I think there's a reasonable expectation that we're providing incremental value. And in that sense, it's part of the offering that we do. The distinction I would make is when we have more breakthrough productivity or breakthrough value that we can provide customers, we think about, okay, what's the - quantifying that value and then what's our fair share of that capture? One example I can point out is in - within our Transporeon business, is the team has developed autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation capabilities. And when customers are using that instead of the traditional methods they've used and solutions they've used within Transporeon, we're monetizing that at I think of 2x to 3x (indiscernible) to 2x factor for execution because the result is that much better for the customers. So, that's one example of where we're monetizing, and I'd say we're still pretty early in it. And you're right that this is certainly evolving in the monetization side of things.
Kristen Owen: Thank you for the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino - KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Zane Meehan: Great. This is Zane Meehan on per Jason Celino this morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rob, first one for you. With the elections in the US coming up later this year, I'm just curious to hear if you're hearing any customers delaying buying decisions as a result of that, and if so, if that's contemplated in the 3Q and full-year guidance?
Rob Painter: Hey, thanks for the question. Relative to the election, I mean, you typically hear that in these periods, that people will do a bit of a pause to kind of see which way the wind's going to blow, and we'll see which way the wind blows. We believe we've taken that into account in the guide that we've put forward. And if you think about the guide, think about the visibility we have with the ARR business is much higher than we would have on let's say the hardware business, which manifests more as a book-and-burn. So, we have visibility into the rest of the year, differential visibility. 60% of our revenue is now recurring as a company. 75% of our revenue overall is software services and recurring. It's certainly reasonable for us to - and all of us, I guess, to think about what the impact of the election might be on our business, whether that's around regulation or whether that's around tariffs, depending on which way this goes. But we believe we've got this taken into account.
Zane Meehan: Okay, great. That's super helpful. Thanks. And then second question, Phil, for you. On the margin side, it's nice to see the little uptick in the guide. Just curious, is that coming more from the revenue outperformance or are you getting leverage from specific line item? Just curious to hear further info on the margin uptake.
Phil Sawarynski: Yes, thanks, Zane. Hey, the main reason for really the mix shift is our AECO business, continues to grow at a faster rate of the - than the field systems. And we have a little bit better first half and those bookings start to flow through in the second half. And so, I think what you're seeing is then that mix shift, which obviously the gross margin on the AECO business is higher than the field systems. And so, you're seeing that sort of flow through in the back half of the year.
Zane Meehan: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi good morning, everyone. Rob, nice to hear about the logo growth at Transporeon. Can you just expand on that? What was the logo growth in the quarter? What was the transaction count? Can you just expand more on the performance in the quarter and to the extent you have visibility on how the cadence looked into July and August for that business, please?
Rob Painter: Sure. Hey, let me frame this in two ways, one with the first half of the year, and then secondarily with the second quarter specifically. For the first half of the year, the bookings growth in the Transporeon business was in the mid to high teens. So, super pleased with that performance in context of what still is a freight recession. And so, the way then you can grow that bookings is coming through winning deals. And in the second quarter, the team won over 250 deals. Those deals come in the form of landing dozens of new logos and also doing land and expand plays within the existing customer base. There are certainly some pockets of end markets that are stronger and others that are weaker. There's been some strength coming back on the retail side. Some of the building materials have - that side of the business has been lower for the business. The team also had some success getting traction here in north America as well, which we were pleased by. And then last thing I'll comment on is we've got more plays happening between the Transporeon and Trimble Transportation business. Still early in that, but I like what I'm seeing in terms of the teams working together. So, add that up and that's the color around the numbers.
Jerry Revich: Super. Thank you. And can I ask a similar question for AECO. I mean, that business has been growing consistently around 17%, 18% really since you've acquired E-Builder and Viewpoint. Can you unpack the growth profile now? How much is the logo growth that we're seeing this year versus cross-selling, and how much runway do you see based on the pipeline and opportunity set to continue to deliver this pretty consistent level of growth that you've put on I think for about five years now?
Rob Painter: Sure, Jerry. So, the growth is about two thirds from existing customers and one third from new logo customers. And you're right, the team has consistently been posting excellent growth. And this is excellent growth at scale. I mean, AECO alone is a $1.16 billion ARR business today, growing ARR in the high teens, operating at a rule of 44 in the quarter. It was over rule of 50 in the first quarter. Net retention is about 108% in the business. So, a lot of good things happening in the business. We believe we're winning because we have a unique value proposition. The value proposition is delivering productivity, quality, safety, environmental sustainability to our customers. It's helping them solve higher order problems for customers and ability, especially when we have the TC - where we have the TC One offerings available. That's Trimble Construction One. It reduces friction in the buying process. It makes it easier for customers to do business with us. It's doing things with Trimble that you can uniquely do, that is connecting work in the field and work in the office. So, when we look at the base of the customers that we have, we're bullish in our ability to continue growing this business, especially when I look at that two-third, one-third split, and two thirds being from existing customers.
Jerry Revich: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hull of William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Hull: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of additional color on the go-to-market changes that you're making around the named account executives for Trimble Connect, and maybe help us understand how that could potentially drive faster adoption of the Trimble platform.
Rob Painter: Hi. Good morning, Jonathan. So, yes, we moved - in the AECO business, we moved to a named account selling model at the beginning of the year. It was definitely a huge change for the team and for the organization. And if you think about it, if you're going to - if you sort of rewind, call it five, 10 years ago, we might have sent multiple sellers in to talk to a given customer. Today, that moves to having one person who's got accountability for that account, and then accountability to bring in the specialist behind her or him in order to best serve that customer and meet the breadth of needs. Now, it's one thing to have named account model that would be incomplete if you didn't have the product to go along with it. And that's where the bundled offerings, TC - Trimble Construction One, namely arms those account executives with the ability to offer customers a unique value proposition. And then what's behind that are the underlying processes and systems. So, we've had a lot of, I'd say, growth around our sales operations, our sales enablement motions. And then with the systems underneath, the work and the investment we've made over these last years has, let's say, upped our game in terms of licensing and entitlement engines as an example. Then we're getting more 360-degree views of our customers, which helps - all of which helps enable the sellers to go do what they do at that named account level.
Jonathan Hull: Got it. And then just in terms of a follow-up, can you give us a little bit more color on the Trimble Pay or payments opportunity and how that works from a contractual or financial perspective? Just want to understand, are these gross grosser net type contracts, and what that cross-sell opportunity maybe looks like through your base. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Yes. So, we're bullish on land and expand plays within the platform that we're offering. So, when we can attach new capabilities to the existing base of solutions and customers that we have, we think that's a winning motion. And we've seen that with the two acquisitions that both Phil and I mentioned in the prepared remarks about work in the field and as well as payments. It stands to reason that payments are going to link to an ERP, and guess what, we have the ERP through the Viewpoint business. So, that's the essential, let's call it value proposition or essential linkage. We also have the project management systems, the need to be able to pay subcontractors as a given in the industry with a natural place for us to be, and we think a winning motion. Phil, is there anything else you want to add to that?
Phil Sawarynski: No, that was pretty good. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rob Mason of Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: Yes. morning Rob, and Phil. I wanted to see if I could get a little more color just what you're seeing across your various geographic regions, and if anything changed in the regions during the quarter. Your overall outlook, revenue outlook, we can see what that is. It didn't have a lot of movement. I'm just curious though how you're seeing the second half of the year as well in some of the regions.
Rob Painter: Yes, we're seeing the most strength in North America. Actually, Europe grew on an organic basis. That's going to be from the Transporeon business. Ex-Transporeon, it's been a tougher market in Europe, but I’d just say, it’s still holding up on a baseline. Differentially, around the world, Asia Pacific was hardest for us in the quarter, and I'd say think of a couple of places. China continues to be a harder place for us to do business. In Japan, the weakness of the yen makes it more expensive to do business with us, and those have been sort of a couple if pockets of weakness. We're paying attention to what's happening in Australia, New Zealand, the state of the economy there. So, the Asia Pacific, weaker. North America, the strongest. Those are the bookends. And that plays into our thinking in the second half of the year.
Rob Mason: Very good. Rob, you made note of some of the automotive OEM wins. We hadn't talked about that part of the business in a bit. I know historically there was some involvement with GM. Could you bring us up to date on where your book of business sits overall in that positioning part of the business, and how many OEMs are you working with now?
Rob Painter: Yes, good question, Rob. So, let's talk about the underlying technology itself. I mean, you go back for our 47-plus year history, started in positioning technologies. As positioning technologies have continued to evolve and innovate continuously over the years, we moved from, or we got into what's called RTK positioning decades ago, and now we can deliver those same - which deliver corrections to create that highly accurate ubiquitous fast convergence for that high accuracy need, which historically had been for us in agriculture, survey, construction markets. We can now deliver those through satellite, so you get more global ubiquity of the coverage of that. And then we asked ourselves the question of where else would this high convergence, high accuracy signals be of value? Automotive markets were a natural extension for us. So, same technology into a new market segment, whether that's for ADAS systems or on the path to autonomy or it's redundancy into other positioning technologies or sensors, I should say, on the cars. So, that's the context for it and for that market and extending the technology into the automotive market. And automotive is a market that we had - we do have some history in through navigation technologies. Now, you mentioned General Motors’ Super Cruise program. Yes, it's exactly the same topic that we're talking about with additional OEMs. I believe it's probably less than a dozen today that we have design wins with, and then there's certainly a pipeline that's bigger than that. When you think about the design win, it can take you a long time to get to that design win. Once you have the design win, you've got a pretty long lifecycle, actually, well, very - actually, I would say a very long lifecycle, multi-year call it plus or minus seven years over that design win. And if you kind of apply some software metrics to it and you think about the lens of lifetime value over customer acquisition costs, it's a good business to be in once you can win that OEM.
Rob Mason: If I could ask, how quickly do they convert to revenue? So, if your design wins in the quarter, when would you expect revenue?
Rob Painter: It's actually very slow to get to revenue. I mean, it's good news and bad news, bad news being it's very slow to get to being able to recognize that revenue. The good news is that we can recognize that revenue over a long period of time. So, I'd say to date over these last few years as we've been getting these design wins, it's had more cost associated with it than revenue and gross margins. So, it's been upside down for a few years. We're getting to a point of a cumulative base as we start to recognize that revenue. And it'll just - it will look better over the next few years as that cumulative base steps up, as it's the nature of the revenue recognition over multiple years. That 17% ARR growth in field systems has a little bit of that automotive segment, but that's not the fundamental thing yet that's growing it. And also, good news as I would say, that's the kind of visibility we can have years forward in field systems that we would've never had historically.
Rob Mason: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Tami Zakaria: Hey, good morning. Thank you so much for taking the questions. So, the first question is on the transportation segment. I think the performance was quite impressive given the tougher compare year-over-year. So, when I look at the first half performance, it's up pretty nicely, 3% to 4% year-over-year. So, your guide implies a zero - flat to low single-digit growth for the full year. So, which means sequentially you're expecting some slowdown. Should we think about this sequential slowdown in terms of the tougher year-over-year third quarter comp, or are you expecting any softening in the demand? So, just trying to understand how to think about the back half versus first half for the transportation and logistics segment.
Phil Sawarynski: Hey, Tammy, it's Phil. Thanks for the question. So, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but the - we've had some churn that we've already talked about in the North American mobility business, and that really starts to manifest itself in the second half. So, a big portion of the second half drop that you see is really due to that. But as Rob said earlier, we're still seeing the performance around the Transporeon business, the maps business that's offsetting some of that, but that's really the headwind that you see in the second half is that churn that we previously disclosed.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Thanks for the clarification. And then the other question is, I think you spoke of some incremental investments you're making in sales and marketing to support the software-centric businesses. Any updates on where you are in that process? Is it mostly done, or do you expect it to continue through the rest of the year? And more importantly, should we expect this to continue through next year as well? So, any color on that investment journey would be helpful.
Phil Sawarynski: Yes. Hey, Tammy, it's Phil again. So, yes, so as we talked about this from a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to pivot our resources toward the AECO business, and in particular that sales and marketing, which ultimately drives the ARR growth and the revenue growth in the future. And so, we see that continuing as long as we have the pipeline and the bookings. And the nice thing about rule of 40 plus business there is if we do see slowdowns, we can easily pivot our OpEx and still maintain a rule of 40. But as long as we continue to see the growth and the opportunities there in that business, I think you'll see us continue to allocate our resources toward that.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take the final question from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Arsenije Matovic: Hi, this is Arseni on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk directly, maybe a layer deeper into what you're seeing from a demand perspective across the AECO portfolio. Certain competitors in this space are facing challenges, and appears with one third new logo contribution to growth, this isn't really impacting your business. I know you sell a wide suite of products to different stakeholders, but are you seeing more demand than you saw starting this year, and is that driven by changing behavior in your existing customers, or are you seeing improving win rates versus competitors? And then just on Transporeon, with I think spot rates improving quarter-over-quarter in Europe and the Transporeon business getting more revenue per load in spot versus contract, is this providing a tailwind into full-year? And if so, is that embedded in your guidance release? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Hey, good morning, and thanks for the questions. I'll start with - this is Robert. I'll start with the AECO topic. So, yes, we have talked about the ARR growth, the two-third, one-third split coming from cross-sell versus the new logo. I think the additional color I can add to your question is as follows. We spend a lot of time segmenting the market, whether that's on the - I’ll call it the end markets, it could be residential, non-residential, infrastructure. It's also on the customer types. We think about where we serve the architects and designers, the engineers, the construction companies and the owners, their segmentation there. There's also a level of segmentation in terms of the size of the customer. So, think about mid-market customers, think about large enterprise customers, and then lower down, think about the small medium-sized businesses. One of the areas where we've been able to pivot is where we've seen a little bit more weakness on the mid-size customers. We pivoted our motions and our teams into the small and medium-sized business market here in North America. So, we've got the data and the ability and the products and the go-to-market model aligned to go find the business where it is. And I think that's one of the things that's differential about us. So, we have a broader product offering, serving the broader ecosystem, serving more participants in that, serving it more globally than our peers in the industry, and then being able to move our motions up or down market depending on where more of the activity is taking place. We also have a channel. We've had a channel at Trimble, I mean, Trimble's history. We've got decades of managing Trimbles. If we look in the AECO business, probably 10% to 15% of our bookings in the quarter came through our channel. So, that's also a motion that we've had for a long time. Oh, and on the Transporeon side, you asked about spot rates in Europe. They are, I would say just marginally better. They're not better enough to be really moving the needle yet. But you're right to look at that. We do as well, and we'll continue to pay attention to that. So, we believe that the current rates are built into our guide. If the market were to move quicker and spot rates go up, then that would be upside for us.
Arsenije Matovic: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Krista and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, President and Chief Executive Officer. Rob, you may begin your conference. 
Robert Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will primarily emphasize our as-adjusted numbers, which exclude our agriculture business, better reflecting Trimble on a go-forward basis.  
 Starting on Slide 4. During the first quarter, we continued to advance our Connect & Scale strategy, which involves digitally connecting workflows within targeted industry segments and creating scale across Trimble through shared technology platforms. Our strategy delivers outcomes in the form of unique value to our customers and sustainable value creation to our shareholders. We want to convey 3 key messages today, starting with a solid performance in the quarter, where all 3 segments performed ahead of expectations as detailed on Slides 5 and 6. $2.03 billion of ARR grew 13% organically, as-adjusted revenue grew 8% organically, as-adjusted gross margins were a record 67.5%, as-adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 290 basis points to 27.9% and free cash flow was strong at $227 million. We are confirming our previous total year guidance despite unfavorable currency moves and we will provide an update on our next call as we build confidence in the months ahead.  
 Key message #2 is a strategic portfolio highlight. In the first quarter, we divested certain water monitoring assets, our 21st divestiture in the last 4 years. And on April 1, we closed our PTx Trimble joint venture. I'm proud to have established this precision ag joint venture with Eric Hansotia and his team at AGCO. This is a high character team with a bold vision. These moves simplify and focus our organization and provide cash to strengthen our balance sheet and support our capital allocation strategy.  
 Key message #3 on Slide 7 is that our new reporting segments are in place, which align to our new organizational structure. We provided historical data on the segments to investors on April 12. It takes an enormous amount of work to affect change on this scale and I'm grateful to our Trimble colleagues for their courage and dedication. The sum of these actions will simplify and focus our business, thereby enabling us to reset to a new and better baseline as we aim to perform to our full potential. As evidenced on an as-reported basis, our first quarter revenue was 73% software, services and recurring and 58% recurring. While on an as-adjusted basis, our first quarter was 77% software, services and recurring and 63% recurring.  
 Turning to the segments. Let's start on Slide 8 with our AECO segment. Connect & Scale is well in motion here and it is working. Connect is about connecting users, data, stakeholders and workflow across the industry life cycle continuum. Our right to win starts with the breadth, depth and connectedness of our offerings. It bookends by delivering solutions that connect the physical and digital worlds. Scale is about making Trimble easier to do business with and enabling efficient and effective growth. In the quarter, we moved our go-to-market team to an account-based selling model. We expanded our prepackage to Trimble Construction One offerings and we released our next version of systems transformation, which is providing us new insights into our customers. 
 Mark Schwartz and his team delivered record first quarter bookings, an 18% increase in ARR and margin expansion of 430 basis points. This business is a multiyear overnight success. And we trust the new reporting structure now gives enhanced visibility to the quality of the business we have been transforming over the last few years.  To emphasize the point, this is a scaled $1.1 billion ARR segment operating as a Rule of 40 plus business, in fact, a Rule of 50 plus in the quarter. Market conditions remain favorable at the moment with strength in subsegments such as reshoring and onshoring of manufacturing, EV and battery plants, data centers and renewable energy projects. The physical side of our business is largely conveyed in our new Field Systems reporting segment with key highlights on Slide 9.  
 This business is predominantly hardware but that discrete word underplays the importance of this business to our strategy. Think of this as industrial IoT, the data collection node in the physical world that provides us the ability to connect the physical and digital worlds. In this business, we are continuing to transform our selling models, moving towards hybrid models where we increasingly monetize aspects of the solution as recurring revenue. Thus, the segment revenue splits approximately 50-50 as hardware and software. On an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business, Ron Bisio and his team grew revenue by 1%, while increasing operating margins by 250 basis points to 26.9%. Software, services and recurring revenue are 48% of business and ARR grew 14%, evidence of our Connect & Scale strategy in motion in this segment. 
 Market conditions remain mixed and overall slightly positive. We see strength in the same subsegments as AECO, including infrastructure spend. On the cautious side, we see economic weakness in pockets of Europe and Asia Pacific, most notably through lower OEM retail unit sales and continued weakness in residential construction. We are closely monitoring U.S. GDP growth, along with global interest rate dynamics and how that will impact capital purchases.  
 Closing our segment commentary on Slide 10. Transportation and Logistics began the year with a solid start. We closed the Transporeon acquisition last April. Thus, it is excluded from the organic comparison in the first quarter. On the heels of record fourth quarter bookings, the Transporeon team delivered a record first quarter bookings. Chris Keating and his team reorganized their go-to-market strategy and recommitted to process excellence and organizational focus. They are also delivering innovation, most notably through AI-driven product releases in autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation, which have found product market fit. 
 They predominantly deliver this bookings growth in a European region that continues to experience a freight recession, thus demonstrating that selling a winning value proposition and backing it up with innovation and process improvement can generate positive results even in a tough market environment. They also delivered a multi-hundred thousand dollar annualized contract value global cross-sell win, selling autonomous procurement to an existing enterprise software customer that is notably in North America. We've also begun cross-selling our map solutions into Transporeon's European customer base. We remain confident this is an exciting Trimble business with a compelling right to win and an attractive business model that enables a series of land and expand product-led growth opportunities.  
 In context of the bookings and ARR growth, we will continue to allocate capital to our go-to-market expansion. In the rest of the segment, the 4% organic revenue growth was driven by our Enterprise and Maps teams, which each grew double digit. Excluding Transporeon, we have delivered consistent margin expansion since the end of 2021. Including Transporeon the segment expanded margins by 480 basis points in the quarter.  
 Before I turn it over to Phil for his first call as our incoming CFO, let me once again express my gratitude to David Barnes for his service and partnership over these last few years. Phil, over to you. 
Phil Sawarynski: Thank you, Rob. We believe shareholder value is ultimately a function of maximizing long-term free cash flow. Connect & Scale is our engine, which in the mid to long term, aims to deliver cumulative recurring free cash flow.  
 Slide 11 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics in the quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, coming in at $227 million or 1.4x non-GAAP net income. We continue our asset-light model with capital expenditures less than 1% of revenue and negative working capital. Pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA after the close of the agriculture joint venture stands at about 1. Post the close of the AGCO transaction, at the beginning of the second quarter, we have just under $1 billion in cash even after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. Our strong cash balance puts us in a good position to resume our share buyback activity after we issue the 10-Q.  
 Now a few comments about capital allocation. Our priority remains the same, which is to invest back into our business where we see opportunities for the highest returns. For example, over the last few years, we have been investing in digital transformation, the fruits of which are being demonstrated in AECO. We continue to transform our processes and systems in AECO. And over time, we will expand this work throughout the rest of the company. As promised, we retired over $1 billion debt in early April. In January, we announced an $800 million share repurchase authorization. And in the first quarter, we executed $175 million of buybacks. 
 On the merger and acquisition front, we will opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions with a bias toward the AECO segment, where we can land and expand with capabilities that fit inside the Trimble Construction One offerings. As an example, we acquired [indiscernible] human resources application in the third quarter of 2023 and doubled the customer count in the first few months under our ownership. This was enabled by our Connect & Scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. We intend to run the same playbook as we think about our acquisition strategy going forward.  
 Before I turn to guidance, an update on the expected timing of the release of our 10-Q filing. Our auditors, EY, informed us several weeks ago that the 2023 audit of Trimble was selected as part of the PCAOB's inspection of EY's work. During preparation for the PCAOB review, EY concluded that neither EY nor Trimble had sufficient documentation related to certain IT and other controls for revenue-related systems and processes. While EY had deemed Trimble's controls over revenue effective at the time of the 10-K filing, EY's subsequent internal review over the last few weeks has changed their conclusion. Unfortunately, the result is that our 10-Q filing will be delayed and we will need to amend our 10-K to revise the internal control disclosures after the completion of EY's additional audit procedures. We have decided to delay our annual shareholders meeting until EY has completed their work. It is first and foremost, important to note and emphasize that our auditors have not withdrawn their 2023 financial audit opinion. We are committed to working with our auditors to close this out in an expeditious manner. 
 With that, let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. As Rob noted earlier, we are reaffirming all elements of our initial guidance for 2024 despite negative currency moves with some puts and takes between quarters and with prudence, given that we are still early in the year and our global end market environments are dynamic. Several factors influence our outlook for the year. While we got off to a very strong start in the first quarter, some of our outperformance came from hardware and term license revenue in the first quarter that we previously anticipated would come in the second quarter or later in the year. With this dynamic in mind, we think the best way to understand our trends is by looking at the year through a lens of first half versus second half. 
 Overall, our outlook for the first half remains consistent with what we shared with you a quarter ago. We expect that as-adjusted organic revenue growth in the second half of the year will be consistent with the first half after adjusting for the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter. 
 Let's now move to our detailed guidance on Slide 12. I will focus again on our as-adjusted view, excluding agriculture. Please note that we have also included slides in the appendix to our presentation that provide more information on our segment and corporate assumptions. Our prior guidance assumed the agriculture joint venture we closed on April 1, which is exactly what happened. The as-adjusted view removes agriculture in the historical periods, which enables looking at the growth dynamics of our current portfolio in a consistent way. Our outlook for ARR growth remained strong with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth for the year. This is driven primarily by the expectation of mid- to high-teens growth in AECO ARR. Our total company full year organic revenue growth outlook remains in the 4% to 7% range. This is driven by AECO growth in the high teens to low 20s, field systems growth flat to down in the low single digits transportation revenue flat to up in the low single digits. 
 As a reminder, our 2024 fiscal year includes 53 weeks, which increases full year and fourth quarter revenue by approximately $85 million of which approximately $70 million is in the AECO segment. Excluding this extra week revenue growth in AECO, is expected to be up in the low to mid-teens. Our margin outlook for the year is also unchanged with non-GAAP operating margin expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%. This represents year-over-year improvement on both measures of between 100 and 200 basis points. AECO margins are expected to be up approximately 300 basis points for the year and by about 50 basis points, excluding the extra week. This margin expansion reflects both the strong growth in our construction software businesses with high gross margins, while continuing to invest in support of future growth opportunities. 
 In Field Systems, margins are expected to be down approximately 100 basis points due to changes in customer and product mix.  Finally, in transportation, we expect margins to continue to improve with margins up approximately 100 basis points for the year with continued margin expansion in our Enterprise, Maps and Transporeon businesses. 
 Our EPS forecast of $2.60 to $2.80 is unchanged and continues to reflect the benefits of capital redeployment of the proceeds from the joint venture transaction. We've already paid down all of our prepayable debt and we continue to anticipate that we will execute on up to $800 million of share repurchases over the course of the year. Relative to our prior guidance, EPS will benefit from lower net interest expense due to the increased cash on our balance sheet, offset by lower equity income. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of approximately 0.85x non-GAAP net income. This outlook does not assume a change as it relates to expensing research and development for tax purposes. 
 Excluding the impact of acquisition deal expenses and the 53rd week, our free cash flow forecast for the year is roughly 1x non-GAAP net income. Note that we expect free cash flow in the second quarter to be the lowest of the year. Second quarter cash flow is normally seasonally low and in the second quarter, we will see high acquisition-related expenses related to the closing and transition costs for the agriculture joint venture as well as higher cash taxes. 
 I'll finish by offering a few comments on how our guidance for 2024 breaks out by quarter. As we discussed, our guidance overall assumes that excluding the 53rd week, our as-adjusted organic growth is relatively consistent between the first half and second half of the year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue between $845 million and $875 million, which reflects as-adjusted organic revenue approximately flat year-over-year. As-adjusted organic revenue growth year-over-year in all 3 segments is expected to be lower than the first quarter. In AECO, these dynamics reflect the timing of the term license sales which although considered as part of our ARR calculation, are recognized upfront under the accounting rules and positively impacted the segment in the first quarter. 
 To illustrate this point further, within AECO, we recognized approximately $85 million of term license revenue in the first quarter and in both the second quarter and third quarter, we expect term license revenue in AECO to be approximately $30 million, due in large part to the normal timing of the term license renewals. Then in the fourth quarter, that term license revenue will increase again above first quarter levels due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in January 1, 2025, in our 2024 fiscal year, which is when many of the term licenses renew. Our ARR measure evens out the lumpy nature of term license revenue and we believe it is the best measure of growth in AECO. It's important to note that term license revenue is highly profitable, so the profitability in our AECO segment and at the company level will be highest in the first quarter and fourth quarter and lower in the second and third quarters. 
 In the Field Systems segment, we had strong sales of geospatial technology to government customers in both the second quarter of 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, which we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. Transportation revenues and organic growth will be modestly lower in the second quarter, primarily reflecting reduced low-margin hardware sales in our North American mobility business. At this point, we expect the total company third quarter revenue will be similar to second quarter revenue with fourth quarter revenue, the high point for the year, assisted by $85 million in revenue from the 53rd week. Operating and EBITDA margins for the year are expected to follow these same trends. We look forward to providing you with more details on the drivers and economics of these segments at our Investor Day event in December. 
 Rob, I'll turn it back to you. 
Robert Painter: Thanks, Phil. When we think about our right to win at Trimble, we believe we can uniquely bring together users and connect workflow between the physical and digital worlds across industry continuums. Connect & Scale as our strategy, our strategy as an industry platform strategy, our platform strategy is in turn a data strategy. If we are successful in our pursuits, we will collect one of the most complete data sets in and across industries, creating a flywheel of enhanced insights and data connectivity, thereby enabling our customers to transform how they work while building a competitive moat around our business. Thanks to all our Trimble colleagues for delivering a solid start to the year and for demonstrating resilience and conviction as we continue to transform how we work so that we can transform how the world works. 
 Operator, we can now open the line to questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. 
Charles Albert Dillard: So I guess my first question, I just wanted to dig in more into the financial controls issue. I was hoping if you could give a little bit more detail on just, I guess, like what happened in terms of the IT and the impact on revenue recognition. And then, I guess, to what extent, at least right now, do you think this could potentially impact the income statement? And just like how are you thinking about the timing of resolution? 
Robert Painter: I'm going to turn it to David Barnes. David is staying on with us to see this through to its conclusion. And so David, why don't you? 
David Barnes: Chad, so the process is that our 10-K was filed, as you know, in February and the PCAOB selected EY's audit of Trimble for their review. And as the EY team looked over their work papers on the internal control side of things, they concluded the documentation that they and we had would -- was not sufficient to meet the standards of the audit of internal controls. And Chad, the thing I'd point out is the EY support of our financials is unchanged. This is just about the internal controls. No issues with our numbers have been identified by EY or us. What's happening is, EY is going to go through enhanced audit procedures to confirm the numbers and then we will issue an amended 10-K which will enable us to issue the 10-Q as well. This -- we've looked at -- companies have gone through this and it takes probably more than 1 month, hard to predict the timing. It's inconvenient but we, at this point, have no reason to believe that our numbers will change and we're working cooperatively with EY to get through it. 
Charles Albert Dillard: Great. That's helpful. And just moving to AECO. Can you give a little bit more detail on bookings for that business, like during the quarter? And if you can, just talk about what the take rate is on your bundled offering? 
Robert Painter: So bookings in the quarter continued to be strong. So put together really a couple of years now of strong progression in the bookings. The bookings -- the ACV bookings were over 20% growth in the quarter. So we like what we're seeing in terms of the progression there. Within that, Trimble Construction One is clearly an offering that we've been talking a lot about over the last, say, 1 year, 1.5 years. The bookings grew faster than that within Trimble Construction One. So Trimble Construction One, we're continuing to increase the level of adoption through that as we've transformed our selling organization and the processes and the systems to go along with that. So I'll give you an example, in North America, I think about 80% of our bookings were Trimble Construction One bookings within the quarter and those grew at a level of almost 2x the bookings level growth on a year-over-year basis. So strong progression, Chad. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc. 
Jason Celino: Maybe double clicking on that a little bit. When you think about the growth that you're seeing in AECO and maybe if you can go a step deeper on TC1? Is there a way to think about it versus net new versus expansion? 
Robert Painter: Jason, the breakdown on that is about 2/3, 1/3, 2/3 existing logos, 1/3 new logos. So if we take new logos, what we see is that the offering is expanding the addressable market. In some cases, that's allowing us to go, I'd say, more than the small, mid-sized end of the market with the offering. And then on the, let's call it, the mid- to upper end of the market, we continue to see customers wanting to buy into an ecosystem. We think that's driving a good amount of the growth. Team has done a great job executing. 
Jason Celino: Yes. I mean it seems like you're executing quite well. I know the demand environment doesn't make it easy. But maybe relative to 90 days ago, maybe can you just give us an update on how some of that end market or macro kind of sentiment is within that segment? 
Robert Painter: Yes, good question. So on the macro side within AECO, what I would comment on, is that we see good growth in onshoring, reshoring of manufacturing, we see -- and you see that in Europe and North America. Renewables, data centers, these are strong growers in North America and those bookings and ARR growth supports that. Residential, with interest rate environment is on the other side of that. Trade, that aspect of the market is a bit more challenged. We actually also, Jason, have quite a bit of data within our own systems. As you know, we're managing nearly 1/3 of U.S. construction through our systems. And so we can see that hiring is up in the market here in North America in the nonresidential space. We can see geographically that there's been the largest growth in the Midwest, followed by the Southeast with Florida, Carolinas and Georgia. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Just wanted to start with a little bit more of a high-level question. As we look at Trimble moving forward, just given the model and mix changes here, at what point should we expect ARR and total revenue growth to converge a little bit more? 
Robert Painter: Jonathan, it's Rob. Good question. We actually already see that in AECO. And so you can see the growth in the quarter, for example, was the 18% on the ARR as well as 18% revenue. If you look in transportation and logistics, you actually have the same phenomenon -- total revenue up for ARR up [ 4% ].  So it correlates to the amount of recurring, it's in that. The one that will be disconnected and would remain so for, I think, a number of years would be field systems, which is predominantly a hardware business. I think they recurring, as I recall it, in the 20% range on that. So those will remain separated and thus, leave a separation at the total company level. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And just as a follow-up, can you give us a little bit more detail on Transporeon and what maybe changed there to drive the much improved results? 
Robert Painter: Yes, a good question as well. So another strong quarter of bookings growth. That's 2 quarters in a row of records for the business, a record Q4 and then a record with the Q1 as well. What I would say is, there's a few things to add on to that. So the team began successfully cross-selling Transporeon solutions to existing Trimble Transportation customers here in North America, which exemplifies go-to-market synergies and we think we're just getting started. Conversely, we've been selling some of our maps solutions into the European market. Those bookings growth were both with the shippers and carrier customers. 
 And that's important because we continue -- the team is continuing to grow network participants on all sides of the transportation management platform, which effectively connects the buyers and the sellers of freight. Dozens of new logos were added in the quarter. I like what we're seeing from new products development as well with autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation. So I'd say a number of things coming together. The team is executing quite well in which is still a very difficult economic or difficult freight market economy, doubly so in Europe. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: Yes, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the 2Q margin outlook. So you folks had an outstanding first quarter and I understand the comments about the term license sales but historically, you just don't have the type of margin step down that you're guiding to 2Q versus 1Q. And so I just want to make sure we understand how much of that is, making sure that we can beat numbers like we did this quarter versus a meaningful slowdown in any part of the business because, obviously, the performance in the quarter was really strong. 
Phil Sawarynski: Jerry, it's Phil. And thanks and good question because I know there's a lot of moving parts in our outlook. So, yes, if you think about Q1, as I talked about the term licenses, are largely a Q1 dynamic and that's that $50 million drop from Q1 to Q2. So if you look at the margin basis, I think it's around 400 -- a little bit more than a 400-point drop. So the large part of that, I'll put it into actually 4 buckets, half of that or a little over half of that is because of the dynamic of the term license. If you remember, as the term licenses actually get recognized all upfront. So that's high-margin revenue. And then as you move into Q2, the other 2 pieces are, one, we have our merit raises that take effect in April. And so that's about 100 basis points and then another 100 basis points is some additional OpEx primarily around the AECO business and the sales and marketing and R&D spend that we're -- we've talked about incremental spend there to continue to drive that growth engine. So -- and then the remainder is the term license to bridge that 400 points. 
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then can I ask separately on the ARR, nice acceleration in performance in the quarter really across the segments. As we think about what the Transporeon rolling into the mix will look like and it feels like you're looking for an acceleration based on the outlook in Slide 15, across the segments, putting the pieces together across the whole company, could we see ARR accelerating on an organic basis in the mid- to high teens from an exit rate standpoint, beyond the full year guide. Just thinking about what 4Q might look like given the cadence that you described in the slides? 
Robert Painter: Well, so the Transporeon will certainly help them at the company level in terms of bringing up the ARR growth potential. The other side of that is the mobility business. And so the net of that gets to the guide that we put forward, Jerry. 
Jerry Revich: And Rob, is it fair to say that there's an acceleration though 4Q above the full year ARR guide? 
Robert Painter: At this point, no. No, we're maintaining the outlook on that. It has -- I mean, it would buy us more than above to the mid but we're going to leave that guide where we are right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. 
Kristen Owen: Rob, you called out the Rule of 40 balance for AECO. And I think just in this previous question had about 100 basis points going to reinvestment in that business. Just wondering if you can talk about sort of balancing that lifetime customer value versus your customer acquisition cost, how you think about investment versus growth to build out the opportunity set in that business? 
Robert Painter: Kristen, great question. Let me take that twofold. First, with the, call it, the 100 bps of investment -- OpEx investment into the AECO segment that Phil referenced. More than half of that is at the sales and marketing level. So that's putting feet on the street, sellers to go get the business that we think is there. About 1/4 of it is in R&D as we continue to drive connectivity and interoperability between the solutions driving workflow capabilities as well as AI investments we're making into the products. And then the remainder is in G&A, which is really the systems investments and the systems investments, which are enabling a lot of this to happen. 
 So then at the level when we think about the return on investment that we're making to put into the business, we look at that lifetime value over the customer acquisition cost. And the easy heuristic is, when we're at a ratio above 3, that's telling us to and lean forward and invest into the business. We're well above that as of, call it, as a floor of our thinking. And so when we do that math, this is -- actually, it's a pretty straightforward exercise to say we should be leaning into investing in this business to go after the market, especially when we're delivering well above the Rule of 40, and in fact, above Rule of 50 in the [Audio Gap]. 
Kristen Owen: Okay. That's helpful. When I think about the overall size of that market opportunity, I mean, we -- obviously, the business is going through a transformation at this point in time, TC1 really just starting to ramp. As we look at sort of the 5-year model for Trimble, how do you think about your mix of market opportunity for continuing growth in AECO. Is it within your existing customer base? Is it new products? Is it new logos? Just help us understand what sustains this growth on a go-forward basis? 
Robert Painter: Yes, it's a great question. So on a multiyear basis, I would frame this market as the largest available TAM that we have to service. We know the multitrillion dollar size of global construction. We're playing both in vertical construction, horizontal construction. We know it's a market that's large, global, underserved, underpenetrated, has challenges with productivity at the intersection of productivity and sustainability, which our solutions positively affect. We see more and more customers wanting to buy into ecosystems and our right to win, we think begins with the breadth and depth of solutions we have across the continuum of the life cycle. Furthermore, if you subscribe to a notion that the world is becoming more data-centric, more data-driven, then  you will like the touch points we have across this industry where we can, we believe, move from optimizing tasks to optimizing systems. 
 So we think we're well and uniquely positioned to do so. With respect to how we then think about existing versus new logos. Within the existing customer base we have, we think that there's hundreds of millions of dollars of untapped ARR to mine through cross-sell and upsell, given the breadth of that installed base that we have. With the systems investments that we're making, it becomes more efficient to go to market. Some of those investments are creating -- starting to create the ability for customers to self-provision licenses, more e-commerce capabilities are starting to come to market. That, in turn, creates a more efficient go-to-market motion into the smaller end of the market. And so that, we think, would be another TAM that we can unlock through the nature of the business model and the efficiency of which we go to market. 
 We for sure think that we can continue to win new logos along the way as customers and the market overall continues to adopt and continues to digitize. I would expect within that 5 years that the majority of that revenue would come through the existing base in this land and expand motion. So that's the expectation I'd want to set there. So continue to feel very, very positive about the work in this business and the progress that we're making and we'd like to think that we're just getting started. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. 
Justin Pellegrino: This is Justin Pellegrino on for Rob. I just wanted to look at the equipment side and what does a typical downside in the equipment side look like versus where we're at now? Are we most of the way into a normal downturn? Just any color there would be I think helpful. 
Robert Painter: Thanks for the question. Well, we certainly are following what the OEMs are reporting on their unit sales, both at a retail side and a wholesale demand level. And there's for sure a correlation within Field Systems business we have and the OEM. So we have OEM exposure let's say, in field systems that we really don't have nearly as much of in the other 2 segments of the business. What we would see through our own numbers is that the European economy is more challenged and we've seen some of the prints out there on units in, let's say, Europe, in construction, although interestingly enough, our Europe business in field systems performed quite well, relatively well in the first quarter. 
 So it's not a perfect, let's say, R-squared on that correlation. We're also fundamentally architected to serve the aftermarket and to serve the mixed fleet within that. So there's also another, I'd say, call it, the mindset that we have is not to be driven by what are new unit sales, although we do obviously sell on to new units as we see many, many hundreds of thousands of millions of machines that would benefit from having Trimble technology on and machine types like excavators remain low single-digit penetrated with technology. 
 And so we think there's enormous opportunities to drive technology adoption into the base of machines that are out there. That's just the civil construction side of the business. So in Field Systems, surveying and mapping is an important business for us and I would say we disconnect that from the unit sales coming out of the machinery manufacturers. And there, a surveyor fundamentally creates a digital model of the physical world, that work could be an oil and gas workflow, could be cadastral survey, could be in residential application. It could be in our national parks. There's a wide variety of applications in that market, which would be independent of machine units. I hope that helps provide some color. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. 
Robert Mason: Rob, you noted the Transporeon business had a win in North America. And I'm just curious, if I think about when you bought the business, I'm not sure that was, the thesis there was heavily predicated on North America penetration. But now that you've owned it for about 1 year, I'm just curious how you're sizing up the opportunity to bring Transporeon, at least parts of Transporeon to North America and perhaps any comment on any commercial efforts you have around that as well? 
Robert Painter: Rob, thanks for the question. You're right about the original thesis of it is, we didn't, let's say, create our model fundamentally around bringing the European applications into North America. We saw that as additive opportunities and we for sure saw that we could do it. We just didn't predicate the deal on that being the fundamental thesis. So yes, hey, good news or that's the, the example, the customer I talked about in the prepared remarks, it's a multi-hundred thousand dollar ARR win that we have. And it actually is using the autonomous quotation product that we talked about earlier as well. So not even, let's say, the -- let's call it, the older or existing application capabilities we had in the business, it's actually a new one and so we find that very interesting to think about. 
 What's most unique about what we have and special about the North America installed base, it's carrier-centric, is the nature of our customers. So when we look at capabilities to bring into North America on the carrier side, that would look like autonomous quotation and it's really creating automation around spot transactions. So that's something that makes sense for our sellers to be able to introduce to the existing customer base. In addition, we've talked before about Engage Lane in North America and the marketplace in Europe. We brought those organizations or those teams together into 1 team to create a global -- what's called global scale and global opportunity around that. So that's another example. And then the third example is real-time visibility. We're doing that as 1 business now, not separately in Europe and North America. And so that would -- those would be additional capabilities, then we want to penetrate here into the North America and yes. 
Robert Mason: Okay. Just as a follow-up. Again, as we get through this year, I guess we'll get recalibrated to the new -- the go-forward segments and the business without ag. But I was just curious in particular on the hardware and perpetual software gross margin trend. It's trended lower over the last 12 months. But my suspicion, ag had something to do with that. At 44% in the first quarter, how does that look on a go-forward basis without ag as we go through this year? 
Robert Painter: Yes, it's a good question, Rob, and Phil can chime in after I set this up. And you're right, there was an ag  [indiscernible] there in the numbers that you see. But in addition to that, we think about transitioning more of those hardware models into an element of recurring revenue. And that will naturally have a gross margin impact. So think about a system that might have sold for, let's call it, $40,000 system and that for us from a, I'll call it accounting perspective, has an element of hardware and software that's in that. And let's say that, that traditionally was splitting, we'd call it, $25,000 of hardware and $15,000 of software, so $40,000 sale. That might now convert to $25,000 and for the hardware upfront and a subscription of $5,000 a year. And in that case, that will have near-term headwinds to the gross margins. Now we're not flipping a switch and going 100% that direction, Rob. But you can see from the ARR growth that was 13% ARR growth in the first quarter, that it is a model that we are moving towards. So on a longer-term basis, that could be 200 to 300 basis points of a headwind. 
 Phil, do you want to add anything to that? 
Phil Sawarynski: No, I think that's right, Rob. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research. 
Joshua Tilton: Can you hear me? 
Robert Painter: Yes. 
Joshua Tilton: So just my first one is kind of a clarification. I appreciate all the color around the term impact to AECO. I guess what I'm trying to understand is because of 606  accounting, will there always be a term component in the AECO revenue line item each quarter, basically, every time you renew something or you can sign a new deal? And then my follow-up just as a clarification is, the reason why we have so much extra rev in the AECO segment because of the extra week because there's just a bunch of renewals that will have term licenses tied to those renewals that will land in the extra week of the year. Am I thinking about this correctly? 
Phil Sawarynski: Yes. Josh, it's Phil. So I'll answer -- your second question is the easy one. Yes, you are thinking about it correctly. Our 53rd week encompasses January 1, 2025 and a large portion of our term licenses renew around that date. And so you are correct in thinking that the 53rd week roughly $70 million of the $85 million there are the term licenses that renew. On your first question, yes, the -- there is an element of choice in this within AECO that we've had and we continue -- we'll continue to have that's largely in our structures business. And some of it has to do with the complexity and the horsepower around the offering itself where it's challenging to move that more into the cloud. So you will see that dynamic going forward, at least for the foreseeable future. 
Joshua Tilton: So just to be clear, term is not tied to all contracts in AECO, just some of them? 
Phil Sawarynski: Correct. It's a limited subset of the total AECO offerings. 
Joshua Tilton: Okay. Super helpful. And then I guess my follow-up on is just very high level. We've definitely had a lot of positive inbound since you guys have given this new segmentation. But I guess when you guys are sitting around the table right there, did anything change in terms of how you guys think about the business and plan about thinking about the business going forward that like aligns with this segmentation? Or is it kind of just business as usual for you guys there? And this segmentation is more for us investors better understand what's already been going on behind the scenes? 
Robert Painter: Josh, it's Rob. I'll take this one. I think it's a really good question. It's not just business as usual. It really does change how we're thinking about the business, how we're running it in some of -- at least the value creation opportunities that this unlocks. This does simplify and focus the company and I think provides a great new baseline for us as we move forward in executing the strategy. If we look at the AECO assets in that segment as an example, this is a business that is now operating at over $1 billion in ARR. It's a scaled ARR software business. This mandate in the business enables the team to take, let's say, the processes and the systems capabilities across a broader swath of the business than what we were doing previously. 
 If I look within Field Systems, as an example, there, this is the first time in decades that we've had our survey business and our civil construction business under 1 leadership. That is providing a sharper focus and frankly, a level of accountability to sharing R&D capabilities, being more thoughtful about our positioning technologies and how we're using them across the business. It's driving better outcomes in terms of attaching things like our positioning services business to the hardware that we sell in survey and civil construction. And then super importantly, at a go-to-market level, the similar competency within this is selling, simply put, selling hardware through a global dealer channel. So we're bringing more efficiency in how we go to market. That is to say, we have 1 leader in Asia Pacific, 1 in the European region and 1 in the Americas. So 3 leaders from these regions overseeing the scope of what we do in survey and civil. Previously, that would have been 6 people instead of 3. 
 So that, for us, is providing better and more consistent management at the dealers and then it enables a different way to think about capital allocation where we can put some of those resources and to help the dealers plan their long-term business health and their strategies to complement the work they're doing in the short term to help them identify the market opportunities and make the number. Transportation arguably had the least amount of change and there, it would feel probably a bit more like business as usual. 
Joshua Tilton: Super helpful. I guess just last one to kind of tie that all together. As investors, we see this change -- we see the change in the segmentation. You told us how it's -- it's definitely not business as usual. There are new and exciting things going on. Like what are we going to see in 12 months? Maybe 12 months is too soon, over the 3-year time frame, like what should investors be judging you on looking at you at, to say, this metric was this much better because of all the changes we made. Like where are we going to see all the positivity that you talked to come through in the numbers? 
Robert Painter: Yes. No, I like the question. And I used the words in the prepared remarks about a multiyear overnight success. This journey is 1,000 little steps. We launched Connect & Scale of January 2020. I think what we have now creates a new baseline. But let's also look at the facts in -- the fact base, I should say. In 2018, we had $1.1 billion of ARR. We closed Q1 at $2.03 billion of ARR. In 2018, we were 31% recurring revenue as a business, as-adjusted in Q1 were 63% ARR. We had EBITDA of 22.6% in 2018. We closed Q1 at 27.9%. Structurally, our gross margins in 2018 were 58% in Q1, adjusted to 67.5%. Over the last 5 years, we produced 44% operating leverage. 
 We haven't just decided that this is the direction that we're going. We've been working on this for a number of years. So now as we take this as the baseline, I think one of the probably one of the better things that as an outcome of the resegmentation is that transparency and that visibility to the investment community, which is what you're highlighting. It is very obvious to see in that AECO business now. This is a scaled ARR business operating well above Rule of 40, growing ARR in the high teens, produced 37.4% operating income in the first quarter. I'm emphatically positive and proud of the team and what they've accomplished on that. 
 So I look forward in the 3-year time frame, we're looking -- we talk about ARR and free cash flow. To me, those are the big bookends, not the only bookends but they're 2 of the biggest bookends that we have to drive value. So I'd say in the 3-year time frame, you should be looking for continued ARR growth. We should be able to continue to progress the structural gross margins, as software I would expect, would outgrow hardware over that time frame. The structural gross margin improvement is an enabler of an ability to drive operating leverage. We drive operating leverage, that means we're driving increased levels of EBITDA. And then as Phil said in his prepared remarks, I think cumulative free cash flow is the game in the long-term game. And so we'd be looking to continue to progress the free cash flow in the business relative to the net income that we have. That's the quantitative framework I'd have around that. Hope that helps. 
Joshua Tilton: It definitely did. Sounds fired up. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. 
Tami Zakaria: So my -- I have a follow-up on the Transporeon comment. The autonomous port solution you sold to a North American customer, can the same salesperson currently selling the existing Trimble solution, sell the new Transporeon solution to the customer? Basically, I'm trying to understand how does the back end of all of this work in terms of the customer rep for each of the 2 solutions, the billing, et cetera. And then how did the ACV go up after selling this versus what it was before? 
Robert Painter: This is Rob. I'll take that one. So it was a -- it's a multi-hundred thousand dollar ARR, it's over $400,000 ARR in that example that I used, so therefore, the ACV is over the $400,000 -- yes, $400,000 as well. In terms of the go-to-market motion, it's the -- think of it as a named account seller who is responsible for the account in North America, bringing in a sales engineer or sales specialist from Transporeon, who knows the depth of the functionality to be able to, I'd say, be conversant with the customer and the value proposition and how to use it. And that's actually very similar, Tami, to Trimble Construction One when we're selling a breadth of offerings, we'll often have what we -- now we do have named account sellers. And then we can bring in the specialists -- technical specialist to really know the depth of a given solution to make sure that customer can get the most value out of that. Did that answer your question? 
Tami Zakaria: Yes, it does. So the second question, after this formation of PTx Trimble, how do you view the organic growth algo potential of this new streamlined portfolio that you have? Basically, I'm curious to know whether you think it's now the right time to refresh the 2027 target. 
Robert Painter: Okay. So hey, on the -- what's the multiyear targets, we're going to have an Investor Day in December. And Phil mentioned that in his prepared remarks. I think we have been saying second half of the year but we're narrowing that to December. So that's the formal update. I appreciate that in the interim there will be questions of how do we think about that progression of the business and the model. And I think that we can continue to provide color in the next couple of calls. But what we already know is the baseline and I want to highlight that. We know we have a baseline from the quarter on -- or you can actually say, take the year, where we're guiding at the -- for the level of EBITDA for the company between 26.5% and 27.5%. We've talked about the ARR growth. They're guiding 11% to 13% organic. 
 So if you apply the -- if you take the EBITDA that we have and you continue to play forward the growth we expect and apply operating leverage on that, it's not that hard to see that we could [Audio Gap] of gross margin improvement a year. [Audio Gap] And if that plays through, then you can get to a 2027 in a plus or minus frame and then we'll put the finer points and the details around that in -- sorry, in December for 2027 or wherever we decide to set the next multiyear mark. 
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-12 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble, you may begin your conference.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before we get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Strategic progression takes place as a series of a thousand little steps, periodically punctuated by non-linear moves and events. Reflecting on the quarter and the year, 2023 represented a transformative year for Trimble. Within the portfolio, the Transporeon acquisition and the announcement of the agriculture joint venture with AGCO represent two of the larger moves in the history of our company. Reflecting on our Connect & Scale strategy over a five-year timeframe, the structural improvement in the business is self-evident and is the result of methodical work over the last few years by our colleagues and partners. Annualized recurring revenue finished 2023 at a record $1.98 billion, up 13% organically, and represents the single biggest lever we have to increase shareholder value. This compares with ARR of $1.1 billion five years ago. Recurring revenue was 49% of our total revenue in 2023 and 53% in the fourth quarter versus 31% in 2018. Remaining performance obligations closed the year at $1.8 billion. Gross margin closed at a record 64.7% in 2023, up 470 basis points over 2022. This compares to 58% five years ago. This is definitive structural improvement. EBITDA margin closed at a record 26.6% for the year. In dollars, we crossed the threshold of $1 billion of EBITDA. This compares to EBITDA of 22.6% five years ago. Operating leverage has been 44% over a five-year timeframe. We are running with negative working capital, and we closed with free cash flow of $555 million, up 60% over prior year. Our ARR and low capital intensity punctuate the difference between industrial technology and industrial. While the evolution of our financial metrics during our transformation have been compelling, the bigger takeaway is how this positions the company today for success now and in the future. Trimble has never been in a better position to help our customers succeed with solutions that address the growing intersection of the physical and digital worlds. We are eager to leverage our strong market position and unique assets to drive continued profitable growth in software and technology-enabled services, to expand margins and to showcase our ability to increase the company's overall returns through smart capital allocation. We believe this framework is the winning formula for a world-class industrial technology company, and we believe executing against this plan will allow Trimble to unlock and sustainably compound value for shareholders. With that structural context, let's turn to Slide 3 and talk about our three-fold framework that guides our capital allocation priorities looking back on 2023 and forward into 2024. First, we remain committed to executing our Connect & Scale strategy. Over the last several years, our P&L investments have been heavily biased towards our software assets in architecture, engineering, construction and owners, which we refer to as AECO. This focus is driven by the size and immediacy of the secular opportunity. Our transformation of AECO software represents the tip of the spear for the company and increasingly provides a template for how we will operate across all of Trimble. Looking at tactical proof points of progression, let's start with our product strategy. Trimble Construction One, or TC1, can be thought of as a commercial framework around pre-packaged bundled offerings. In the fourth quarter, we doubled the number of these pre-packaged offerings by serving more users across more vertical segments. Nearly half of our AECO bookings in the fourth quarter were TC1 bookings. We come into 2024 with a strong portfolio, and we will learn, adapt and expand these offerings. As we connect more of our data and workflows, we will continue to expand these offerings, powered by the investments we have been making in our underlying systems and enhanced by our process transformation. After a couple of years of hard work, we can now see a 360-degree view of our customer set, which unlocks marketing and selling insights to enhance our go-to-market motion with more advanced marketing and selling strategies that are more efficient and cost effective. We will continue to roll-out functionality in 2024 and we will expand the capabilities across more geographies and more of the product portfolio. And it goes further, because product, systems and process work have to link to an aligned go-to-market organization in order to turn possibility into a reality. As measured by cross-sell activity, more than 20% of 2023 annualized contract value, or ACV, bookings in AECO were cross-sell bookings. In the fourth quarter, this number accelerated to over 25%. This didn't happen by accident. The acceleration comes from a packaging of solutions across business lines and is enabled by our digital transformation. We are winning on the breadth of capability. To put this into further context, the AECO teams delivered over 30% ACV bookings growth in 2023 and had a record fourth quarter. Slide 4 shows a number of quotes from our customers, who've continued to give us positive feedback about our direction. We are delivering lifecycle value and uniquely connecting workflows, all while making ourselves easier to do business with. As we come into 2024, we are moving towards an account-based selling model, which will further align ourselves to sell TC1 and cross-sell offerings. This capital allocation is working, and is built on our strategy around the construction continuum that has been accelerated by successful M&A over the last 10 years. Back to Slide 3, the second of our three capital allocation priorities is to further simplify and focus our business. In the last four years, we have divested 21 businesses that did not meet the must-have threshold of a connect and scale business, namely the ability to further a connected industry solution while delivering compelling and sustainable financial results. In early 2024, we divested a small water metering business and a steeler business that we owned in Germany. We continue to look for areas where we can further simplify our portfolio, which goes beyond divestitures. We have reduced thousands of SKUs in the last couple of years and turned a number of standalone products into features within larger bundled solutions. In September, we announced our joint venture with AGCO, which naturally led us to rethink how we organize ourselves, which in turn unlocked an ability for us to further simplify and focus our teams. In the second half of 2023, we undertook $50 million of run rate cost reductions, $10 million ahead of our commitment in November, recognizing that we needed to say no to more things so that we could further focus on the organization. Given the pending AGCO JV and the new organizational structure that officially went into effect in January, we reorganized the business under three pillars: AECO, Field Systems and Transportation and Logistics. This structure brings similar businesses together, enhancing our ability to achieve scale and growth. The new organization in place is already off to a good start, and hats off to the team for executing these changes seamlessly. Beginning with the first quarter, we will naturally re-segment our reporting results to reflect the way we view our business. And when we do this, we will simultaneously be able to deliver an increased level of clarity on our business models that many of you have been seeking. Slide 5 provides an overview of the direction we are going with these three segments, while providing a bit of color on the software and recurring revenue centricity of each segment. Returning again to Slide 3, let's talk about the third of our three capital allocation priorities, which is return the capital to shareholders. In September, when we announced the JV, we communicated our plan to pay down debt and return capital to shareholders via a buyback. In the fourth quarter, we executed $100 million of buyback. On January 30, our Board approved a new buyback authorization of $800 million, replacing the remaining authority under the prior plan. We reiterated our intention to pay down $1.1 billion of debt and communicated that our near-term intentions on M&A are to focus on tuck-in opportunities. These capital allocation priorities sit against the backdrop of our day-to-day execution. They also sit within a context of what we are seeing in our end markets across the global economy. Geographically speaking, North America has been overall healthy. Europe remains quite challenged. The agriculture and transportation markets face macro headwinds, a result of commodity prices and overcapacity in trucking. The engineering and construction markets have proved to be more resilient, with puts and takes across sub-segments. Control what we control is the operating theme in place. We deliver an enduring value proposition in the form of productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. Record bookings in parts of the business such as AECO software and Transporeon, demonstrate the durability of the business. David, over to you.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Slides 6, 7 and 8 cover the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. Organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was plus 3% and for the year was plus 1%. Excluding the agriculture business, growth was 6% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the year. Standout metrics for 2023 include a 470 basis point improvement in gross margin and $555 million in free cash flow, enabled by profit growth and the success of our efforts to bring inventory levels down. With net debt at $2.8 billion, we remain ahead of the deleverage plan we put in place at the time of the Transporeon acquisition. We have paid down $268 million of the debt incurred to finance the deal. We ended the year with net leverage of 2.8 times, only modestly above our long-range target of 2.5 times. The JV with AGCO is pending regulatory approval, and we continue to expect that the transaction will close in the first half of this year. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that the deal closes early in the second quarter. With debt paydown following the AGCO JV transaction close, our leverage will be below 2 times. Slide 9 covers revenue trends by geography and business model. $1.98 billion of ARR is the standout highlight, up 24% year-on-year and up 13% on an organic basis. Product revenues, which are non-recurring and predominantly our bundled hardware and perpetual software, were down 3% year-on-year. Excluding agriculture, product revenues were down less than 1%, reflecting the stabilization of these businesses now that dealer inventories have come well down from their peak in early 2022. Dealer inventories are now broadly in line with dealers' business outlook, and our sales trends going forward are expected to track underlying demand trends. By geography, growth in North America reflects the relative strength that Rob referenced earlier. APAC revenues were strong, driven by growth in Australia and India. Revenues were down organically in Europe, reflecting challenging macroeconomic conditions across many the end markets we serve there. Slide 10 breaks down performance at the segment level. In Buildings and Infrastructure, the highlight in the quarter was the strong performance of our recurring revenue offerings. Bookings in our AECO software businesses increased over 30% year-on-year, driven in part by the strong cross-sell and TC1 performance, which Rob mentioned earlier. Aided by the bookings performance, segment ARR grew year-on-year by just under 20%, with net retention over 110%, and at the highest levels this business has seen. Segment revenues of non-recurring offerings, principally machine control for civil construction customers, were relatively flat year-on-year, resulting in total segment revenue up organically by 10%. Segment margins were up by 290 basis points year-on-year, driven both by fixed cost leverage and by the mix shift toward higher margin software offerings. In Geospatial, revenues grew organically by 1%. Our && revenue in this segment breaks down across three broad categories: field sales to end users, government business, and OEM business. Sales of our core survey and mapping products to end users returned to meaningful growth in the quarter, reflecting a healthier state of dealer inventories and improving underlying market conditions. Offsetting the strong end user growth, component sales to OEMs were down as we lapped some unusually large shipments a year ago. Segment margins were up by 180 basis points, driven principally by lower component input costs versus year-ago levels. In Resources and Utilities, organic revenue for the quarter was down year-on-year by 4%. Excluding sales of products to agriculture customers, Resources and Utilities revenues were up by approximately 10%. Segment operating margins were lower year-on-year by 160 basis points, driven principally by lower revenue. In Transportation, revenue was up 1% organically. Segment organic ARR was up mid-single digit as growth in our transportation enterprise software and MAPS businesses offset the anticipated impact of churn in our North American mobility offerings. Transporeon remains an inorganic comparison, and the highlight in the quarter for Transporeon was achieving a record level of bookings, up over 20% versus prior year. We were encouraged by the sales performance of the team in light of the difficult macro dynamics in Transporeon's core European market. Segment margins increased year-on-year by 610 basis points, reflecting the higher margins of Transporeon and margin progression in the balance of the segment. Let's move now to 2024 guidance on Slide 11. I will focus on our performance, excluding our Agriculture business and including on a go-forward basis, our more limited exposure to Ag, as a 15% owner of the JV and a supplier of products to the JV. For the sake of completeness, we show on Page 11, two views: a reported view with the Ag business included through the first quarter of 2024; and an as-adjusted view without the agriculture business, which will ultimately be operated within the JV. The outlook for ARR growth remains strong, driven by momentum across our AECO software businesses. We expect full year organic growth rates in the 11% to 13% range, off our year-end 2023 levels of $1.98 billion. As-adjusted organic revenues are expected to grow for the year in the 4% to 7% range. Please note that our fiscal 2024 will include 53 weeks, and the extra week will increase full year and fourth quarter revenues by approximately $85 million. On an as-adjusted basis, we expect margins to improve, with EBITDA margins between 26.5% and 27.5%. This represents margin improvement year-on-year of between 100 basis points and 200 basis points. The margin improvement will come from a combination of improved software mix and the impact of the cost actions we took coming out of 2023. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full year cash flow of approximately 0.85 times non-GAAP net income. Excluding the costs relating to our AGCO JV transaction and the impact of the 53rd week, free cash flow is estimated to be approximately equal to non-GAAP net income. Our base cash flow forecast assumes no change in tax legislation. A bill moving through the U.S. Congress will, if enacted, restore the immediate expensing of R&D for tax purposes. If passed, this legislation would improve incrementally our cash outlook for 2024 by approximately $130 million. Our EPS forecast for the year reflects the beneficial impact of our planned deleveraging following the close of the AGCO JV and up to $800 million of share repurchase. We expect EPS for the year in the range of $2.60 to $2.80. I'll finish by offering a few comments on how our guidance for 2024 breaks out by quarter and by segment. We expect organic revenue growth to be strongest in Buildings and Infrastructure. Software businesses in Buildings and Infrastructure are expected to grow in the mid to high teens with product-related businesses up slightly, leading to organic revenue growth for the full year of between 11% and 13%. Buildings and Infrastructure organic growth includes approximately $70 million from the 53rd week. We plan to accelerate model conversions from perpetual to subscription software, tied with hardware in our civil construction business. Geospatial revenue is expected to be down slightly on an organic basis, with growth in field sales and survey offset by lower sales to U.S. federal customers where business tends to be lumpy from year-to-year. We will also accelerate model conversions from perpetual to subscription software in our survey and mapping business. Resources and Utilities as-adjusted organic growth will be up in the high-single digits, led primarily by continued growth in our positioning services business. Transportation revenues are expected to be up in the mid-single digits for the year and relatively flat on an organic basis, with growth in Transporeon offset by lower North American mobility revenue. We expect reduced hardware revenue in mobility, as we are intentionally pivoting that business away from lower-margin hardware sales to OEMs, instead focusing on the higher value-added data flows. From an operating margin perspective, we expect to grow margins year-over-year in the Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities segments. Transportation margins will be up slightly, while Geospatial segment margins are expected to be down year-over-year due to changes in customer and product mix. For the first quarter, let's turn to Slide 12 for additional color. On an as-adjusted basis, we expect organic growth between 2% and 6%, and EBITDA margin between 26% and 27%. Buildings and Infrastructure is expected to drive most of the organic growth in the first quarter, with low-single digit growth in Geospatial. As-adjusted Resources and Utilities is expected to post high-single digit revenue growth in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we expect to see softness in Ag. Weakness in the global ag market is certainly a factor, but the bigger driver is the expected impact of the transition in our distribution strategy. Transportation revenues in the quarter are expected to be down modestly on an organic basis. Overall, we expect sequential improvement in Transportation segment organic growth rates as the year progresses, driven by gradually improving end market conditions and the inclusion of Transporeon in our organic trends, beginning in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned earlier, we are moving to implement a new segment reporting structure that reflects our updated organization and the way we will evaluate our businesses and allocate capital going forward. Our plan is to publish more details on our new segment reporting structure later in the first quarter, with financials going back two years and the perspective on how our 2024 annual guidance cascades to the new segments. We will have a separate conference call with investors to review that information when it is available. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, David. We were busy in the fourth quarter preparing ourselves to come into 2024 with a running start. We were with over 10,000 customers at Trimble user conferences in September, October and November. We recommitted to our capital allocation priorities, undertook cost reduction, prepared to reorganize the company and made our numbers for the quarter. We plan to host an Investor Day later in the year to discuss the evolution of the business and to provide investors with more financial detail, including updated targets. I will end by taking a moment to welcome Ron Nersesian and Kara Sprague to the Trimble Board, two fantastic additions. Operator, we can now open the line to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kristen Owen from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start with maybe the Q1 guides. It sounds like there's some moving pieces in there. And when I look at this outline that you provided on Slide 12, it looks like Ag is really the driver between the revenue growth numbers there and maybe what we would have expected. So, if you could help us just understand what the underlying growth in the JV assets looks like in the Q1? And just any other moving parts that we should be considering for the 1Q guidance? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Good morning, Kristen. This is Rob, and thanks for the question. So, coming into Q1 and thinking about the guide at the company level, what I would want you to hear is the momentum we have with the ARR and the overall business and the stabilization of the supply chains throughout most of the hardware businesses, which reflects in the total year guide. With respect to the first quarter specifically within the current Resources and Utilities segment, some of this is a quarterization topic, and then when we double click within that, within the Ag business specifically, there's two dynamics to consider: one is, at the overall market level, so call it market sentiment; and then the other is, within the transition of the relationship. So, at the overall Ag market level, you can see that from some of the market statistics from farmer sentiment in the U.S. and Europe, and what we've seen from some of the OEM posts on their numbers and unit expectations coming into the year. So that's part of the topic. And then, the other one is called more the aftermarket side. We're in the transition with the prior corporate relationship we've had and into the new JV relationship. And in that time of transition, there's a natural gap. And so, we never expected, as we've been making this distribution transition, that it was going to be a perfectly linear transition. So, we really think about it at the annual level, not at just a quarter-to-quarter comparison to really track the progress. So, the work is well underway from the integration planning between the teams, from signing up dealers in the aftermarket. So, before you get that revenue in the aftermarket, we've got to be signing up the dealers. And so, it's like comparative to looking at bookings and software business that you got to get the booking before you get the ARR. So, I hope that color helps you, Kristen.
Kristen Owen: Yeah, thanks for that, Rob. The other question that I have is a little bit longer term sort of post this AGCO JV. When we look at some of the momentum that you outlined, particularly around like the TC1 platform, how do you use that as a framework in some of the other areas of the business going forward? If you can outline any areas where maybe you're seeing growth with existing customers, how that's driving that cross-sell revenue? And as you go through these model transitions in some of the field services business, how you can use the success that you've seen in TC1 in those areas?
Rob Painter: Yeah. I'm glad you asked that question, because the work that we're doing around TC1 and currently within the B&I segment, soon to be, you'll hear me talking about it with AECO moving forward, architects, engineers, construction and owners, and the digital transformation work that we've been undertaking, people, process, systems work over these last few years, it's really been vastly proportionate to this construction -- overall construction software part of the business. And really, we see it as the template for the rest of the company. We see it as the tip of the spear. There's a lot of work that's gone into it. There's also a lot of learnings that have come along with it, and I mean that in a very good way. The success of what we see in those bookings is demonstrable proof-point, that the strategy works. So, as we think about taking that into other parts of the business and we look forward, let's say, into the future field systems part of the company, what we saw is -- in the quarter is, that we're growing ARR at a double-digit clip in those businesses. And so, we can already take some of the ideas and frameworks around TC1 into other parts of the business. For example, bundling of our correction services -- positioning services with the hardware products that we have. We've been undergoing some model transitions in some of the hardware businesses, where we can separate value between the underlying hardware and then have a subscription or a term license on top of that. So, it's a -- there are things that happen in parallel. It's not perfectly serial, but for sure on the AECO software side of the business, that is a great template for us, and it has certainly been working so far.
Kristen Owen: Thank you for the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Rob Painter: Hi, Jerry.
David Barnes: Good morning.
Jerry Revich: Rob, why don't we just talk about, given the organizational change, obviously you laid out the restructuring savings and opportunities, can you comment on just beyond restructuring? How has the P&L responsibility shifted at all? It sounds like there are more changes beyond just cost savings. I'm wondering, if you could just expand on that. You alluded to cutting back, I think, on some lower ROI projects. Can you just talk more about the opportunities of the realignment beyond cost savings?
Rob Painter: Sure, Jerry. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a couple examples. At the AECO leadership, Mark Schwartz is looking after that segment for us now. And at the field systems level, Ron Bisio is looking after that. So, two examples of where we reoriented leaders. Ron's history is long -- baseline history of Trimble is within our hardware businesses and dealer channel expertise. And so, we have all of that consolidated under Ron now, across all the hardware-centric businesses we have. Mark Schwartz has spent the bulk of his Trimble career in that AECO software space, and has just done a terrific job picking up the baton here and taking the business forward. And actually under his leadership, the growth has been accelerating in the business. So that's on the people side of the realignment. A couple of examples on the cost side. Jerry, we took a couple of lenses to this. One was we looked at some bigger areas where we saw that the revenue potential was pushing out from more near to mid term to mid to long term. So, Autonomy is an example of that, where we took, I'd say, a bigger chunk view of -- a realignment view on that, and did a reprioritization of capital allocation. The other one was a fair amount of the cloud investments we were making, platform investments we were doing at the corporate level, and what we decided to do was move those closer to the coalface, closer to the business, so it manifested -- given that AECO is the tip of the spear for the transformation work, move that closer to the AECO leadership, where you have to make those capital allocation trade-offs. They are closer to the coalface. And what I see is some organizational efficiency that comes out of that. So, those are a couple examples on the cost side, when we really took a look at saying, how do we get simpler? How do we get more focused? We've got to execute at a sharper clip. And I think Q4 was evidence that those moves are working, and as we come into Q1 and come into 2024, I'm confident that we've got the right org in place working on the right things.
Jerry Revich: Thank you, Rob. And separately, can I trouble you folks just to flesh out the performance of Transporeon for us? Exiting the fourth quarter, what was organic growth, logo growth, retention rates? You mentioned bookings were good. Can you just expand on some of the quantitative numbers on the performance entering '24?
Rob Painter: Sure. Happy to do that. So just as a reminder, that business model is mostly a transaction model, a consumption model. And so, let's say, at the macro level, the European -- and it's still predominantly European-centric business. The economy hasn't improved. I think, we understand that about Europe when I say that, so that's a headwind to some of the transactions, and there's less spot as compared to contract, which is unfavorable to the business model. Within that, though, we think about control what we can control. So, I'll give you some numbers. Gross retention in the business is essentially 100%. I exclude Russia, where we elected not to do some business, and to get out of that business in Russia, ARR in the high-single digits, operating margins above 20%, and at the deal model level that we had, which means the team is doing a good job working the cost line. The fourth quarter itself was a record bookings in the company's history. At new product introduction level, we have new products such as autonomous procurement, which are driving that book -- part of the reason that's driving that bookings growth beyond the value proposition that we already delivered to the customers. And at a product integration level, our global teams are working together to come to a single -- just one single feature for real-time visibility, bringing the MAPS technology, we already had at Trimble, into the Transporeon business, for example. So those are a few statistics, quantitative and qualitative for you, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on your thoughts around, I guess, the macroenvironment as it relates to your guidance and the potential impact to, I guess, the organic growth outlook as you start to look to next year?
Rob Painter: Hey, Jonathan. Good morning. It's Rob. On the macro outlook, well, I'll start with North America -- geographically, North America is the strongest of the overall geographies. Europe is still a challenge, and I think will remain a challenge throughout 2024. So, those are the two major geos that impact the overall business, I would say. Asia Pacific feels a little bit more steady as she goes within that context. Within the vertical markets, in construction, it won't surprise you that we overall see strength in subsegments such as infrastructure, renewables, data centers, reshoring, onshoring drive positive momentum for the bookings. Residential remains more challenged on a global level, and worse so in Europe. The freight markets which would impact our Transportation business, those remained quite challenged, I'd say -- I'd really say globally on that. I commented already on Agriculture, and we see those macros challenged a little bit more globally as well. The thing I would overlay on top of that, Jonathan, as we think about coming into 2024 is, just how structurally different our business is as compared to the Trimble of old. And so, I think it's instructive to think about that $1.98 billion of ARR that we closed the year with. And by the way, that's the way we do that calculation. It's averaged across the fourth quarter. So, if you took really the contracted ARR, what we ended with, that would even be higher. So, we woke up on January 1st with that visibility and predictability into the business. We know from the bookings that we closed the fourth quarter with, how that helps accelerate that growth coming in. So, I think it's an important overlay when we look at the business model. And on one axis -- a business models on one axis, and then the overlay of the geographic and end market segments on the other axis to come to a point of view on the macros that support our view on the guide for the year.
Jonathan Ho: Excellent. And just as a follow up, can you maybe help us understand where we are in terms of the distribution partnership realignment? And what does the opportunity look like just given the divestiture coming up and just the changing nature of your positioning within the space? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Jonathan, do you specifically mean Agriculture? Or do you mean distribution realignment across all of Trimble?
Jonathan Ho: The Agriculture segment of it.
Rob Painter: Okay. All right, from -- okay. So, from the realignment on a distribution, there's a few levers there that we work. One is with the C&H aftermarket dealers themselves, and we continue to be able to sign those up as what we refer to internally as retail outlets that work alongside our full-line vantage dealers. So, the sign-ups of the dealers, I'd say, that goes according to plan. And then, with the AGCO realignment coming in with that, I'd say in addition to that, that's been part of the integration planning work that we've got with the team, and we've got a clear line of sight now to how we're going to work with those new partners coming into the mix. So, in terms of the planning work, I would say it's well underway and it's what we need to do to get the business off to the start, we would like to see it get off to.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much. So, at the last Investor Day, I think you had a slide, you expected about 20% of revenues transacted through the connected digital platform by 2023, and that would go up to 70% by 2024 and 90% by 2025. I know, you're hosting another Analyst Day probably this year. So, where are you in that journey now in terms of getting revenues through that platform?
David Barnes: Hey, Tami, it's David Barnes. One thing I'll say, just as context, is digital transformations and big process and system projects are really hard, and our experience is no different. We ended 2023 with about 15% of our revenue going through the new digital platform, that's principally the North American AECO software businesses. We've been rethinking the scope and focus of our next phase of digital transformation. We'll go from 15% to probably closer to 35% here in early 2024, and that involves bringing more of our businesses. So, including the e-Builder and Cityworks suites, and then expanding the AECO effort all over the globe. We're right now in the process of rethinking how our digital platform interacts best with our hardware businesses and with transportation. So, I'll be -- I'll hold-off in giving a forecast on how we go from 35% to more of the business. I think, we have a more informed and smarter approach now, and we're rethinking our priorities.
Rob Painter: And those priorities, if I can add to that to build on David's comment, is for sure to continue on the software businesses as the priority for the work.
David Barnes: Yeah, that's right. Rob said in his commentary earlier that the AECO business is the tip of the spear. It's where we see the highest, most direct early returns through the digital transformation and TC1 and selling bundles. So, that's where our focus is at the moment.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, David and Rob. The second question I have is, I just wanted to understand the operating margin guidance for this year better. I think, excluding the Ag JV, it seems like you expect about 80 basis points to 180 basis points of operating margin improvement this year. What is really -- what are the building blocks of that? How do you really get there? And also, what is the impact of that 53rd week, if any at all, on that margin guide?
Rob Painter: Tami, I'll start -- this is Rob. I'll start with giving you perspective, and then let's have David build on that. I'll start at the structural level of the company, ending the year at 64.7% gross margin compared to 58% from just five years ago. We look at the operating leverage, we've driven over that five-year timeframe, is at 44%. We talked about the bookings progression in Q4, that adds to the ARR, and that contracted ARR that we would have ended the year with coming into the year. So, at a structural level, the baseline of the business is poised to be able to increase the level of gross margin as we continue to grow the business. And you would see in the web tables the difference between the gross margins at the product level versus at the gross -- product level versus the subscription and software businesses, and just how much higher the gross margin is in the software-centric businesses. So, from a straight mix perspective alone, you drive gross margin up. And I'm talking about that structural gross margin because that is a primary driver of what can enable us to drive that operating margin expansion. We also talked about the costs management in the prepared remarks, which is another side of the equation. And David, do you want to build on that?
David Barnes: Yeah. So, as Rob said, structurally, our recurring revenue businesses are higher gross margin, you can see from disclosure, it's about 80% gross margin on the recurring revenue streams versus about 50% on the product stream. So, a lot of the roughly 100 basis point to 200 basis point margin improvement become -- flows directly from the ongoing mix shift of the business. With regard to the 53rd week, we quantified that that'll have about an $85 million revenue benefit for the year, all in the last quarter. The one thing I'll say though, is that's not the only discreet factor that's impacting our business. As I mentioned in my remarks, our business with big government customers, particularly the U.S. federal government, is lumpy from year-to-year. We talked about that as being a good factor earlier in 2023. So, that'll work against us. And then, we're doing model conversions focused on the software that's bundled with hardware. So, if you actually take the change in the federal business and the impact of the model conversions added to the 53rd week, they roughly offset each other. So, my way of looking at the underlying growth momentum of the business, I would say the 53rd week is a positive. Those other factors offset that positive and they're relatively neutral.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you so much.
David Barnes: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Good morning, Rob. Good morning, David. This is actually [Devin] (ph) on for Jason today. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to start with the construction software business. Nice to hear bookings growth exiting at more than 30% over there. Really strong results. Maybe looking at 2024, seems like macro could be improving and TC1 really seeing strong traction there. How are you kind of thinking about bookings growth to trend for 2024 and any additional maybe puts and takes you can kind of give us on how the different sub-product group would kind of perform for the year?
Rob Painter: Devin. Hey, good morning. This is Rob. Let me give you my perspective and thoughts on the bookings opportunity we have within the AECO software business. And this is a business now that comes into the year with, call it, in the range of $1 billion of ARR to start with, so of the company's, call it, $2 billion of ARR. So, we're talking some law of large numbers to continue to grow at that double-digit ARR clip, and we have to continue to be able to book at a healthy level. And all of 2023 was evidence of that, and accelerated even into the fourth quarter of 2023. So, we come in with some momentum and confidence around that. The color I'd like to put around that with Trimble Construction One is that it unlocks the cross-sell and up-sell by putting in place a framework that allows our customers to easily scale with us, that in turn unlocks our bundles and the offerings that meet the customers' needs. And so, that then creates an environment where inside the company, we're working together to help scale a customer's usage of our products with a lot less friction that they would have had in the past. And we're seeing faster times to close deals. We're seeing a greater share of wallet share captured when a new logo enters our ecosystem. And one of the things we said in the prepared remarks was that our TC1 agreements have now accelerated to make up 50% of the bookings that we had in the fourth quarter. And those agreements are the basis that powers that cross-sell penetration and that made up 25% of the fourth quarter bookings that we had. Coming into 2024, we'll continue to expand TC1 by rolling it out to more regions, for example, Asia-Pacific, and we'll roll it out into more of the portfolio. For example, that's the "O" and the AECO. So, we play those factors forward. We've got a belief set that we can continue to grow those bookings in the AECO space at a quite healthy double-digit level.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. No, that's very helpful color. And then, just a quick follow-up on TC1. It seems like things are really picking up over there. I want to ask, are you still mainly seeing adoptions among existing customers that are opting for TC1? Or are you seeing more new customers kind of adopting that product? And then, in terms of kind of the ASP opportunity, are you still kind of seeing the 2 to 3 times uplift that you kind of highlighted at your Analyst Day from TC1?
Rob Painter: Yeah. Good question, Devin. So, there is both, it's existing customers and new customers. At the existing customers, for sure, and call it in the construction ERP space, those are uplifts that we've continued to drive, the conversions from on-prem to the cloud. And as you make that transition from on-prem to the cloud, doing more than just a lift and shift actually changing the nature of the offering. And it's not just a pricing mechanism, it's a value-based mechanism because then you can get access to the broader array of what we have to offer our customers. We do continue to see a healthy uplift when we make those conversions above a 2x rate. And then, on the new logos, well actually within -- it's sort of a blur between existing customers and new customers. What we can see from the cross-sell data is that the customers who still predominantly are buying one or two solutions from us are picking up that third, fourth, fifth, depending on the nature of the exact bundle that they're buying from us. And then on a straight new logo basis, we are certainly continuing to see wins from new customers. So really, it's all of the above answer. When you have new customers, of course, there's not an uplift in the equation. It's all straight new revenue.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for all the details.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Chad Dillard: Hi. Good morning, guys. So, I wanted to go back to your question about the adjusted operating margins, and I was hoping you could bridge from '23 to '24. Just trying to understand like the moving parts of cost savings mix, operating leverage and more specifically, the impact of the AG divestiture.
David Barnes: Okay. Let me start with the last point. So, when we announced the Ag deal, we said that the impact on a '23 pro forma basis of the divestiture of Ag was about 70 basis points negative to operating margins, so that's where we started, and you can see the '24 outlook in our as-adjusted table. The principal drivers from there, as I mentioned earlier, we're planning on an as-adjusted basis, i.e., without the Ag business in the base, 100 basis points to 200 basis points of margin improvement. One way to think of that, Chad, is essentially all of it is in the gross margin improvement, which is a natural impact of mix. If you drill down a little more, we do have the benefit of cost reduction, but we are adding resources where it's driving growth. In fact, all or slightly more than all of our year-on-year OpEx is in our AECO business, where we had over 30% bookings growth, and we have about 20% ARR growth, we are really allocating our operating capital to pour the coal on that on that business. So, you can think of it as taking the cost reductions we've taken and reallocating it to the highest-return, highest-growth business.
Rob Painter: And if I can build on David's comment, which is exactly right, in that capital allocation call. So, the capital allocation call within the P&L to continue to put that go-to-market OpEx into the AECO space. One of the things I should have said in the response to one of Devin's questions was when we look at the net retention ratio, we're near 110% in the AECO part of the business. It's a terrific, terrific outcome that the team is driving. We look for -- what's an instructive measurement for us is looking at the customer lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition costs. And what that data is telling us is that we're well above three on that is -- that tells us that is a place to continue to put OpEx into. You don't get an ROI on that OpEx in year one. So there's, call it, a trade-off there is that we're playing the long-term game to continue to fuel that bookings growth, which will generate long-term sustainable ARR growth, and of course, overall revenue growth.
Chad Dillard: That's helpful. And then, just on the segment reorg, can you talk about the impact on your distribution in go-to-market? Just trying to understand like the operational changes here. I guess like what you can do better now versus before under the old structure?
Rob Painter: Yeah, Chad, I'm glad you asked that, and that's a good question. And let's take the what we are calling field systems now. So think of that as the -- in the old segmentation, the Geospatial businesses that we have, predominantly the one you'll know the best is survey, and then we have the machine control business that distributes through our SITECH that traditionally have gone through the B&I segment. So those come together under Field Systems, Ron Bisio is looking after that. I'll give you a demonstrable evidence of a change that we already made. We have one person responsible for sales now for all the Field Systems. One in APAC, one in the Americas, and one in Europe, Middle East and Africa. So, one person in each to call that three. And that would have been six people, because we would have had that duplicated just a few months ago. What that does, beyond just driving some -- just efficiencies that you could expect, it actually also allows us to rethink the allocation of how we use resources. That frees up some capability for us to put time and effort and money and people into ongoing dealer development. So, beyond the chase, the short to mid term numbers is actually having resources that can help our dealers think about a long term business. In some cases, Chad, we have dealers who cover multiple businesses for Trimble. Some do both civil and survey, some do ag and survey, some do ag and survey and civil. And with one set of eyes or one set of accountability overall of those is we can make more cogent decisions about how we make natural trade-offs that will happen between the portfolios. If I look at the product -- that's the go-to-market. If I look at the product side, what it unlocks is, I'd say, more efficiency in how we think about measuring the hardware SKUs that we have. Over the last few years, we've reduced the SKUs by 10% in the company. That drives simplification and underlying systems. We have one view on our GNSS portfolio, for example, that goes across the business, one point of view now on the total stations and the scanners that can be used across multiple parts of the portfolio. So, I think it drives just a lot sharper portfolio thinking when we look at it at the product lens. So, we put that product lens together with a go-to-market lens, and I think that positions us well. I think, this is -- I think, it was time to do it, and the announcement of the JV gave us a reason to really rethink how we did things and to move fast to put it in place. And the teams, they did all the planning work in the fourth quarter and they've come out of the gate, I'd say, quite strong here as a team, as an aligned team with a defined set of OKRs, objectives and key results, that we've defined by each of these major businesses.
Chad Dillard: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Tilton: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. In the prepared remarks, you guys talked about being open to continuing to divest certain aspects of the business. When you look across your three new reporting segments, where do you see the most opportunity to maybe divest over the next 12 months and continue to simplify the portfolio?
Rob Painter: Well, good morning. Hey, thanks for the question. This is Rob, I'll give you the lens I have on it. I think about two axes on this one. One axis is the financial profile of the business, call it, the -- yes, there's a short-term view on the profile and then there's a long-term profile view on a business. And can it meet the expectation of returns that we have, whether it's return on invested capital or accretion at an ARR growth or at an EBITDA level. On the other axis, we'll look at the strategic attractiveness of that. That could involve the competitive position, but it also looks a lot at an individual businesses or product, let's say, capability to make the whole stronger. And if something sits on its own and isn't making the whole of the business stronger, so it doesn't contribute to a stronger Transportation business or a stronger Construction business, then it's not in the -- let's say, in the favorable side -- it's on a less favorable side of my 2x2 that I'm laying out, and the financial one speaks for itself on that 2x2. So, if I look and apply it against the portfolio, one of the things, if I take Field Systems as an example, within that, going back to the financial crisis back in 2008, there was a time when we had to step in and be the ballast for some of the dealers at the company. And we came in and we acquired a few of the dealers. But we're not ultimately long-term the best owners of a distribution business. We really think that belongs with entrepreneurs out in the field, very, very local businesses. So that would be an example of the divestiture we talked about here in just actually the last few weeks, as an example. So, we would look for parts of the business like that, that really we don't see ourselves as the best owner. So, I'll comment there as opposed to specifics within each of the businesses. But I think we can demonstrably say that we've had the courage to take a look in the mirror, as evidenced by 21 of the divestitures in the last few years driving this simplification and this focus, because we think that that drives the efficiency and the output and the outcomes for the company.
Joshua Tilton: Very helpful. And then, it also sounds like we're going to get a little more color around the '24 guidance in context of these new reporting segments when you give us that additional disclosure. But maybe if I just step back and take a little bit longer view, like how do you guys think or how should investors think about the different growth rates across those three segments over the next, call it, three to five years?
Rob Painter: Yeah. So I'm going to stay pretty high level on that because, I think, it'll be more appropriate to take that view when we do the next Investor Day. On the slide, I think it's Slide 5 in the presentation that was attached to the prepared remarks, we did give a sizing of AECO Field Systems and Transportation and Logistics, sizing from a view, and it's plus or minus on the revenue for 2024, and maybe more instructively, at the -- with the software breakdown and the recurring revenue breakdown within each of those segments that we'll have. What I can say on top of that, at company level and what we've talked about in the past is we think we can continue to drive the double-digit level of growth of the annualized recurring revenue. And so, that's number one or two on the top strategic priorities I've got for the company. Field Systems makes up the hardware businesses. That's one, I think is instructive to look back to 2019. And if you look at that longitudinal growth of the CAGR over that timeframe, it is in the range of what we have put forward at prior Investor Days in terms of, call it, at a four to 6%, depending on which part of the business, the survey business we've historically talked about at 4% to 6% level, with some of the other hardware being a little bit higher. But that's what compromises that. So you could look at that past data and I think that 2019 to 2023, or you could extend it into 2024 view, fits within the range. We've got that. And obviously, it's been up or down and the standard deviations have been high within a quarter-to-quarter view. That's why we think it's instructed to look at a long baseline view. And then, you'd come to the Transportation business and what's new of course, since the last time we would have done in -- an analyst model or an Investor Day, would have been the addition of Transporeon into the portfolio. So, I'll give you that view to start with, and let's stay tuned. But maybe one thing that's -- an additional thing I'll say that could be interesting is when we last did the Investor Day, we said by -- if you did the math by 2027, that we would be a 60% recurring revenue business. And if you take David's prepared remarks and guide at a pro forma level, we think we'll be there in 2024. I'll leave you with that.
Joshua Tilton: Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes. Hi. So, I wanted to ask two on the Transportation market, if I may, and you touched on this earlier, Rob, on Transporeon, where you had a good bookings quarter in the midst of, I assume, a pretty weak European market. So, any further commentary on what you changed there, or if anything changed to drive that growth? And given that business is levered to spot transactions and rates, any insight as to what the sustainable growth might be when that market comes back? And then just the second question will be simply on the idea of de-emphasizing hardware sales to OEMs in Transportation, and focusing on the flow of data. Is there any strategic link there? Do you get less flow of data if you don't have as much in the field on devices? And could you just talk around that issue? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Yeah, Rob, thanks for the question. So, let's take them in order with the bookings growth in the fourth quarter, and what is still a difficult market overlay. I think it demonstrates the value proposition that the technology provides, and I had a chance to go to our customer conference in Barcelona in September, and what you see in a room like that, and what you can see on the PowerPoint slides are some of the very largest logos in the world who use our Transporeon technology. It's really quite impressive, whether it's retail or CPG, or packaging or building construction materials. When you look through the different verticals, it's really an impressive array of companies and a difficult market environment while companies can be reluctant to either spend the money or to spend the organizational effort to make a change, to do something different, the fact of the matter is that we can drive efficiencies and productivities -- productivity into our customers. What we see is that our win rates are as high as they've ever been. And so to us, that's an important factor in how we think about the business. And the control of what you can control, and not losing market share is an important metric. And we think that the bookings, while they're less than we would like on an overall annualized basis, I'll be clear on that, within what we've got, that they are showing that we're holding, if not gaining share in the market. So, I do have my gratitude to the team for delivering that and fighting it out every day. And you asked about the spot contract mix and what could that look like on the other side. It's like I heard Jamie Dimon, when asked what's the definition of a recession, he said, it's something that happens every seven years. So, take some version of that quote. If it was actually true, take some version of that quote. We know that the freight markets go up and down. So, the market will -- and it does show signs of having stabilized. Now stabilized is different from increasing. What we can see over a long baseline is that the business out of freight recessions has accelerated strongly coming out of that. And it makes sense, and it's a consumption-based model, is that we would expect if the market inflects, and I'm not making a call that it will inflect in 2024, to be clear, as it inflects, the business just naturally can significantly increase the level of revenue that comes through. And I'd say at a strong double-digit level is what I would expect that to move to. And then, last you asked about at the OEM level and the de-emphasizing of the hardware. I'd say the hardware in the Transportation segment is quite different than the hardware around the rest of Trimble. There is less differentiation in that onboard compute, and these days even more of our own in call them, in-cab hardware devices are close to commercial off the shelf tablets. So, making our own hardware years ago was a unique, differentiated factor and it seamlessly integrated into our full software offering, and you are kind of like one throat to choke, offer the full solution. As that technology landscape changed, it's just not a great place to be. We refer to it internally as the lower calorie -- low-calorie revenue, because there's just not attractive margins or [indiscernible] margins with all of the hardware. Not all of the hardware is equal, but at that OEM level, if OEM wants to value engineer the lowest cost hardware, it's just not a place, I think we're going to ever be the best doing that at some kind of global scale. Thus, looking at the data integration. When we look at the data, OEMs have one set of data that they're interested in, which is frankly different than what customers are interested in to run their businesses. That is to say that data on machine health is extraordinarily valuable to the OEMs. And by the way, it is important to customers, but it usually comes to customer service agreements, whereas customers operate mixed fleets of equipment and the customers are trying to drive their own productivity and efficiency and safety and visibility, and to operate within whatever installed base of technology that they've got. And so, we think that data feed will continue to be necessary both at the -- for the OEM level, but also you need to be able to provide a gateway, so to speak, to be able to bring the customers on to a more fully functional, in this case, telematic solution. And by the way, whether that's Trimble or not Trimble solutions, I think that would be true for the market to have that flexibility. So Rob, I hope that helps provide some color.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining us today. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Trimble Third Quarter 2023 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I’d now like to welcome Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer to begin the conference. Rob, over to you.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. Simplification, focus and execution are the themes of today. I will start with a review of the third quarter, then put a Trimble lens in the current market environment we see, followed by an overview of how we are taking action to maintain our strategic and financial progression. Let’s begin on Slide 2 with a review of the third quarter. The clear highlights were continued ARR growth and gross margin progression, which translated into EBITDA progression. ARR stands at a record $1.94 billion, up 25% and up 13% organically. 50% of our revenue is now recurring. Gross margin finished at a record 65%, a reflection of our Connect and Scale strategy translating into a more durable and attractive business model. EBITDA at 28% is also a record. The big strategic news of the quarter was the announcement of our joint venture with AGCO in our agriculture business. Slide 3 reviews our key messages to shareholders. The venture positions us to simplify, focus and derisk our business while deleveraging and returning capital to shareholders. As we discussed on our announcement call, the impact on pro forma 2023 numbers moves Trimble to 72% software and 55% recurring revenue. We are proud to partner with Eric Hansotia and his team at AGCO to be a global leader in mixed fleet smart farming and autonomy solutions. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of next year. And I’d like to say that we are really pleased thus far with the internal and external reaction to our partnership. In the quarter, we also divested our Landfolio business, which had approximately $10 million of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. We have now divested 18 businesses over the last 3 years and pursued a simplification and better focus to execute our strategy. Looking at the business with a global macroeconomic lens, we see increasing signs of weakness and stress across many end markets and geographies, exacerbated by interest rates, war and geopolitical tensions. These factors contribute to our updated view on the fourth quarter, which have embedded bearish and bullish signals. On the bearish side, we see the downturn in residential construction impacting our hardware businesses in both Buildings & Infrastructure and Geospatial. While we see strength in major projects, renewables and onshoring of manufacturing, we aren’t seeing enough earthmoving activity to overcome this dynamic, especially in Europe. In agriculture, within resources and utilities, we see emerging signs of weakness also notably in Europe. We also expect some choppiness in the numbers as we execute our new distribution strategy in preparation for our AGCO joint venture. In transportation, I think it’s safe to say that we are in a down freight market, and we’ve seen some trucking and technology companies either go out of business or cut back their ambitions significantly. On the bullish side, let’s remember that we sell productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. This is a secular value proposition. In Buildings and Infrastructure, software bookings were up more than 30%, demonstrable evidence that the strategy works and that the dollar volume of construction is healthy. Our Trimble Construction One business model framework is delivering results. We are releasing a series of customer persona-based targeted offerings and our systems enhancements are providing new levels of visibility and insight into our customers. Machine control as a service offering also exceeded bookings expectations in the quarter. In Geospatial, we continue to innovate to drive the replacement cycle and our new business models contribute to ARR growing at a double-digit rate within the surveying and mapping business. Next week, we will hold our Annual Trimble Dimensions Engineering and Construction User Conference, where thousands of industry participants will come together to learn and engage in our latest innovations. In resources and utilities, our non-ag businesses collectively grew ARR double-digits. In transportation, the shakeout in the industry will, in time, have the appropriate effect of restoring the balance in capacity and demand and bringing more discipline to the competitive landscape. Against this backdrop, we are taking action to protect our financial model, starting with a greater than $40 million run-rate cost reduction initiative as we take action to simplify and better focus our company to operate efficiently and effectively. This is in addition to cost containment initiatives that we undertook in the third quarter. We will simplify by reorganizing our operating businesses and bringing corporate resources closer to customers. For example, we have incubated our industry cloud platform work at a corporate level the last couple of years. It’s now time to embed that within the business and sharpen capital allocation. We will focus by getting the right leaders in the right seats and scaling back some of our initiatives to enable the core to better deliver short and mid-term outcomes. David, over to you.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let’s start on Slide 4 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue of $957 million was up 8% in total and up 2% organically. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 1%, while acquisitions net of divestitures increased revenue by 5%. Subscription and recurring revenue continued to grow at a strong rate. As Rob mentioned a moment ago, the weakening macro environment adversely impacted customer sentiment and demand across all of our hardware end markets. Gross margin in the third quarter was a record 65%, up 410 basis points year-over-year, driven by an increasingly favorable business mix and the ongoing net impact of pricing and reduced input cost inflation. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins also expanded year-over-year due to the progression in gross margins and the benefit of cost reduction actions we took early in the quarter. Net income dollars increased by 4% and earnings per share grew year-over-year to $0.68, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance range. We are very pleased with our margin performance in the third quarter, delivering strong bottom line results even in the face of a tougher macroeconomic environment. Turning now to Slide 5, I’ll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. On this and the next few pages, I will focus on organic growth rates, excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations. ARR was up 13%, driven in part by strong bookings across our construction software businesses. Our digital platform work is enabling cross-sell of bundled solutions. Our non-recurring revenue streams, including hardware and perpetual software, contracted by 8% year-over-year and came in below our expectations. The macro environment worsened late in the quarter across many of our hardware end markets with weakening customer sentiment and propensity to invest. The impact was especially visible in Europe, where macro trends are the most difficult. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 5%. In Europe, revenues were down 1%. Moving to Slide 6. Our cash flow from operations was $147 million with free cash flow of $134 million, both of which are up significantly versus prior year. Our cash flow in the quarter benefited from lower purchases of inventory, lower tax payments and higher profitability. The working capital dynamics of our business remains strong with negative net working capital. We entered the fourth quarter with $1.6 billion in backlog inclusive of ag committed backlog expected to ship before our ag JV transaction closes. We project that $1.1 billion of our backlog will be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. We ended the quarter with leverage measured as net debt to EBITDA of 2.9x, reflecting the repayment of $115 million of net debt during the quarter and repayment of $270 million since the closing of the Transporeon acquisition. Note that we are ahead of our time line to pay-down our Transporeon debt with leverage going below 3x one quarter ahead of the commitment we made when the deal was announced. Finally, I’ll repeat what Rob mentioned earlier. During the quarter, we reached an important milestone with half of our revenue now coming from recurring revenue streams. The formation of our ag JV will further accelerate our business in the direction of majority recurring revenue, making our business both more predictable and more resilient. Let’s turn now to Slide 7 for additional detail on each of our reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 6%. Revenue growth was strong across our software businesses in the segment with double-digit year-over-year ARR and revenue increases at e-Builder, Viewpoint, SketchUp and Tekla. This broad-based growth reflects the success and momentum of our Connect and Scale strategy, evidenced by growing bookings, especially of larger and broader bundles. Our Civil Construction business was down year-over-year at a high single-digit rate as the demand environment weakened among dealers and end customers. Geospatial revenue was down 2%, reflecting lower demand across many survey end markets. One bright spot for our Geospatial business in the quarter was with our U.S. federal government customers, who continue to place orders well ahead of prior year levels and above our expectations earlier in the year. Resources and Utilities revenue was down 4%, reflecting both declining farmer sentiment and the impact of our distribution network changes. Revenue declines were most pronounced in Europe, which makes up the largest portion of our ag hardware business. Partially offsetting the weakness in hardware demand, we experienced double-digit segment ARR growth in Positioning Services, forestry and Cityworks. Financial results in our Transportation segment showed progression in a number of areas. Organic ARR was up at a mid-single-digit rate and margins expanded for the seventh quarter in a row. On the other hand, our mobility business in North America has not seen the uptick in bookings that we originally expected. With planned chart notifications in the quarter, our Transportation segment ARR momentum will moderate going into next year. Transporeon top line trends remain below our expectations when we bought the business, driven almost entirely by a contraction in overall industry shipment volumes and the depressed spot market. Importantly, we have maintained our customers and our market share. And with our transaction-based recurring model, we are positioned to recover with an improvement in the overall European goods economy when the inevitable upswing takes place. The Transporeon team has managed costs well in this tough environment, and our operating margin since the deal closed remained in line with our original expectations. Moving to Slide 8, I will now discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our third quarter results reflect a weakening demand environment. We expect this weakness to extend through the fourth quarter and into next year. We now project fourth quarter revenue between $890 million and $930 million. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects 13% growth in ARR, offset by a decline in our hardware and perpetual software at a low to mid-single-digit rate. This yields a full year revenue outlook of $3.76 billion to $3.80 billion. A significant majority of the reduction in revenue outlook is in our hardware businesses with the biggest impact in Civil Construction Hardware. For perspective, it is helped to look back to the pre-COVID period to determine the underlying long-term trends of our hardware businesses. All three of our core hardware businesses, Geospatial, Agriculture and Civil Construction, have grown at a compound rate of mid-single digit or better since 2019, and our fourth quarter guidance reflects a continuation of this long-term trend. We project that the combined impact of higher gross margins and lower operating expense versus our prior outlook will offset much of the impact of our lower revenue forecast, resulting in an EPS range for the fourth quarter of $0.55 to $0.63. Our updated full year guidance for EPS is $2.58 to $2.66. Fourth quarter operating margins are projected to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%, a meaningful improvement from year ago levels, but sequentially down from the third quarter, driven primarily by mix. Within the overall outlook for the fourth quarter, we anticipate the following segment trends. Buildings and Infrastructure will remain our strongest segment with organic revenue in the quarter accelerating from third quarter levels to the mid- to high single digits. Even in the current macro environment, we see strong demand for our software offerings, while our hardware businesses are expected to be down at a mid-single-digit rate. Geospatial segment revenues are expected to be down at a low to mid-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter. Gradual improvement across some areas of our core field survey business will be offset by lower sales in the fourth quarter to the U.S. federal government. Geospatial margins in the fourth quarter will come down sequentially from third quarter levels due to a less favorable business mix. Resources and Utilities revenue are expected to be flat to down at a low single-digit rate. This fourth quarter outlook reflects both the adverse overall demand environment and the impact of our ongoing aftermarket dealer network transition. ARR growth in the segment will remain at a strong double-digit level. Transportation segment revenues will be flat or down modestly as the impact of higher customer churn in our North American mobility business offsets the growth across the rest of our transportation offerings. This outlook assumes no meaningful improvement in Transporeon’s core European transportation market in the fourth quarter. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full year 2023 free cash flow in the range of $530 million to $555 million. Excluding the impact of full year transaction-related and restructuring-related cash outflows of approximately $100 million, this outlook represents free cash flow of approximately 1x net income. With our strong year-to-date cash flow performance and with contractual certainty on the upcoming close of our Ag JV transaction, we plan to reinitiate share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Consistent with past practice, we plan to issue guidance for 2024 at our fourth quarter earnings release in February. At this point, our outlook for next year can be characterized threefold. First, we expect that organic revenue growth trends will be better than those we posted this year as our hardware business has stabilized following the declines of 2023 and as recurring revenue sources make up a growing proportion of our total revenue base. Second, we believe ARR will continue to grow at a double-digit rate. Even in the context of a tough macro environment, our bookings and net retention performance continue to support this outlook. Third, with the cost reduction actions we are taking, we expect to hold or improve EBITDA margins even with the impact of the close of our AGCO deal. This outlook leaves us on track to achieve the EBITDA margin goals we put forward in our Investor Day last year. Rob, I’ll turn it back over to you.
Rob Painter: I want to end the call on the same themes we started with today simplification, focus and execution. The cost action and the organizational moves we’ve discussed, in addition to the forthcoming Ag joint venture, all drive simplification and enhanced focus on our Connect and Scale strategy. On execution, we humbly learned from our failures and successes. We also have the confidence and conviction to manage through this economic environment. We’ve done this for decades, we know what we need to do, and we will stay focused on delivering productivity, quality, safety, transparency and sustainability for our customers. And we will continue to invest and innovate against our best growth opportunities. We will exit this economic downturn on a stronger competitive footing. Finally, we are announcing today that David Barnes has decided that he will retire as our CFO in May. Phil Sawarynski, our Vice President of Corporate Development, Treasurer and Co-Head of Trimble Ventures, will succeed David. David, Phil and our strong finance team will work together to ensure a smooth transition over that timeframe. I’m very grateful for having had David’s steady hand over the last 4 years as we’ve navigated crises that neither of us ever envisioned. True character reveals itself in a crisis. David’s character represents something we would all benefit from emulating. Phil comes into the role having been at Trimble for 14 years, having worked across a very diverse set of roles along the way. Phil’s mandate for the role is straightforward to leverage his deep knowledge of the company to unlock shareholder value. Operator, we can now open the line to questions.
Operator: Thank you for the presentation. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning everyone and David congratulations.
David Barnes: Thanks, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Rob, David, I’m wonder if you could just talk about the outlook for ARR growth for the construction software portfolio. It looks like you’re seeing a slowing into the fourth quarter based on the ARR guidance revision. Can you just expand on what that means for the construction portfolio, specifically where you’re nearly 20% in the quarter, what magnitude of slowing are you seeing there and touch on other moving pieces, if you don’t mind.
Rob Painter: Hi. Good morning, Jerry and thanks for the question. This is Rob. I’ll take it. Actually, the bookings for the software businesses and construction continue to be strong in the third quarter. The ARR growth in the B&I segment was over 20% for the quarter as well in Q3. So actually, I see continued strengths into the fourth quarter with our view on ARR growth in that segment. So actually, I would say really the narrative holds there. FX is a bit of a headwind to the ARR growth that will be posted at the top line. So adjusted for that, I think we remain on track.
David Barnes: Yes, hey, Jerry the changes in ARR growth, we’re talking tens of basis points. The big story is that the growth is sustained as Rob said, bookings are really good. There’s no fundamental change in the momentum of our B&I ARR business.
Jerry Revich: Okay. So FX is a key driver then. Okay. And then can we shift gears and talk about the margin trajectory, given that performance in the quarter and exiting the year. I know we’re not talking about ‘24 guidance yet, but it feels like you’ve got margin tailwinds versus the run rate in the first half of 2023. So as we think about the puts and takes around what ‘24 might look like, obviously, some end market challenges. But it feels like, at least on a year-over-year basis, there should be some margin momentum. I’m wondering, if you wouldn’t mind commenting on any other puts and takes we should keep in mind?
David Barnes: Yes. Sure, Jerry. I’ll reiterate the comments in the prepared remarks. Our margin trends are very strong. We think sequentially, Q4 won’t look quite as good as Q3. We had – that’s a mix issue, both between software and hardware and within the hardware part of our portfolio. But fundamentally, our margin story is really good. And we’ve taken actions to manage our operating expense very carefully. Actually, that started early this year. Rob mentioned that we’re going to move even further here in Q4. Our goal is looking into next year to be in a position where we can maintain or grow our EBITDA margins. And I’ll point out that we’re – that includes the impact of the creation of the Ag JV. And if you go back to the financial remarks we had when we made that announcement, we said the creation of the JV puts downward pressure of 70 basis points on our EBITDA margin. We’re looking to cover that. So yes, margin is a great story. Obviously, the top line on the hardware part of our business has been softer than we anticipated. But the margin story is even better, and that’s something we are carefully managing looking into next year.
Jerry Revich: Super. And lastly, can you just comment on leading indicators within Transporeon? I don’t know if you folks have visibility based on that business in terms of customers prepared shipping plans or anything along those lines. And how are you thinking about fourth quarter seasonally for that part of the portfolio?
David Barnes: Yes. So as you can imagine, we’re – we have visibility every day to a very significant portion of the European transportation market. I think I’d characterize it as stabilizing after a very weak period over – after the last three or four quarters, well, since we bought the business. We’re not declaring a turnaround yet. But if you look at the metrics of transportation volumes, spot pricing, capacity utilization, not necessarily getting better, but it stopped getting worse. So we can see the stabilization and over time, very hard to predict exactly when. But over time, those will recover and with our transaction-based ARR model, the business will recover with it. So it’s stabilizing. It’s still the freight market in Europe. And I think in America, you characterize it as in recession, particularly some of the end markets. Actually, we can see by part of the economy what’s weak, where there is fewer trucks on the road, shipping goods. But construction equipment, paper and packaging are way down versus last year, reflecting the overall macroeconomic weakness. So we think we’ve stabilized. That’s the basis of our fourth quarter, and we will plan for some improvement looking into next year, but we will be cautious, given the magnitude of the drop that occurred over the last three quarters.
Rob Painter: And Jerry, if that’s the macro. When I look at the micro to complement that, we have 100% customer retention and our win-loss ratios are holding. So our market share is holding in the region. I think that’s important to keep in mind as well for the underlying health of the business.
Jerry Revich: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, I have two questions, if I may. The first one is a little bit micro, I guess. But could you look at channel inventory across the businesses on the hardware side? And just do you have an estimate or a ballpark of how much channel inventory there is to come out if you could see a destock and how long that might take? And then the second question is really for Rob, because your tone obviously indicates a more negative macro environment kind of already here. And I’m a bit curious if you’re seeing that in today’s construction market or whether that’s more of a forecast? Thanks.
David Barnes: Hey, Rob, it’s David. I’ll take the dealer inventory question first. We did see a very meaningful inventory destock in the first half of this year, particularly in the first quarter. You probably recall, I said we estimate it was about $40 million in the first quarter, less than that in the second quarter. It’s not really a factor in the back half of this year. Actually, in some of our end markets, dealer inventory went up by just a little bit in Q3. The one change we’re seeing, and Rob referenced this in his remarks, is that on the civil side, we’re seeing the set point, the desired inventory level for our dealers has actually come down. That reflects higher interest rates, so higher cost of carrying inventory. It reflects the uncertainty about the demand market and frankly, our very good product supply. So the need to hold inventory is less than it was. So that won’t be helpful to us. I think we will see a modest correction. Nowhere near like Q1 and Q4. We’re talking in the $10 million to $20 million range. But we think dealer inventories in aggregate are close to where they will be over the longer-term.
Rob Painter: I’ll take the second part, Rob, on the macro and what we’re seeing. There is a tale of geographies embedded within that – within the answer. So I’ll roughly speaking to North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Let’s look at North America. You won’t be surprised that sub-segments such as the data centers, the renewable energy, the onshoring and manufacturing, those are all positive catalysts. The Infrastructure Bill remains a positive catalyst. The asterisk on that one is when you compare the dollar volume within the dollars associated with infrastructure build, compared to the dirt actually moved is what we see as inflation has been eating up a fair amount of that additional spend. And then residential. For sure, we see interest rates having an impact in the residential markets. In Europe, I would say you have the same factors, but you have residential is worse than what we see in the U.S. And Asia Pacific, we see – well, not surprisingly, we see India being better. We see China being worse. You connect the China economy to a decent amount of the Australian economy, and we see some of the residential construction being slower in that market. So add those up and you have our view on the present state of construction. And let me be clear, within that is we have software businesses and we have hardware businesses. I mentioned it during the first question that we had 30% bookings increase in our construction software business in the third quarter. We had ARR growing over 20% in B&I. So there is a different behavior happening within the software business and within the hardware business. The feedback that we get from the market on that is that customers, they continue to have trouble finding qualified labor, managing that labor. They have strong overall backlog, particularly in the Americas. And so that backlog and that complexity and managing the workout in the field is a catalyst for the software adoption and that plays through into the numbers we have. So now we take the present and we map to the future, which was the other part of your question. We’re essentially saying we don’t see it getting better, fundamentally better, fundamentally inflecting, particularly on the residential, and that’s the one probably I should comment on most discretely as our planning assumption at this point is assumed into 2024 that it doesn’t get better. Of course, when interest rates come down, that will be a positive thing next year. And we know in places like here in the U.S. that we do need additional housing. So there is a dislocation, fundamental dislocation. So as the interest rates moderate, I think it’s reasonable to think that, that will get better. But for now, our planning assumption, I think the smart thing to do is just assume it doesn’t.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: Hi. Yes, good morning. Just to go back to the expectations around overall ARR. Like you said, it did not sound like there is much movement in your outlook around the B&I related to ARR. What about transportation? Should we expect that, that still tracks up mid-single digits, the track that it’s been on?
David Barnes: Hey, Rob, it’s David Barnes. I’ll take that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that bookings are coming in soft in our North American mobility business in transportation and we received notification turn that will occur going forward. So our – while our ARR has been looking better recently, we do think that will – the churn we have in our North American mobility business will adversely affect transportation ARR growth in Q4 and going into next year by somewhere around 200 basis points. Now I’ll emphasize that the rest of the transportation ARR base is doing really well. Our Maps business is growing ARR at double-digit rate, even Transporeon were growing ARR. Our enterprise business is growing ARR. Actually, our mobility business in Europe and in Brazil is good. So the North American mobility business represents about quarter of transportation ARR, and that – the trends there are going to be more adverse. So the sort of core base outlook is for transportation, ARR growth to be adversely impacted by a couple of hundred basis points going forward because of the churn dynamic in North American mobility.
Rob Mason: Understood. Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up then. I understand you don’t want to speak too broadly about 2024, and this may just be somewhat of a transitory dynamic with the AGCO transaction coming up. But just how should we think about the ending of the CNH aftermarket agreement and the impact relative to your efforts to try to backfill that. Obviously, AGCO is a solution. But until that transaction closes, I’m just curious how to think about modeling that impact next year.
Rob Painter: Hey, Rob, that’s a good question. I’ll take that one. CNH continues to be an important customer and partner for Trimble and for the JV on an ongoing basis. So the nature of the agreement when we changed our approach to ag distribution and made the announcement the change in the relationship with that CNH aftermarket distribution, which we did earlier in the year. That’s not a change from CNH as a customer and a partner, it really was saying we’re going to – as we work with the dealers in the future, we need as part of our – through our strategy to be able to work with the dealers directly to have more of that signal of what’s happening in the market and being closer to the end customer. So they have been an important customer. They are an important customer. They will be an important customer going forward, as well AGCO, obviously, through the nature of the joint venture and say, remember, we serve the mixed fleet. And that means all colors of iron, including over 100 OEMs that we work with today. So that’s our view on the shape of the market. Now clearly, CNH will have an ambition set to have more of their own technology. And we know that – and you know that through the acquisitions that they have done. So in time, that will be, I’d say, a topic but let’s remember that we have hundreds of thousands of units out in the machine. We have many, many farms who operate on Trimble technology, and we believe we will continue to do so in the future. So there will be some disruption as we go through the change for sure. And we expected that. That’s been largely in the numbers we’ve had and certainly part of the conversation we had with AGCO when we establish a joint venture.
Rob Mason: Is there a way, Rob, to isolate how much – there was some reference to the distribution transition in the third quarter, how much impact that’s causing the R&D segment today?
Rob Painter: I would measure it in, I’d say, some millions of dollars, like so call it in the low single-digit percentage of the disruption. But I also think that, that could very well be a timing topic. In fairness to CNH dealers, in this case, there were two announcements this year, one when at the beginning of the year, when we talked about changing the arc of the relationship; and the second was the JV announcement. So I think it is reasonable to assume that some of these dealers have taken a step back and paused and sort of hear, hey, what does this mean and where do we go. There is demand out there in the market and customers use our technology. So we believe through our new distribution strategy, the Vantage distribution strategy, that we can capture and meet that need out in the marketplace. It just may shift from, I’d say, this year into next year.
Rob Mason: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to, I guess, better understand sort of your commentary around the bundling opportunities in the B&I business. Can you maybe help us understand maybe what the customers are seeing as they are starting to adopt Trimble One and some sort of your broader platform approach and maybe what that means from an upsell and ASP opportunity perspective?
Rob Painter: Good morning, Jonathan, good question. What we hear from – well, let’s talk about what we’re doing and what we hear from the customers. What we hear from customers is that similar to my remarks earlier is that they are looking to work with us in a differential way. They are looking to move from delivering task productivity to system productivity. They are looking to manage the volume of work that they have and the complexity they are in. They are looking at us and saying, we want to do more business with you, Trimble. It’s in the – part of the consistent theme has been make yourselves easier to do business with. And that’s where Trimble Construction One is part of that – is part of delivering that. And what we see from the data is we continue to grow the cross-sells. So we look at the cross-selling on a year-over-year basis, and it’s a strong double-digit increase in the amount of cross-selling. And so we can manifest that cross-selling through, think of it as the TC1 offering. TC1 is a framework agreement essentially makes it easier to buy more Trimble solutions together in that bundle. And then where we go further with those bundles is defining those at a persona-based level, a customer persona-based level. That is to say a steel fabricator could use and benefit from a set of Trimble solutions different than the mechanical contract or different than the general contract or different than the architect. And so the persona-based bundling offerings create bundles specific to those personas. And at our best, we can offer or sort of fullest manifestation of this, we can offer a good, better, best offering within those personas. And we’re still, I’d say, quite early in this journey. And so that’s one of the many things that gives me conviction that we’ve got runway to work with here in the business.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Can you give us a bit more color on how the machine control as a service business is trending? And how those deals sort of work and whether this can help customers in a more cost contained environment? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks for that question. I actually probably should have mentioned that during the – in the call. We actually have seen a higher level of adoption of the machine control as a service than was in our original expectations. So actually, that creates a negative delta to the top line revenue, as you know, right, for a subscription as opposed to a perpetual sales. So the adoption in the third quarter actually really year-to-date has been ahead of the expectations that we have for the business. For sure, if you think about proxy in the software world, what we’ve seen through the transitions we’ve made is not only do you make the technology more affordable in doing so, you expand the size of the addressable market. And we’ve seen that time and time again in the markets we’ve served in software as we’ve made these transitions. I’d like to believe that, that’s a possible outcome as well in the hardware world, is that we can expand the size of the addressable market. And you think about the cost environment that we’re in or that we certainly we see that we’re in and we see that as a positive catalyst in that market. But I think even more interesting than that is once you’re monetizing on a subscription level on the machine control side, we believe it becomes much easier to package the relevant software offerings along with it as well. And so that’s a preview of where some of our next releases will go into Civil Infrastructure bundles that capture relevant Trimble software along with the hardware. And then you asked about the business model that goes with it specifically. Well, we’ve had two versions of it. One, you go straight subscription on the entirety of the offering. And the other one is you do a split with the hardware and the software, which is to say you’d do a nominal amount upfront for some of the hardware and then you monetize the rest of the subscription. I think we’re going to see us do more of the latter over time. You can create some, I’d say, better aligned economics with the dealer channel in between when you have that upfront, a nominal amount of the hardware being sold upfront and actually also helps our cash flow ourselves as Trimble, and the customers have seemed to be reasonably indifferent of the two offerings. So that’s where I think we will lean more into that one going forward.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Charles Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys. So I just wanted to double-click on the cost cuts that you have highlighted in your prepared remarks, $40 million. So first of all, are you expecting that to hit full run rate in 2024? Second, can you give a little bit more color on how it’s allocated? And third, how much is structural versus variable?
Rob Painter: So the – well, so it’s all structural is the first answer on the number. Our expectation is that we come into 2024 with that in place to build a move forward on that one. And then within the subset of the allocation, here’s how I’d want to portray it as we look at the portfolio of activities and businesses that we have. First, you take our software businesses, particularly the ARR businesses that are posting the rule of 40, rule of 50 and in some cases, beyond where we’ve got that growth. We’re going to continue to invest and grow the expenses in that, where we’re driving the bookings, which drives the ARR growth. And we look at the lifetime value to the customer acquisition cost as a strong measure of where to allocate capital. On the flip side, we look at activities that have been a little further out in their nature or where the shape of the market adoption is scaling back on, where the world is scaling back on, let’s say, some of the ambition set that we have. And so we will look there. So it’s very ROI based in our approach. And it’s very strategic based because this is not going to be just a kind of a peanut butter approach. We will move activities that we have at the corporate level closer to the businesses, for example, the industry cloud work, that we have doing and we have been – I think we did the right thing to incubate that, the company – excuse me, through the corporate level for the last couple of years. Now we can get that embedded into a business and then sharpen the allocation within the business between the work we do within the short, mid and long-term.
Charles Dillard: That’s helpful. And then second question is just trying to understand how resilient the B&I business is to slow down. Maybe you can break it up into two parts, software versus hardware. Software sounds like based on bookings, it is relatively resilient. But I would love to understand like how long the contract duration is and how to think about that? And then on the hardware side, just try to think about significant amplitude there?
Rob Painter: Chad, the way I think about the software side is it certainly has proven thus far to be more resilient. Hey, with the software that you are using in Trimble, but I would say the same thing on the hardware. But the software our customers use is its mission-critical software. It’s not sitting on a shelf. It’s a nice to have. So, I would say as long as they have got customers have the backlog and the work and the customers have a need to digitize, the customers has a need to become more productive and more efficient and that’s a good setup for the resilience of that business and I think we could trust we could create that as a mega trend happening within many industries is the digitization of the work. The other thing that drives resilience in our view is when we have been selling and when we are selling the bundled offerings, when we are working with customers in a broader and bigger way, we think that, that has us closer to the customers. As the relationships become closer, we think that, that drives continued usage of the technology over time. So, perfectly resilient, there is certainly – that can certainly be challenged at what point does that – what would it take for that to inflect. But we haven’t seen it. And we look at from our gross retention, we look at the net retention ratios, we look at the cross-sell, up-sell opportunities we have. We think we are sitting on many hundreds of millions of dollars of opportunity just within the portfolio that we have. So, that makes me optimistic about the setup that we will have. Now, will the numbers grow in percentage terms as much over time while a lot of large numbers likely kicks in at some point. We are approaching – we are not just approaching $1 billion or almost at $1 billion of ARR just within the B&I segment alone. So, posting 20% ARR growth and 30% bookings growth is pretty special, and the team deserves the recognition for that. The hardware businesses, hey, the fact, brutal facts are that it is less resilient. The hardware is a book and burn business. Very little of it today is sold on a subscription basis. And yes, we would like to do more of that over time. Now, we also are in control of some of our own resilience. That is the expansion to machine types. It’s geographic penetration. It’s the combining the hardware and the software that we have at Trimble to drive resilience into that. So, I don’t think we are just victim to the environment around us. I also think there is a lot we can control within that. And I will net that out by saying I don’t think that hardware is ultimately as resilient as the software. However, I think it is as powerful as the software, because what we can uniquely do at Trimble is connect the physical and digital worlds, that ability to connect the work in the office and the field and the hardware and software is especially unique and different.
Charles Dillard: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen: Hey. Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on some of the B&I commentary and just given some of the success that you have noted in becoming easier to do business with. I am wondering if you can speak to market share versus wallet share gains. How much of the growth are you experiencing is coming through customers just using more Trimble products versus maybe any shift in the competitive landscape, or are you merely just tackling white space there?
Rob Painter: Hi. Good morning Kristen. It’s a good question and thanks for that. The – I would say the reality is that there is a lot of white space within the market, and we look at the peers in the construction technology space, and many of them are also continuing to grow. And so I look at the map of the collective growth of peers and the industry. And to me, the only way the math works on that is that there is a secular adoption of the technology as the industry digitizes. We know it’s a greater than $1 trillion industry in construction that has historically been underserved and underpenetrated with technology and the trends around that are a positive catalyst for the adoption of technology. So, let me start with acknowledging that. Now within that, what we see is from the cross-selling that we are doing, that to me is a metric where I would call that the wallet share that says we are doing something that’s unique and different and we think that nobody else can do that quite like we can. We have technology that serves the – across the AECO landscape, architects, engineers, construction and the owners. That’s quite different, and that’s just the software, but now bring in the hardware components that happen there. And not just the hardware that’s in with B&I, but the hardware that’s within survey. Because the survey ultimately is creates the digital – starts the workflow that is creating the digital model and then turning very often into a set of construction workflows from there. On the market share topic, we do believe that we are gaining share within certain market segments and certain market segments and certain customers. And I qualify that with the word certain. I would say if you could characterize customers simply put as some who buy on best of breed or some who buy best of suite. When customers are buying best of suite, I would say we are gaining share with those customers because we can offer increasingly a better native integration of that data and the workflow across the industry life cycle. And we see positive feedback and uptick for customer who are wanting to buy suites from companies. I would say for those who buy best of breed, I would say we hold our own overall. But even within that, I could say I could double-click within the construction ERP business, I would say we are clearly who gained share in the markets that we serve. I look in the architecture space, with the SketchUp product, we are going on multiple years now very, very strong double digit ARR growth and that to me would suggest, we are gaining some share in the conceptual modeling.
Kristen Owen: That’s really helpful. Thank you, Rob. I am going to shift gears a little bit. You talked about the macro environment, some of the headwinds facing the transportation business. But at 18.2% operating margins, this is the highest segment operating margin that you printed since before the ELD Mandates. So, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about maybe what’s working on the cost side of the equation for that business, how much of that is uplift from Transporeon versus some of the hard work that you guys have been doing over the last couple of years? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Good question. I would give you a two-fold answer. First, I would say within the, call it, the run rate [ph] business, we have within transportation and then second is the Transporeon dynamic. Within the run rate business that we have, we have been working steadily to clearly the increase the gross margins and that we have in the business and I think to me the path that I think about was growing operating margins I go straight to the structural topic around that at the gross margin level and so to have which implies both have the products with the right eye proposition that get the right price and we got the right set of COGS that are associated with that and it’s becoming more software-centric. In transportation, I want to be less dependent on the hardware. In fact, in the more long-term basis, being more hardware agnostic on the telematics side of the business, whereas hardware differentiates, truly differentiates throughout the rest of Trimble. It’s less so the case with the onboard computer in that side of the business. So, that’s a structural shift, right, when we can – when we really manifest more software forward, that’s a structural increase in the gross margin that can flow down to the profitability of the business. And then the other way you do that as you are getting the gross margins where they need to be, and it’s also managing the operating expenses along with that, so which the team has done a, I would say, a pretty good and certainly steady job of incrementing that forward for many quarters now as you noted. Now, you layer in Transporeon on top of that and that is accretive to the margins within the segment. And so if we do our job and if the market will do us some favors here and start to turn next year, then that would again be a positive catalyst for the margins in the business.
Kristen Owen: Thank you so much.
Rob Painter: Next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jason Celino: Great and just one for me. This follows up on one of the other questions. When we think about B&I hardware and construction software, who are the typical decision-makers at your customers? Like are they separate budget decisions? How tight are those purchasing decisions between the two? I don’t know if that’s a good way of thinking about it.
Rob Painter: Hey Jason. Thanks for the question. I would say it depends on the size of the customer between the hardware and the software. And not surprisingly, in the small to mid-market, we are doing more with the C-levels of our customers. And then I would say the bigger the customer, the more it’s segmented across the company who is the economic buyer. Let me say something I think strategically your question unlocks is the nature of moving from selling more point solutions to selling connected offerings. Because what we do see happening as increasingly as you should make that shift from the point solution to the connected offering, you are doing more account-based selling. It is a fundamentally different approach on the go-to-market side of how we sell and who we sell to at our customers. So, historically you might have had – you could have had the virtual design and construction department deciding on some technology, then they are going to use. You can have field crew deciding which hardware machine control or survey kit they want to use out in the field. As we move to these bigger offerings, the nature of that is actually, the dollar amount becomes higher even as we move this to – from the perpetual over to a subscription basis. And we see it from the uplift when we see, when we can bring customers who are already subscribing to us and now who are taking bigger part of the portfolio, we see where we get a multiple uplift. But naturally, as those dollar uplifts go higher, we are starting very often to work with the different set of people within the organizations and within our customers. Now, that level often has already been using and been the customer at that ERP level because who is typically buying the ERP is going to be more of the CFO type who is buying that. So, now when you think about it, we are able to go to that person with the bigger offering. That’s a different sales motion for us. And so actually, we see that as a very positive thing for us, is changing the nature of the economic buyers when we are offering a solution.
Jason Celino: Well, the – I guess my quick follow-up here is the hardware weakness you are seeing. Is it mostly with the smaller customers who may not be as penetrated at Trimble, either on the hardware or software side?
Rob Painter: Oh, I see what you are asking. That’s a good question. I have to – let’s say let me think more about that and come back with a more data, a fact-based answer on that. We have been looking more at the nature of the end markets that are being served and those who do more residential work or infrastructure work. I mind you, many contractors do both kinds of work. If you are a civil contractor, you are – have to be buying more Trimble software that’s going to be set your business. If you are doing residential construction, you are doing more single-family construction, you are not buying a Trimble ERP. It’s too big for you if you are doing that kind of residential construction. By the time you are doing multifamily, there is a set of additional technology becomes more applicable. So, probably I am answering your question now as I talk about that out loud.
Jason Celino: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Tilton: Hey guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. My first question is kind of a high level one. But I think throughout the numerous answers to questions in the Q&A. You talked about the strength of the bundle that you guys have. It feels like with macro getting worse, like we hear about it in other software sectors, but now is the time when customers want to go all in on the bundle and kind of to achieve their software goals, save some money and drive an ROI. So, I guess my question is like why aren’t we seeing that offset some of the other weakness a little bit more? And maybe when should investors expect to see maybe the environment benefit demand for the attractive bundle that you guys sell?
David Barnes: Hi Josh, it’s David. First of all, I would say that we are seeing that in the software business where Rob mentioned the 30%-plus bookings in our construction software business, ARR is still really strong, growing at 20%. So, that business is benefiting from the clear path to value and Rob mentioned labor constraints that our construction customers have and software technology being needed. The hardware side is more – I will point out within B&I, our hardware is sold to civil contractors, so it’s a more narrow range of customers then buy our software. And the sale of our hardware for that segment is driven by, to use Rob’s, moving dirt. And while the infrastructure dollars are going up, if you take the inflation and back that out, labor and materials cost inflation, the actual amount of dirt being moved has not risen much over time, and that’s the fundamental driver of our B&I hardware business. So, the demand of the actual – for technology to moving the earth isn’t – hasn’t grown as much as we had anticipated. But the need for productivity has grown and our software offerings are geared to meet that need, and that’s where we are seeing the growth.
Rob Painter: And Josh, just as it plays into seeing it, I think you are also asking about playing into the full Trimble financial model. One point of reference is after we announced the AGCO joint venture, when we said pro forma going forward, we would be over 70% software and 55% recurring. So, the law of the math I think should start to play through a little bit more as well.
Joshua Tilton: Super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, I wanted to maybe to the extent that you guys can provide it, just any more color you can give us on the churn in the Mobility segment. It feels like when we talked about it in the past, it felt more like it was isolated to that specific order and now maybe it’s feeling just a tad more structural. Any more detail you guys can provide us there?
Rob Painter: I would say not structural. It would be – that would be the answer on the mobility churn.
Joshua Tilton: No problem. Thank you.
Operator: In the interest of time, our final question today comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Clarke Jeffries: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. In interest of time, I will keep it to one. I think David may have answered a part of this, but I wanted to kind of further clarify. When you think about the B&I portfolio and the relationship between dollar growth in moving dirt, is it fair to say that a lot of the ARR products, you can still capture opportunity when projects are going through engineering and procurement, but stop at that shovel ready stage due to the input costs. I wanted to understand as we think about maybe the next 12 months and the cyclical factors in construction, ARR versus hardware and whether if more projects come into this sort of paradigm, what part of the portfolio might outperform?
Rob Painter: I would expect broad outperformance really across the board on the ARR side of the business from the feasibility work to the design, to the engineering, to the procurement, through the earthmoving itself, the software aspects of that, that are involved in that and through the operations and maintenance. So, the overall dollar amount of work is there.
Operator: This does bring us to the end of our Q&A session for today. I would like to thank our speakers for the presentation, and thank you all for joining us. This now concludes today’s conference. Enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Maria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Second Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Painter, please go ahead.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Let's begin on slide 2 with our key messages. Annualized recurring revenue is our key top line metric at Trimble. Our team, led by our construction software group, achieved 14% organic growth in the quarter, beating our internal expectations by 100 basis points. We now stand at a record $1.88 billion of ARR, which compares to $1.2 billion when we began our Connect and Scale journey in 2020. ARR has doubled since 2018 and tripled since 2015. We are on track to achieve $2 billion of ARR by the end of the year, a remarkable figure made possible by the Trimble team who continues to work incredibly hard to execute on our customer-driven systems, process and business model transformation. We delivered EBITDA margin of 25.3%, also slightly ahead of our expectations, which was driven by strong gross margin of 64.2%. For perspective, gross margin was 56.8% in 2015 and 58% in 2018. EPS at $0.64 and year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate to net income of nearly 100% demonstrates the power and potential of our asset-light business model. Our revenue beat in the quarter is attributable to delivering a large federal government order in the geospatial business in the second quarter instead of the third quarter. For the year, we are holding our revenue guidance and raising EPS. Moving to slide 3. Let's look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments, beginning with Buildings & Infrastructure. The market backdrop remains generally favorable. In North America, we see strength in infrastructure and non-residential construction. Customer backlogs remain healthy and technology helps to address the skilled worker shortage. By the numbers, ACV bookings accelerated on a sequential basis, and we achieved a record level of bookings in the quarter. ARR grew over 20%. Our Trimble Construction One offering is achieving higher win rates, larger deal sizes and shorter sales cycles. Further, it is helping to grow both new logo and cross-sell bookings. We are confident in our ability to maintain momentum as our most recent release of digital systems upgrades provides significantly enhanced visibility to even further drive cross-sell and upsell. Strategically, we are pivoting more of our hardware offerings to adopt aspects of the subscription business model. For example, in building construction layout, our RI layout instrument is only available as a subscription. In civil construction, we have shifted more value to the software on the systems offering, thereby positioning us to reduce the upfront cost of a system and monetize over the life of the customer. In geospatial, the market backdrop is largely the same as buildings and infrastructure, yet serving a more highly penetrated customer base. By the numbers, revenue was well ahead of our internal expectations in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand from US state departments of transportation. And in the quarter, our team delivered the aforementioned federal government order. Strategically speaking, we saw ARR growth in our Trimble Catalyst product line. Catalyst offers precision positioning-as-a-service through a subscription offering. We passed the milestone this quarter with over 10,000 cumulative units shipped. We also expanded our product line in the reality capture space with the launch of our X9 scanner. We see reality capture as an important product category as it creates a key linkage between the physical and digital worlds, which we can uniquely serve. In Resources and Utilities, farmer sentiment has been trending negative despite market fundamentals such as commodity prices, largely continuing to be healthy. Our strategic focus in agriculture continues to be building out our aftermarket channel to gain dealer and customer intimacy, thereby providing farmers choice in their technology platforms. While revenue was down as expected, ARR grew at a double-digit rate. Our Positioning Services business continues to win customers in both on-road and off-road capacities, demonstrating our ability to innovate in the space of positioning technologies after 45 years in the business. We also took strategic steps to further ongoing ARR growth. In Forestry, we launched a cloud-based log inventory and management system that enables us to move down market, thereby expanding the addressable market. And in Utilities, the team delivered two of the largest software bookings in the history of the business. In Transportation, the market backdrop remains challenging with the soft freight market pressuring carriers to streamline their operations for cost savings to increase asset utilization and to increase the productivity of their nondriver workforce. Against this backdrop, the overall business both increased operating income margin for six consecutive quarters and grew organic ARR for the seventh consecutive quarter. In Europe, in our Transporeon business, we see early indications that the spot market might have bottomed out. Despite a difficult economic backdrop in Europe, churn is effectively zero, competitive win rates increased and the business is demonstrating an ability to manage the cost structure in line with the revenue environment. We have early examples of success with bringing the organizations together and making some product road map decisions to streamline product development work. Moving to Slide 4. Connect and Scale is a platform strategy, which in turn is fundamentally a vertical industry data strategy. No surprise then that we have been deploying artificial intelligence across Trimble for some time now, both for internal benefits and customer-facing applications. For example, a trial program with over 200 engineers using AI-assisted programming demonstrated upwards of 25% improvement in productivity. We have also extended AI into our sales process, where we are applying AI to the cost scripts of our sales reps to coach them and then further, again, to identify cross-sell opportunities. On the customer-facing front, we are improving our best-in-class positioning accuracy in harsh environments using AI-based error modeling and machine learning on many years of atmospheric data. We are deploying AI and video intelligence solutions in transportation to detect driver fatigue and distraction and for selective spraying applications in agriculture. In our construction software business, we are automating invoices by converting PDF data into usable accounts payable data. We've already processed over 350,000 invoices worth over $1 billion, compelling use cases and we are just beginning. Let me now turn the call over to David, to take us through the numbers.
David Barnes: Turning now to slide 5 second quarter revenue of $994 million grew three percent organically. Revenue was above our expectations coming into the quarter, driven by the earlier-than-expected shipment of the large order of Geospatial equipment to the Federal Government that Rob mentioned earlier. Excluding that, revenues for the quarter were in-line with our projections. Our total company revenue growth versus prior year was driven by recurring software, both organic and from the addition of Transporeon. Gross margins were strong again in the second quarter, with non-GAAP gross margins of 64.2% tying the record levels of the first quarter. Our gross margins in the second quarter reflect favorable price/cost dynamics, strong growth of recurring software revenues and a higher margin mix within our product offerings. EBITDA margin of 25.3% in the second quarter was up 110 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from our strong gross margin performance. Operating and EBITDA margins continue to grow versus prior year, even as we lap strong year-ago revenues and as we continue to invest in our digital transformation. Cash flow in the second quarter improved on a year-over-year basis even taking into account Transporeon deal-related expenses. Our improved cash flow performance was the result of lower purchases of inventory, lower tax payments, and higher profitability. Our capital allocation priority remains debt repayment. And we made progress through the quarter on reducing our leverage. Turning now to, slide 6 for some additional color on our revenue performance. Product revenue, which includes both hardware and perpetual software, was down 5% organically in the second quarter and was aided by the federal order, which we had previously expected to ship in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline in product revenue this quarter reflects a difficult comparison with the second quarter of 2022, when our supply chain was freeing up and we were working through high hardware backlog. As expected, dealers reduced their inventories in the quarter. We expect some modest amount of additional dealer inventory reduction over the balance of this year. Our subscription and services revenue, which includes SaaS, term licenses, maintenance and support, recurring transactions and professional services, was up 13% on an organic basis, largely driven by strong bookings and net retention performance across our Buildings and Infrastructure software businesses. From a geographic perspective, revenues in North America, Asia Pacific and the Rest of World were up organically, by 3%, 11% and 18% respectively. Rest of World revenue growth was driven by strong demand for precision agriculture products from customers in Brazil. Revenues in Europe declined organically by 4%, as adverse macroeconomic factors impacted many of our businesses. Turning now to results by segment on slide 7, our software portfolio in the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment, continued to perform well, with organic ARR growth of over 20%. Bookings of recurring software offerings in the segment grew at a mid-20s percentage rate, despite the challenges of transitioning the North American software businesses onto our new digital infrastructure during the quarter. These large system implementations are never easy, but our teams powered through the transition, while still keeping our growth momentum going. With this latest release of our digital transformation, we now have over one-third of our Buildings and Infrastructure ARR, transacting through a connected system, which will facilitate the acceleration of our Connect and Scale strategy. Segment revenues of products for civil construction customers were down at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, reflecting strong shipment momentum a year ago. In the Geospatial reporting segment, we experienced organic revenue growth driven by the $18 million shipment to the federal government mentioned earlier. Excluding this one shipment, segment revenues in the quarter were down at a mid-single-digit organic rate, an improvement from the performance in the first quarter. This segment is most impacted by the downturn in residential home construction in North America and Europe. We expect to return to organic growth on an ongoing basis in the fourth quarter. In the Resources and Utilities segment, revenues were down year-on-year and fell modestly short of our expectations, driven by our agriculture business. While our sales to ag OEM customers grew versus prior year in the second quarter, revenue from our aftermarket channel was down. Three drivers help contextualize the aftermarket revenue decline. One, we are lapping a tough comp versus 2022 when our revenues surged as our supply chain freed up well ahead of the OEM supply chain. Second, the changes we announced a quarter ago and our aftermarket distribution network have, as expected, impacted our short-term revenue trends as we and our dealers refine our plans going forward. And third, we are seeing the impact from a softening of farmer sentiment, especially in Europe. We continue to see strong demand trends from ag customers in Brazil, and our positioning services business grew globally at a double-digit rate as we accelerated our cross-sell efforts. In the Transportation segment, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by our North American Enterprise and Maps businesses. Our Mobility businesses in Europe and Brazil also grew revenue and ARR at a double-digit rate. As Rob mentioned earlier, operating margins improved sequentially once again. Our Trimble transportation team has made good progress in turning this business around. And while there's more work ahead of us, we are pleased with the progress. I'll note here that segment results now include the Transporeon business. Transporeon performance was largely in line with our expectations for the quarter, notwithstanding a tough macro environment in the European transportation industry. Moving now to Slide 8. We ended the second quarter with ARR of $1.88 billion, up 14% organically. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, our backlog, stood at $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter. RPO related to recurring offerings grew by over $100 million year-over-year as a result of our strong bookings performance. Product RPO came down as expected year-over-year, reflecting our improved lead times. With this high level of RPO, we have significant visibility into our revenue in the coming quarters. On a 12-month rolling basis, our software services and recurring revenue of $2.3 billion represents a record 64% of our revenues, up 800 basis points from year ago levels. We completed the acquisition of Transporeon in the second quarter and reduced net debt by $150 million from the closing of the acquisition through quarter end. We plan to continue to delever, and as anticipated, expect to finish the year with net debt less than 3x EBITDA. Turning now to our guidance on Slide 9. The midpoint of our guidance for full year revenue remains the same as we issued last quarter. Our revenue guidance range has narrowed to $3.845 billion to $3.925 billion, which represents organic revenue growth in the second half of the year in the mid- to high single digits. We continue to expect ARR to grow at a mid-teens rate for the year. Our expectation for gross and operating margins has increased from prior guidance by 50 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the second quarter and highly focus on margins and cost control. The end result is an increase in the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range by $0.03. We now expect full year EPS in the range of $2.57 to $2.73. From a segment perspective, our expectation for full year growth in the Buildings and Infrastructure segment has improved following strong performance in the second quarter. Our forecast in Resources and Utilities is down modestly from the outlook of a quarter ago, reflecting weakening macroeconomic conditions in the agriculture sector. The outlook for Transportation and Geospatial is unchanged from last quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 0% to 5%, which corresponds with a revenue range of $945 million to $985 million. We expect gross margins of 100 to 150 basis points lower than the second quarter, reflecting a less favorable business mix. We expect third quarter operating margins will be similar to second quarter levels. We project EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.64. From a segment perspective, we expect Geospatial revenues to be down organically at a mid-to-high single-digit rate as we won't have the positive impact of the large federal order this coming quarter. Resources and Utilities revenue is expected to be down at a mid-single digit organically. Revenue in Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation are expected to continue to grow organically in the third quarter at rates comparable to or better than we experienced in the second quarter. Back to you, Rob.
Rob Painter: The Trimble operating system links strategy, people and execution with a belief set that we must strive for excellence across all three dimensions. The progress of the quarter represents the quality of the strategy and our ability to execute. I'll close with comments on people. In the quarter, we won a number of culture awards, reinforcing our ability to attract the best talent in the industry. We believe that part of attracting the best lies in developing the best talent of the future. Through our Trimble Labs initiative, we now sponsor 30 technology labs in 14 countries. We also believe in the health of our communities. In the quarter, we announced breaking ground on a 1.7 megawatt solar array as a renewable energy source at our headquarters, and our own technology is currently being utilized to increase the productivity and quality of this installation. Finally, let me take a moment to acknowledge that Steve Berglund retired from our Board of Directors, completing over 24 years of service at Trimble. We thank Steve for all of his contributions, dedication and years of service to the company. Borje Ekholm will Chair our Board of Directors through our next phase of growth. Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.
Kristen Owen: Hi. Good morning thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a nice result. I was wondering if we could maybe start by just some of the moving pieces in Resources and Utilities. David, I think you called out this three items, but wondering if you can help us parse out sort of the macro from the distribution channel, what you're seeing in underlying demand there? And then walk us through how that transition is unfolding in the distribution channel?
David Barnes: Sure. Hi Kristen. First thing I'll point out is that our business with the OEMs was up. So that's the good part of the story. The factors that I mentioned that caused our aftermarket business to be down year-on-year, a part of it is the macros. We see softening sentiment across many of the geographies is much more pronounced in Europe than the rest of the world, but we really see it in Europe. We've also changed our -- made announcement of changes to our distribution network. And so that's causing us and our dealers to sort of rethink our plans, and that clearly had a softening effect in the quarter. And then, we're just lapping really big numbers. Last year, we had really strong shipments as we were working through our supply chain. I'll point out our supply chain improved much more quickly than the OEMs. They get a lot more parts, more complex supply chain. So we saw the surge last year. It's a little tough to attribute, the causal nature of the aftermarket revenue decline to those three. It is a mix, and some of them are interrelated. But I think overall, the sort of long-term outlook remains positive, just as it was. We see these as -- all three of these factors is reasonably temporal.
Kristen Owen: Okay. Thank you. And just to clarify, on the transition in the distribution network, just any thoughts on how that is playing out at this point and how we should think about the impact from that transition over the remainder of the year?
Rob Painter: Hey Kristen. Good morning, it's Rob. The transition is playing out mostly as expected. So, we feel good about where we are in this. It's obviously a process as we go around the globe, but we take an 80-20 principle as we work with our partners around the world from those that we're signing up. Thus far, I think there's very positive sentiment. This creates a closer connection to Trimble. It gets a broader portfolio of technology to take to market. So we're feeling good about it where we are, and there's still clearly a lot of work to be done. So I'd say, largely as expected so far.
Kristen Owen: That's super helpful. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about a comment that you made regarding the positioning services. Can you just remind us what is your market share in positioning services today as we think about maybe specific to RNU just given the cross-selling opportunities that you called out there? Just trying to think about what the overall TAM is just given your market penetration? And I'll stop there. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Yes, this has been an extraordinarily successful business for us really for the last couple of -- I can argue in the last couple of decades. To get that 2-centimeter and less accuracy on a farm or for a survey or for construction equipment, by the way, for ADAS systems and on-road vehicles, you need to have corrections, because you have errors in the atmosphere, you need additional geometry -- ground-based geometry to augment the satellites. So we've been a market leader, a technology leader in this capability for a long time now, continue to actually find ability to innovate in this space. From a market share perspective, I'd say it's pretty clear, we're the market leader as our technology goes on in ag, it goes civil construction equipment and machine control, it shows up in surveying all places where we have the market share lead. So the correlation on to Trimble equipment correlates to the market share we have, I'd say, and beyond because you don't just have to be Trimble on Trimble and we are mixed fleet. On the on-road space, that became a new frontier, let's say, a new addressable market that opened up for us in the last few years as automotive companies start towards their path -- towards autonomy. It's a series of progressive automation. That's why you see ADAS picking up as one of the first applications. So to no absolute position for lane detection, you're going to need to have corrections like we have. So, that's an emerging market with -- that presents an expanded addressable market for us. In terms of actually sizing specifically the addressable market, I have to admit it's a bit hard to do that, but I would put it as a certainly approaching $1 billion type market opportunity when you put the on-road business in as well.
Kristen Owen: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi, good morning everyone.
Rob Painter : Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich : Rob, I'm wondering if you could just share a bit more of the stats for the subscription businesses. I know you have a very tight pipeline process, particularly in B&I, can you just talk about what the pipeline looks like? And any comments that you can add on Transporeon's performance beyond the prepared remarks in terms of what the lead indicators look like in that item business? And if you're willing to touch on new logo growth for the subscription assets within the performance, we would appreciate it? Thanks.
Rob Painter : Sure, Jerry. So the pipeline within construction is quite strong. This team is firing on all cylinders at the moment. It showed up in the organic ARR growth greater than 20%, which is clearly better than the company number at the plus 14% level organically. Bookings were grew faster than the ARR growth. Bookings grew sequentially. You'd asked me about that last quarter. So now you work backwards from the bookings and into the pipeline and the coverage ratios, and we like what we see. We see strong pipeline, strong coverage ratios, the Trimble construction one offering continues to get momentum for our sellers in the market. We see strong cross-sell activity within those bookings as the pieces come together quite nice and overlay the market backdrop on that, and infrastructure in North America is clearly a positive catalyst for us in all of the markets. So generally, a favorable macro meets a team executing extremely well and turns into a pipeline, which turns into that ARR. On the Transporeon side of the house, we're four months into the acquisition. So it's still relatively new. We like what we're seeing in the business so far. So as I think about the people, I think about the macros, I think about the business and I think about the integration opportunities that we have there. Now the macro is still more challenging in Europe. It's a mass micro monetization business model. So it's fundamentally transaction-based or consumption-based and then the nature of the mix of that consumption impacts the revenue. What we think we saw in the quarter is that it looks like spot prices might have hit a bottom and time will tell. If that's the case, then the business model is there and poised to increase accordingly. From a customer perspective, from wins in the market, we don't lose customers in this business. We did have new logo wins in the quarter, continue to have bookings growth in the quarter. So I like the start that we have in the business.
Jerry Revich: Super. Thank you for the detail color. And David, can I ask on the fourth quarter revenue outlook growth, really interesting, so essentially an acceleration in sales of about three points ahead of normal seasonality, 4Q versus 3Q. Can you just unpack what gives you that confidence because Caterpillar is cutting production and we've got a bit of different trends in some of your hardware markets? I'm wondering if you could just talk about the visibility that you have because that element of your guide looks pretty interesting.
David Barnes: Yeah, sure. Jerry, one thing I'll say is that if you compare Trimble's trends with the OEMs, you have to keep in mind the year-on-year comps, including channel inventory, which are completely different for us. We work through our supply chain issues. In early last year, we saw the surge of shipment. Our channel inventories have been declining. That's not true for all the OEMs. The way I get comfort on the fourth quarter is from a couple of directions. First, from the bottom-up look at the businesses, the pipeline, the underlying trends. And then from a top-down perspective, I look at comparisons of our projections with the period before COVID in the supply chain. If you actually look at our organic growth going back to four years ago, so which is pre these disruptions. Actually, the fourth quarter compound organic growth is very comparable to Q3 and is actually consistent with what we've seen for several quarters. So it looks like a ramp-up, but when you take the noise of the supply chain-driven ups and downs from a year or two ago, it looks very achievable. So we're very confident in this fourth quarter outlook.
Jerry Revich: Super. Thank you.
Operator: Our next call comes from Mr. Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Chad Dillard: Hi. Good morning guys. So I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more into the hardware business. Can you just talk about segment by segment, what you're seeing in terms of the year-on-year slowdown? And then also, can you talk about the progress of destocking, to what extent do you think you're going to be finished and when you think you'd be able to produce in line with retail demand?
David Barnes: Hey, Chad. First thing I'd say is that we're nearly all the way through the destocking. It won't be a meaningful factor for the back half of the year. There was some destocking in Q2. It was much smaller than Q1, so I don't really call that out as a major driver. But there's a -- it's not just the destocking this year. It was the increase in inventory levels last year that you're comparing against. So you've got to put those two together to compare our business trends with retail demand. And that's true across the markets we serve. From the segment perspective, the business where we think there has been some end user sales to retail or sales end user decline is in geospatial. That is the segment that is most impacted by residential construction, both in the United States and Europe. So that's been the softest. If you take the channel dynamics out both this year and last and the other businesses in ag and in civil construction, it looks like there's modest sales to retail growth even with the numbers we're posting. So that's kind of how we see it.
Chad Dillard: That's helpful. And then I wanted to hit on your digital transformation. Can you just talk about how that's progressing? I think you talked about B&I, about 30 of your products are being sold this way. Maybe you can talk also about just what you've learned so far with that one-third of that business segment being transformed?
David Barnes: Yes. So we got through the next phase of our digital transformation during Q2. We put our North American construction enterprise software businesses together on a common digital platform. And as I said in my prepared remarks, these big process and system changes are never easy, they can be disruptive. One of the things I'm most proud of with our team and our results is that we achieved nearly mid-20s-plus -- actually, and the businesses directly impacted by the digital transformation, almost 30% bookings growth, while the tools they use to track and sell have transformed. So that is a huge milestone. It's -- we are now in a position, only just now, to take advantage of the benefits that the common platform provides to us and further enhancements to that are going to roll out even this quarter. So we're getting to the point where cross-sell and the Connect and Scale vision is enabled and not hindered by diversity of systems. Now we have common technology. We have visibility into our pipeline. Salespeople can see what customer business is across the Trimble portfolio in ways that they couldn't systematically before. So we're just getting going. We're just beginning to realize the potential of this new process and tool for that business, and we will continue over the next year or two to roll out the same approach to the rest of our business.
Chad Dillard: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to start with TC1. And can you maybe give us a little bit of additional color in terms of how this is maybe impacting your ability to transact with customers as well as where TC1 maybe has surprised you?
Rob Painter: Hey, Jonathan. Good morning. It's Rob. The TC1 so far has been, I'd say, a large success, and I think we're just getting started with it. I've had an example of a customer saying, okay, I used to have to have 14 different transactions with you to do business and now I can do it under one frame agreement. We're making ourselves easier to do business with. When we sign a frame agreement, let's say, with a customer who maybe is only buying one solution within TC1, if you sign the frame agreement, it's now easier to upsell. So that land and expand is more easily enabled because you don't have to go back and with a set of terms and conditions. Customers are able to connect workflows as we have tighter and tighter integrations in the data across the products and solutions that we sell to customers. So any surprise within TC1 to me as to the upside, it absolutely validates Connect and Scale and as the beacon for the rest of the company of what we can do when we rethink how we go to market and how we take our solutions to market. So I was very encouraged with what we're seeing in the business and proud of the team that's delivering it.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And you also mentioned AI during the prepared remarks. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of how this could be a potential driver of revenue, the timeframes for that as well as on the productivity side? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Certainly, let's split the two and then the slide that goes along with the prepared remarks that we made on purpose, put one distinction of the internal facing example separate from the customer-facing examples. So if we take the productivity opportunity internally, I think the place we'll see it show up first is within the R&D on the developer side with the copilot trial that we ran in the second quarter that showed some productivity benefits. I think this is going to be the way that business has done. So where I would like to believe that, we'll see this show up over time as we can get more scalability out of the resources we have. Said another way is, if this works, that turns into op leverage on revenue growth that we have in the future. So call it more scalability, more effectiveness -- and internal effectiveness and efficiency, which I think would ultimately manifest in op leverage or that marginal contribution on the revenue growth. On the customer-facing side, I think it's going to be very interesting to see how this monetizes over time. Right now, I would say, there's an aspect where we make the solutions we sell better. Trimble is a premium price provider in the market. I think this is part of earning that premium is continuing to innovate and develop and have the best. There's another aspect of capabilities, which we believe will come through when you're buying a bundle such as TC1 when you're buying that platform offering or that cloud offering, such that if you have a, I'll say, an incremental set of analytics capabilities, we want to deliver them when you're buying something like TC1, so where you can uniquely get them by virtue of that business model. I suspect that that's going to be the way that we'll see this monetize. I think standalone analytics, I have a question if those will actually be able to monetize independently and on their own. I really think it comes through making our solutions better.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. So on Trimble Construction One, can you give us some color on what percent of your B&I customers now have TC1 and using multiple solutions on it? And do you have any set goal or timeframe to convert a certain percent of the customer base into TC1 customers?
Rob Painte: Hi, Tami, good morning, it's Rob. Let's take that in here slices within B&I. Within B&I, you know, we have the civil construction -- fundamentally, we have the civil construction business, machine control, as you would know it, and then the construction software. Within the civil construction business, we don't -- we really don't have TC1 today, but that is absolutely where we're going. It's connecting the machine control offering with the software. We do that informally today, like that's the path we'll for sure be going. So I'd say we're not fundamentally doing it in the civil space today. So there would be no customers that we're hitting there. Within the construction software business that we have, this is for sure where we're taking the business and where we're having success. I have one caveat within that, which is our SketchUp product in our architecture and design business because SketchUp has millions of users from makers to architects. And so it's a different market segment. So I don't think that the millions of users of SketchUp are going to all be relevant for TC1. So if I take it within the subset the construction software, we would have an ambition to have, it's well more than half of our customer base on the Trimble Construction One agreement. We've got many thousands of customers on the frame agreements today. The team does a great job even if somebody is not buying a full bundled opportunity that they're putting them on the frame -- customers on the frame agreement such that they have a path to have access to more of our solutions and to have more of those more easily. So I hope that gives you a little color on how we think about the TC1 opportunity within B&I. What we'll continue to do, I guess I'll have a little bit more Tami, is our sweet spot today is at that contractor level with the TC1 offering, then we look at an architecture and engineering experience for TC1. We look at a civil contractor experience for TCI. So I have a series of expansions through tailoring experiences to the customer segments that we serve and then actually also rolling this out on a global basis. So overall, we're still in the early innings, and that's good news in terms of the continued growth opportunity.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful color, Rob. Thank you. And my follow-up question is the price cost benefit in the quarter that you saw that helped gross margin, can you quantify how much it was and what segments drove that?
Rob Painter: Yes. I mean just to give you a little higher level color on that for the moment. So the qualitative before quantitative. On the qualitative side, the gross margin improvement is fundamentally about the mix of the software business. So this isn't a price, I'll say, a price-driven benefit where we also see benefit in the margin as from the cost abating the inflation coming down in the supply chain, purchase price variance is going down or going away. So that means the hardware businesses are returning to increase their gross margins, by and large. You put that on top of selling more software, which comes naturally with a higher gross margin, and you get that 64.2% gross margin, which was a time of record we had from Q1 and is a remarkable change from gross margins of the past at Trimble. So it's more -- much more driven by that than price.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead. 
Rob Mason: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could -- speaking to maybe the B&I and geospatial areas collectively, could you segment out what you're seeing between infrastructure and trends in non-res construction? And then just with respect to residential construction, do you think you're at a point of stabilization there?
Rob Painter: Hi, Rob. Good morning. If we look at the segments within the market, clearly, infrastructure is the strong point, both, I'd say, North America, but also globally. There's also mega projects happening around the world and those are positives for us. On the, I'll say, the non-res side, if I exclude infrastructure non-res where we see pockets of -- continue to see pockets of strength and if I think here in North America, I think about renewable energy projects, we think about some onshoring of manufacturing, data centers, which correlates to AI, we believe, those are areas where we're seeing strength. And residential specifically, there's a little bit of a mixed tail. There's still a fair amount of new homebuilding happening, I'll stay within the US here for a bit on residential. But -- and so we see sort of up and down trends on that. I mean, it's been net down on residential, for sure. And hopefully, we can get to some stabilization on that. I don't know that I would call it stabilized yet in North America. But the economy looks like we might be able to head for us if we had for that soft landing, then that would be a good thing. Residential has been harder in Europe and then, that one have much more of a challenge than the US, and that's worth calling out. So you put the sum of that all together, and you get the forecast what -- we get the results that we have and the forecast that we put going forward.
Rob Mason: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, David, you did -- I know we just had the discussion around gross margin. But David, you did speak to some -- that steps down in the third quarter. Should we expect that it steps back up in the fourth the mix becomes more favorable again?
David Barnes: Yeah, Rob, it will -- it's mostly mix driven, both the dynamics from Q1 to Q2 and then Q2 for the rest of the year. We do expect it to step down in Q3 and then up again modestly in Q4 driven by more software mix in the business.
Rob Mason: Very good. Thank you.
David Barnes: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Devin Au with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Devin Au: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about your construction software business as well, really strong results there. I think one of our competitors reported yesterday and saw churn maybe up-tick slightly. But I'm just curious, if you've seen any similar dynamics around churn in the quarter, any noticeable up-tick or downtick? And if you can also comment on how retention or NRR has trended from last quarter that would be helpful?
David Barnes: Yeah. The -- in our construction software businesses across the board, we're seeing very strong demand. So as Rob mentioned earlier, the pipeline is strong. We've seen no up-tick in churn and net retention trends are really good. So the fundamental subscription metrics look very solid across our construction software business.
Devin Au: Got it. No, that's great to hear. And then, a quick follow-up for me, as you mentioned the closing of a large federal government order in geospatial, any details on how large that deal is? I just want to get more color on how much revenue got pulled forward from 3Q into 2Q? Thank you.
David Barnes: It was just a touch over $18 million geospatial equipment for the federal government.
Devin Au: Thank you.
David Barnes: You're welcome.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-03 09:40:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Trimble First Quarter 2023 Results Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I’d now like to welcome Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer to begin the conference. Rob, over to you.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Let's begin on Slide 2 with our key messages. Annualized recurring revenue is our key top line metric at Trimble. Our team led by our construction software group achieved 13% organic growth in the quarter, 100 basis points ahead of our expectations.  We now stand at 1.65 billion of ARR, which compares to 1.2 billion when we began our Connect and Scale journey in 2020 and under 700 million at the beginning of 2017. Kudos to the Trimble team who have worked so hard to execute on our transformation. EBITDA is our other key P&L metric, and we delivered EBITDA of 27.2%, also slightly ahead of our expectations, which was driven by record gross margins of 64.2%. For perspective, gross margins in 2019 were 57.7% and 56.3% in 2016. Free cash flow conversion of 1.14x was also ahead of our expectations. I recognize that consensus numbers and the trading algorithm both still focus on total revenue and EPS. While these figures are important, they are secondary in relevance to ARR and cash flow, which are much more closely tied to fundamental value creation. Revenue and margins were both above expectations we set with the investor community back in February. We believe the delta to consensus figures was simply a function of the challenge in getting our quarters mapped correctly against our annual guidance. As a result, we will be more prescriptive with our second quarter commentary. With respect to the macro, like most companies, we are navigating an economic environment with a heightened sense of uncertainty trying to find the signal through the noise. Despite the noise, what we sell to customers is productivity, quality, safety, transparency, and environmental sustainability. The mid-to-long term secular tailwinds remain strong in the industries we serve. They are large global industries that are underserved and underpenetrated and they will continue to digitally transform. Our strategy compels us to be mindful of our cost structure in the short-term, while continuing to invest in our most attractive long-term opportunities. With respect to capital allocation, there are three main points. First, we divested three small businesses in the first quarter, bringing the total to 16 since 2020. Second, our recent B2W and Ryvit deals are both off to a strong start and performing ahead of expectations. Third, the investment we are making in our business transformation has initially been focused towards our software businesses. 1.65 billion of ARR growing double-digit in this climate as a proof point of high quality capital allocation. We are transforming our go to market motions to deliver bundled and connected solutions, while building the systems and processes to efficiently and effectively scale our business. At the company level, we think about our Rule of 40 as the sum of ARR growth and EBITDA margin, which represents our aspirational bar. Many of our software businesses have already cleared this hurdle, while others are steering this direction. Looking at our hardware businesses, this is where we have felt the whipsaw of supply chain availability and channel inventory stabilization, which continues to make quarterly comparisons of our numbers incomplete at best. To find the signal, you have to look at a multi-year view. Our largest hardware businesses and agriculture civil construction and geospatial, collectively grew revenues at a mid-single-digit rate from the first quarter of 2019 through the quarter of 2023. In the first quarter, channel inventories continued to draw down, thus retail demand significantly exceeded wholesale demand. Moving to Slide 3, let's look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments beginning with buildings and infrastructure. Market backdrop generally remains healthy. In North America, we see strength in infrastructure and non-residential construction such as data centers, renewable energy, and manufacturing, slightly offset by pressure on residential. Customer backlogs remain healthy and technology helps to address the skilled worker shortage. By the numbers, ACB bookings grew double-digits in the quarter and ahead of plan, while ARR grew in excess of the company growth rate. Our Trimble Construction One commercial offering is helping to grow new logo and cross-sell bookings and our next wave of systems automation will be released in the next few weeks. Through the lens of strategic progression, customer wins at England's National Highways and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration demonstrate customers want integrated Trimble offerings. At CONEXPO, our technology was present on 20 OEM booths, demonstrating the continued relevance of the mix fleet. In our introduction of an all-in-one system for on machine excavator guidance insight serving, demonstrates that we can continue to expand the size of the addressable market by virtue of reaching new machine categories. In geospatial, the market backdrop is generally the same as buildings and infrastructure with a higher mix of residential exposure, which presents a headwind. Managing channel inventory levels is a priority in this segment. By the numbers, revenue was ahead of our internal expectations in the quarter. Strategically speaking, we continue to see strong demand from U.S. State Department of Transportation and we see product lines such as mobile mapping showing solid growth. In resources and utilities, while farmer sentiment has been dropping, the market fundamentals continue to be healthy. Commodity prices remain high by historical standards and input costs are moderating. Strategically speaking, we are on the path towards building out our aftermarket distribution and agriculture. We believe in giving farmers a choice in their technology platforms and we believe in the power of independent technology dealers where we have the direct relationship. While there's a lot of work ahead of us, feedback from current and prospective partners is positive, We know how to build and manage a channel that reference our SITECH model in civil construction and a similar initiative in our geospatial channel as case studies and excellence of channel development. In the quarter, we also announced advanced path planning technology, which takes us a step further on the path toward fully autonomous equipment for a variety of industries. In our positioning services business, we announced that Nissan has gone live with the most advanced driver assist system to date, which is enabled by Trimble positioning technology. This is another example of Connect and Scale, taking a core Trimble technology and applying it across new and existing verticals. By the numbers, we were largely unplanned this quarter. In transportation, the market backdrop is very dynamic with a softening freight market pressuring carriers to find new frontiers of efficiency which technology can help address. By the numbers, we met our expectations in the quarter and we have delivered five sequential quarterly increases and operating income as a percent of revenue. Strategically speaking, we are making progress with our new In-Cab technology platform, which delivers the open platform that our customers have been asking for. We launched new functionality in the quarter, including the first industry dwell time metrics for fleet management, which provides customers with additional metrics they can use to improve their operational efficiency. The biggest news for us in transportation was closing of the Transporeon deal on April 3. I've described this business as a perfect example of a platform play within our strategy. The why, comes in the form of a network of over 158,000 carriers and over 1,400 shippers transacting approximately €55 billion of freight on an annual basis. Every day, over 110,000 transports and over 100,000 docs scheduling appointments are managed on the Transporeon platform. Slide 4 provides a summary overview of how we see the complementary aspects coming together to create a stronger franchise. In the form of complementary capabilities, customers, and geographic reach. The business model of Transporeon is fundamentally a consumption based model based on an array of transaction fees. Since we announced the deal in December, demand in Europe has slowed. And the mix has shifted towards a greater percentage of contract over spot transactions, which are monetized at a lower rate. Our guidance reflects what we believe is a de-risked 2023 level of dollar denominated revenue, approximately 10% below what we communicated in December. While this is disappointing there are also positive signals. Bookings are still expected to grow well over 30% for the year. Market share is holding, customer churn is almost non-existent and our tax rate assumption improved and cross-selling opportunities with Trimble are looking stronger than they did just a few months ago. Let me now turn the call over to David to take us through the numbers.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. I'll start on Slide 5. First quarter revenue of 915 million was above our expectations coming into the quarter. I'll remind you that revenues were exceptionally strong early last year as we recovered from our supply chain challenges and worked to bring down backlog. So, our comps this quarter were difficult. Our organic revenue decline in the first quarter is entirely attributable to reductions in dealer inventories. Gross margins were exceptionally strong in the quarter. As Rob mentioned, our 64.2% gross margins are a record in the history of Trimble reflecting both an accelerated mix toward higher margin software offerings and the positive net impact of price realization and lower input costs for our hardware products. Gross margins in the first quarter benefited from a high level of term license renewals in several of our software businesses so we expect some moderation from this high level in the coming quarters. While we continued to spend in the quarter against our strategic initiatives, our strong performance on the gross margin line led to higher EBITDA and operating margins, up 170 basis points and 120 basis points respectively versus prior year. We are pleased with our ability to drive high margins even in a tough environment and as we invest in our business.  Cash flow in the quarter improved significantly year-on-year with both cash flow from operations and free cash flow in excess of non-GAAP net income. Our improved cash generation reflects a reduction in cash outflow for hardware component purchases and lower incentive compensation. Note that we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and will continue the suspension of share repurchases until we have paid down a meaningful portion of the debt raised fund the Transporeon acquisition. Turning now to Slide 6 for some perspective on the underlying drivers of our revenue trends. I'd like to call your attention to a change we have made in the presentation of our revenue breakout on our financial statements. Going forward, our revenue will be broken out in two components. The first category is products, while the second category is subscriptions and services. Product revenue consists of hardware offerings, and our non-recurring perpetual software, while subscription and services revenue is predominantly recurring. In presenting our revenue in this way, we are being responsive to investors who increasingly think of our growth separately in recurring and non-recurring revenues. We think this new presentation is better aligned with our strategy going forward. Product revenue, including hardware and perpetual software was down 15% organically in the first quarter. The decline in product revenue this quarter reflects a tough comparison with the first quarter of 2022, when our supply chain was freeing up and we were working through extraordinarily high backlog. Our dealers reduced their inventories as expected in the first quarter of this year and we estimate that dealer inventory reductions accounted for roughly 40 million or nearly half of our product revenue decline. Subscription and services revenue was up 14% on an organic basis. To put our first quarter revenue performance into a longitudinal perspective, it is instructive to look at the compound growth back to 2019 before the impacts of COVID and supply chain swings. In this view, total revenue compounded at a 5% rate in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2019. From a geographic perspective, revenue was down 9% organically in Europe. Nearly half of the Europe revenue decline can be attributed to our decision to exit our Russia business. In North America and Asia Pacific, our revenues in the quarter were essentially flat, while revenue in the rest of world grew 6% driven by strong demand from agriculture customers in Latin America. Turning now to Slide 7, we ended the first quarter with ARR at 1.65 billion, up 13% organically. Backlog of 1.6 billion was up slightly versus the prior quarter and down from 1.7 billion a year ago. Hardware and perpetual software related backlog was down 200 million year-over-year, driven by our dramatically improved lead times. Recurring related backlog was up over 100 million year-over-year and up 40 million sequentially due to our growing bookings of recurring solutions. On a 12-month rolling basis, our software services and recurring revenue of 2.2 billion represents 62% of our revenue, up 700 basis points from year ago levels. As we near the completion of the Transporeon acquisition, we did so from a strong balance sheet position with net debt at approximately 1.1x EBITDA. Turning now to results by segment on Slide 8, our software portfolio and buildings and infrastructure had a strong quarter with ARR, up organically by approximately 20%. Segment revenue to our civil construction customers, which are predominantly made up of hardware, were down year-on-year in the quarter as expected as our dealers worked down their inventories. Excluding the impact of dealer inventory changes, we estimate that our retail sales of civil construction offerings were up in the quarter at a high-single-digit rate, reflecting a favorable environment for infrastructure investment. In total, buildings and infrastructure saw 5% organic revenue growth with operating margins over 28%. Transportation segment revenues grew year-on-year organically in the quarter, while operating margins exceeded 15%. Importantly ARR grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter for this segment. The turnaround of our transportation business is underway and we are encouraged by the continuous improvement in ARR growth, revenue growth, and operating margins. In the Resources and Utilities segment, revenue was down organically as expected. Like our other hardware centric businesses, R&U revenue trends were impacted significantly by tough comps with prior. In the first quarter of 2022, R&U revenues grew 16% organically as our supply chain freed up and we worked to bring down backlog. On a [full-year basis] [ph], first quarter revenues were up at a compound annual growth rate of just over 6%. Segment margins were extremely strong in the quarter, reflecting lower input cost and the benefit of higher price realization. In the geospatial segment, which is also heavily dependent on hardware, we saw revenue down 16% on an organic basis in the quarter, but modestly better than our forecast. More than half of the year-on-year organic revenue decline for the segment relates to dealer inventory dynamics as dealers reduce their overall inventory levels this year. Geospatial revenues grew organically by over 16% in the first quarter of last year as we brought down backlog. Our geospatial business has felt the slowdown in residential home construction, which has impacted many of our survey customers. I'll now turn to guidance on Slide 9, where we have a number of moving pieces. We are updating our annual guidance to bridge the addition of Transporeon for the remainder of the year. We are also being more prescriptive with our view in the second quarter with the addition of Transporeon. Let's start with the annual outlook pre-Transporeon where we are confirming our baseline guidance view for the business, including our outlook for mid-teens organic ARR growth and full-year organic revenue growth of 2% to 5%. Incorporating Transporeon, we expect the addition of approximately 135 million in revenues over the balance of the year and approximately 175 million of ARR by the end of the year. As such, we now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of 3.835 billion to 3.935 billion. We project that our ARR, including Transporeon will be approximately 2 billion at the end of 2023. We continue to expect the gross margins will expand in the range of 300 basis points for the year versus 2022, coming down sequentially in the second quarter and then progressing up again in the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Our guidance now assumes a more favorable tax rate than our last forecast based on a more favorable outlook on our tax rate from the Transporeon acquisition. Our updated outlook for earnings per share is in the range of $2.52 to $2.72, reflecting a mid-single-digit percentage dilution from Transporeon and related interest expense, which is in-line with what we indicated in December. We continue to expect the Transporeon will be roughly neutral to 2024 EPS and accretive thereafter. We affirm our free cash flow projection for the year of approximately 1x non-GAAP net income, reflecting in part our plan to reduce inventory levels. Shortly after the close of the Transporeon acquisition, our pro forma net leverage stood at approximately 3.25x with approximately $3.1 billion in net debt. The debt we raised in connection with our Transporeon acquisition carries an interest rate of approximately 6.3%, in-line with our expectations at the time the deal was announced. Given our current cash flow projections, we expect to end 2023 with leverage under 3x. We said in our announcement of the Transporeon acquisition that we expected to restore leverage to below 2.5x within 18 months to 24 months following the acquisition. Our updated projections suggest that we will be able to de-lever to our 2.5x goal sooner than that original time line. Turning to the second quarter. The midpoint of our guidance reflects a return to organic revenue growth with revenue between $962 million and $992 million and EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.61. We expect the impact of additional dealer inventory reductions in the second quarter will be about half the rate of the first quarter with stocking levels at or near normal levels by the end of June. We expect that our gross margin percentage will be lower sequentially in the second quarter, due to lower term license revenue and a higher share of hardware. Operating margins will also be down sequentially to approximately 22%, reflecting both lower gross margins and higher operating expense from annual salary increases. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect higher rates of ARR and revenue growth. We expect revenue to increase sequentially from the second quarter through the fourth quarter. We project that the fourth quarter will be our best of the year across the key metrics of financial performance, including total revenue, ARR growth, organic revenue growth, and operating margins. As it relates to our view on segment growth throughout the rest of the year, we expect all four of our segments to post improving, sequential, organic ARR, and revenue growth through the balance of 2023. Buildings and Infrastructure will remain our fastest-growing segment as we expect our recurring software businesses to sustain solid performance while our civil hardware business improves with more normalized dealer inventories. We expect our geospatial segment to return to positive organic growth in the second half of the year, but remain modestly down for the full-year. We expect resources and utilities to return to growth late in the second half of the year, driven by an expected pickup in our aftermarket channels. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Painter: When we think about our right to win at Trimble, we believe we can uniquely bring together users and connect workflow between the physical and digital worlds across industry continuums. Connect and Scale is our strategy. Our strategy is a platform strategy. The platform strategy is in turn a data strategy. If we are successful in our pursuits, we will collect one of the most complete data sets in and across industries, creating a flywheel of enhanced insights and data connectivity. AI has captured the world's attention, ours too. We believe our corpus of industry-specific data will unlock and accelerate our long-term value creation model. As I conclude my remarks, I want to take a moment to honor the memory of Sandra MacQuillan, who passed away last week after a year's long battle with cancer. Sandra was a dedicated member of our Board and was a valuable contributor to our company's success. Sandra's insight, courage, and support for our business will be greatly missed. She helped make Trimble a better company. She helped me to become a better leader. On behalf of the entire Trimble team, I extend our deepest condolences to Sandra's family and loved ones.  Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.
Rob Painter: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering, Rob, David, maybe if you just talk about the cadence of ARR growth in Buildings and Infrastructure, it looks like that might have slowed a touch in the quarter. Can you just talk about the drivers and then your outlook for total company ARR growth is to accelerate from 13% this quarter to mid-teens the rest of the year? Can you just step through the drivers, please?
David Barnes: Sure. Jerry, it's David. There no fundamental change in the momentum of the business – recurring business in Buildings and Infrastructure. It happens to be the case that in the first quarter, that's when the term licenses renew. And so, if you're going to have churn, that's when you have it. And that factor will abate and we expect to end the year actually a little north of 20% for Buildings and Infrastructure ARR. So, the momentum is solid.
Jerry Revich: And David, is your – just to put a finer point on that. So, you're looking for an acceleration in total ARR from 13% to 15% for the full-year, just to put a finer point on that since obviously, mid-teens is a pretty wide range?
David Barnes: Yes, you're right, mid-teens. I'll try not to be too specific, but it's north of 13%. So yes, we project that ARR growth will accelerate for the balance of the year.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Super. And can I ask on Transporeon. The margin profile at these lower sales level, how does that compare versus your expectations? Previously, and then I just want to make sure I caught you right, that it was a 10% decline in the revenue expectations because just three quarters of the full-year revenue run rate, that does seem to be a touch higher than the revenue guidance for Transporeon that we're seeing here?
David Barnes: Yes. So first, the 10% refers to will have – we project 10% less revenue than you could have extrapolated from the directional indication we gave in December. It's still growing. It's just growing a little more slowly than we'd expect. From a margin perspective, we indicated that EBITDA margins would be about 30%. I still think that's the long-term trend, but we've lost a little bit of fixed cost leverage. Probably the simplest way to think about that for the year, Jerry, is Transporeon margins will be pretty close to the Trimble average this year and then higher as the business gets back to growth or higher levels of growth.
Jerry Revich: Got it. Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. So ,the gross margin breakout was quite interesting, and I understand that the mix is favorable as hardware decline and software continues growing. I guess my question is, is there anything we should think about is that having taken a step function up and you reinvest it in R&D? Or is it really more of a shifting mix of business?
David Barnes: Yes. There's two big factors that drove gross margin up significantly in the quarter. One is, as you said, the mix shift is very favorable because our hardware business was down and the software business was up, but an equally important factor is that we're way past the hump of our inflationary cycle in our hardware businesses. In fact, year-on-year, our input costs are down. We were heavily dependent on expedited freight in the broker market for parts a year ago, and we've got more price realization. So, we have seen a pretty important improvement in the margins within our hardware portfolio.
Rob Wertheimer: And then, should we think about that as being sustainable in a way and then being consciously reinvested in more R&D?
David Barnes: Well, we're investing in our business. The guidance and the script comments reflect. We don't think the gross margins will stay at the high level they were in Q1 for the rest of the year. We'll be modestly below that, partly because the mix comes back to a more normalized mix as our hardware businesses get past the hump of dealer inventory reductions. But look, if you look at our operating expense, even for – with the year's outlook, we will grow OpEx faster than revenue.  We normally don't like to do that, but we're investing against our business. Part of it is R&D. Part of it is against the digital transformation, the creation of platforms. So, we are investing against the business even while we get through the noise of the supply chain and the higher gross margins helps us do that.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you very much. And then just one last one. On channel destock, has anything happened in the last 2 or 3 months to increase the headwind from destock? I'm thinking about the ag channel and moves OEMs are doing there? And maybe if you could broadly just tell us when we're through the [destock pulse] [ph]? So, I will stop there. Thank you.
David Barnes: Sure. I'd say the pace of inventory, destock is exactly what we thought it would be a quarter ago, and we'll be essentially all the way through it by mid-year. We're on the plan on destocking that we laid out a quarter ago. And yes, I think that answers your question. And that's true for our businesses in aggregate, so including the ag business.
Rob Wertheimer: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen: Great. Thank you. Good morning. David, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the reinvestment, specifically about the digital transformation. Rob, you closed the prepared remarks talking about the data flywheel. So, can you just talk to us about where we are in that journey? How you intend to make better utilization of that data? And just yes, at what stage we are in, sort of that reinvestment journey for the back-end systems to support?
David Barnes: I'll comment on pacing and Rob can add on the data strategy. So, we're about to cross an important milestone where we've put into production, the digital backbone for our North American enterprise software business for the construction industry, so that will go live next week. And what that does, Kristen, is systematically enables the TC1 bundles that we've been selling in a sort of [indiscernible] way to date.  And we've had success in the [indiscernible] approach, but we're about to cross an important milestone in what we call digitally-enabled Trimble construction one with bundles that are more accessible and easier for our people to sell and our customers to consume. This is part of the journey we're on. We have additional rollout scheduled for our digital transformation that over the next couple of years will benefit the whole of our business. So, we're going to see some tangible – much more tangible benefits from the investments we've been making on digital transformation.
Rob Painter: Kristen, I'll add a comment on the data strategy, part of your question. And I start with the corpus of data at Trimble and construction, we manage over $1 trillion of construction projects and ag, we manage over technology and over 180 million acres of farmland and transportation. We manage a couple of million vehicles on the road, and that's even pre-Transporeon, and our geospatial business fundamentally is about creating a digital model of the physical earth. So there's, I'd say, a profound corpus of data opportunities. Our digital transformation, a big part of that is unlocking that data, getting it into the cloud. Once you've got it in a cloud, I have the opportunity to take data into information. And then when we're thinking about artificial intelligence, we've been playing in this arena for a while, it's quite exciting. It's actually also quite fun. We're already developing predictive and generative AI-based solutions covering all of our end markets and covering a number of workflows within that. And I will still say, we are very, very early in the journey. So, if you take a market like agriculture, with the Bilberry acquisition that we did on selective spring, we're applying deep learning technology to be able to identify [weeds] [ph] and enable spraying at the plant level instead of at the field level in our Viewpoint business and construction, we're applying natural language processing to automate invoicing processing workflows. In the Geospatial business, we're working on already point cloud semantic segmentation so then you can automatically extract and classify assets from large data sets and in our transportation business. We have video intelligence solutions that can detect fatigue and driver distraction and therefore, improve the safety, and we're just at the beginning of this.
Kristen Owen: That's very helpful. And leads me to my follow-up question, which is really one about the competitive environment. I mean you talked about some of the trends that we've seen on the technology side. And certainly, over your tenure, you've seen a lot of shifts in that technology space. But I think the investor sentiment suggests that some of the recent announcements that you all have made and maybe some of those made by your partners, suggest that there's a shift happening in the competitive environment. So, can you just speak to that? Any discussion of disintermediation or how you view your competitive positioning today? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Rob Painter: From a competitive standpoint, the thing that is most singularly unique about Trimble, and I think forms the basis of our right to win in our markets is our ability to connect the physical and the digital world. So, it's connecting work in the office with work in the field. That means connecting the hardware and the software of Trimble. And I think in that respect, we're singularly unique. When I think about potential OEM disintermediation, I go to the customer, that customer is a farmer, it's a contractor, it's a trucking company. More often than not, they're looking for a neutral provider of technology to operate across a mixed fleet. And we don't see that fundamentally changing in the aftermarket, and we hear more customers saying, how is this going to work for me if I have OEM proprietary technology, multiple OEM proprietary technology? Because remember, they operate mixed fleets. How does that benefit a customer? That's what we hear feedback from out in the field, and it gives me conviction that we're on the right path. Now, does that mean that, that will – that OEMs would not, let's say, pursue a strategy, I'd say, of course, not. We just have to be able to innovate faster and show that value of the connection between the physical and the digital world. That's why for the last 15 years, 20 years, we've been creating a software ecosystem around that hardware that we have to create these integrated and connected workflows. Not to mention that's the technology side of it. And then you apply the go-to-market aspect of you actually take this to market, how you actually monetize what are the business models around it, where are the data insights that you can unlock from this. So, I'd say, yes, there is certainly a different competitive environment that exists today versus 5, 10, 15 years ago. And I think a lot of the let's say, competitive world woke up to the attractiveness of these markets that we're serving that are large, global, underserved and underpenetrated. So, we feel good about where we stand in that environment, Kristen.
Kristen Owen : Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. With the Transporeon acquisition, can you give us a little bit more color on the impact to the growth rate? And maybe what incrementally changed in the macro to cause that reduction in expectation? It's a little bit of a larger reduction than we would have thought just given the price paid for the company?
Rob Painter: So Jonathan, this is Rob. Good morning. From, I'd say, if I look at the financials of the business, whether that's the overall growth of the business, the gross margins, the ARR growth in the business, the bookings growth in the business, we see those as accretive to the to the business model of overall Trimble that doesn't change. And then our view is – continues to be look at the mid-term and beyond, and it will be even more significantly accretive given the nature of the platform and the density that the business has of carriers and shippers. To the second question on what changed in the macro view. And I'd say, yes, absolutely, it's disappointing from my perspective as well. When we break down the underlying factors, we looked and saw a couple of things, and maybe three things to mention. The first is the overall level of transactions has gone down in Europe. And when we look at the end markets, markets like CPG, retail, chemicals or three relatively big markets for the business. The transaction volume slowed more than we expected. CPG, I look at that one is one that people are still going to eat. So, I don't lose a conviction that this is a temporary phenomenon in the business. The second aspect, which really probably also relates to the third is the spot prices have come down and the business differentially monetizes when spot rates are higher. So, spot rates will come down if transaction volume comes down. The third piece, which connects actually though, back to spot prices, is that truck capacity went up in Europe and so if you follow new unit trucks hitting the market in Europe, that capacity increased at the same time as the transaction slowed further pressuring spot prices. So, those would be the three factors. But now let me not end on that note, let me end on the note that we expect to see 30% bookings growth in the business this year. When we look at prior economic cycles in the business, this business has accelerated out of each of those cycles. It's fundamentally a transaction-oriented business. There's no loss of customers. In fact, when rates are strong as ever, 40 new customers were onboarded onto the platform in the first quarter before we owned it. So, the underlying fundamentals of the quality, I would say, of the business are there. And we believe it would be poised to as a bounce back when the markets improve.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And just in terms of a quick follow-up. Can you give us a sense of what your dollar-based net retention looks like for your ARR? We're just trying to understand sort of how much of that ARR is coming from new versus existing customers? Thank you.
David Barnes: Jonathan, you're talking about for the company as a whole?
Jonathan Ho: Company as a whole?
David Barnes: Yes. I'll focus on the outlook for the year. We expect net retention to be very strong, north of 100% in the ZIP code of 110%. What gets us there? Our churn varies by business and most of our recurring businesses the churn is very low in the low to mid-single digits. SketchUp is structurally higher than that, but we generate the positive net retention pushing at high-single-digits through low churn and upsell and cross-sell of new offerings. And as Rob mentioned, the uniqueness of the breadth of our offering, we're really having traction in the building software portfolio of cross-selling, Viewpoint and our ]Technostructures] [ph] and MEP offerings. And so, that's what gets net retention into the high single-digit range. 100-plus high single digits.
Rob Painter: And Jonathan, the thing I'd add to that is the nature of the technology at Trimble is that it's mission-critical. You're using it most of the day. It's not a nice to have on the shelf-type software that you can easily get rid of.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Chad Dillard: Hi, good morning guys.
David Barnes: Hi, Chad.
Chad Dillard: So, I want to go back to an earlier question about ARR in the Building and Infrastructure business. I think you talked about, Rob going from, kind of 13% to about greater than 20%. I was just curious about what line of sight do you have to that? Maybe you can talk about any key products that are driving that? And to what extent are you seeing some of the cross-sell driving some of that growth?
Rob Painter: Sure, Chad. Hey, this is Rob. So the 13% was at the company level of organic ARR growth that we see going up through the rest of the year. If we go into Buildings and Infrastructure, specifically, the Buildings and Infrastructure grows, ARR has been growing faster than that company average. And we expect that to grow throughout the year as well in Buildings and Infrastructure. When we go through the business reviews, and one of the things that is, I'd say, great about an ARR business model is, we closed in the quarter at $1.65 billion of ARR. And by the way, that's a conservative view of ARR. We don't take the contracted ARR view at the end of the quarter, which would be higher. But we wake up on the first day of the second quarter, and we've got line of sight to $1.65 billion of revenue going forward for the next year. And you can see that show up in the remaining performance obligations. And so, when we look at the businesses, you can get a bit scientific about it because you can go and do a go get analysis. You understand the revenue you're walking in with whether it's a quarter or a year or multi-year period. You know get delta that you have to close in order to hit the ARR forecast. Against that delta, you look at a pipeline that you have a bookings pipeline and then it's a conversion ratio of that bookings pipeline to what can hit short-term ARR versus will become deferred revenue that's monetized over time. Now, within that, if I take Buildings and Infrastructure, specifically, cross-sell and upsell are significantly driving business for us, the bookings of business that we have. What we're seeing is that we're bringing on new logos as we go to market as One Trimble through this Trimble Construction One offering. We're seeing cross-sell between Viewpoint and Tekla. We're seeing it from our bid-to-win acquisition and the Viewpoint business. We're seeing it from Viewpoint and our MEP business. I'm just really proud of the team who's put in the work to define the business model offerings and to organize the go-to-market efforts and the sales enablement behind that to actually execute on a vision. It's easy to have a division. The work happens behind the scenes to bring it to life. And the team is – continues to deliver proof points that we're on the right track here. We're seeing higher win rates in the deals in the market. We're seeing larger deal sizes when we go to market as One Trimble, we're seeing shorter sales cycles when we do it. So, I like the setup. We expect to continue to see strong growth. Buildings and Infrastructure and the construction software within that, that's the tip of the spear for the transformation at Trimble. We're putting really I'd say the strong, strong majority of our efforts behind making that business successful and using that as a template for the rest of the organization. And I think the last thing I would say is, ultimately, we're taking dollars to the bank, not percentages. These numbers continue to get bigger and bigger. So, posting strong double-digit growth on a larger base, I think is worth noting, David, I think, mentioned in his comments that we could expect to see $2 billion of ARR by the end of the year and Buildings and Infrastructure would presumably be about half of that.
Chad Dillard: That's helpful. My second question is about just your two core channels, right? So, you've got the OEM channel aftermarket. First, can you just break down the mix between the two? And then secondly, more specific to OEM. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? What was the growth in 1Q? And then what are you expecting through the balance of the year?
Rob Painter: Sorry, Chad, do you mean at a company level? Or do you mean at a segment level?
Chad Dillard: I mean company level to begin with, but if you can give that segment detail, I'll be most curious about B&I and resource.
Rob Painter: Well, from a segment perspective, we – outside of Resources and Utilities actually very little goes through OEMs. It's in the single-digit percentage in the Resource and Utilities. Of course, that's agriculture. And I think we've said about 25%.
David Barnes: It was a little higher than that in 2022 because actually, our business through OEMs was particularly strong. So, it was about a third of our R&U segment. And it's held up well, I'll say. So, our business with OEMs is strong right now.
Chad Dillard: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Jason Celino: Hi gentlemen. Good morning. Your construction software business continues to be one of your better performing segments, a lot of questions today so far. But David, you mentioned seeing a little bit of additional churn in Q1 for some term licenses. It sounds like it's minor, but I don't know if you can clarify this a little bit.
David Barnes: Yes. I don't think it's additional versus any longer-term trend. It's just that the term licenses, it's actually a bit of a factor of our old technology that we're improving with our new digital infrastructure, but the terms all coincide on January 1. So, if you're going to churn as a customer, you churn on January 1. So, it's – I call that a blip. That factor won't recur in any of the coming quarters. And we think we're on the sustained trend of solid ARR growth for Buildings and Infrastructure. As Rob said, it was about 20%, and we think it will end the year a little more than where we were in Q1.
Jason Celino: Okay. So, it sounds like this might be for some of your older solutions.
David Barnes: I wouldn't say it's older solutions. It's solutions that are enabled by our older infrastructure technology as we roll-out our digital infrastructure, we could be more flexible in how our licensing models work, and we won't have the situation where our terms all in at the same time, which isn't convenient for us or even for some of our customers. So, that's how things will improve.
Jason Celino: Okay, perfect. And then on second quarter specifically, I think, any way to clarifying how much Transporeon is contributing? I realized that the full year is 135 million, but anything that we should know about seasonality or how that might ramp through the year? Thanks.
David Barnes: Yes. So it's $135 million for the three quarters, a little less than a third of that. Around 30% will be in Q2 and corresponding you'll have a little more than a third in Q4.
Jason Celino: Perfect. Thank you.
David Barnes: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Tami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, my first question is on the transportation segment. So, we've heard some Chuck OEMs partnering with third parties to install a single device that runs on an open platform and is developing apps for ELV tools, telematics and stuff. So, what are the risks or opportunities for Trimble in this emerging new narrative?
Rob Painter: Hi, good morning, Tami. It's Rob. Well, we've been working in this space as you know for a long time, both predominantly in the aftermarket, but with one OEM in our transportation business, in the short-term, we don't see a change to the business that we have with our OEM partner. Long-term or actually even mid-to-long term, the exact nature of the upgrades we're making on our technology in the transportation business is to deliver the open platform that customers in the aftermarket have been looking for. Back to an earlier conversation we're having in the Q&A on mix fleets. The same dynamic happens with trucking companies most are operating multiple – yes, multiple truck OEMs within their fleet even different engine types. So, you can have really quite different configurations, different configuration perform better at different parts of the country. What you would need here in Colorado and the mountains is a different machine or I'd say a different truck performed – is optimized better here than it is in a different part of the country. And so, we continue to see customers looking to integrate mixed fleets. When you have that open platform that can come out of the OEMs, when they have that openness, you can put in a Trimble or a Trimble competitor technology and user interface on top of that. So, I think it's an equalizer in the market.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. Another quick one from me. Is there any seasonality we should expect from the 135 million incremental revenue from Transporeon or should we just ratably allocate over the next three quarters?
David Barnes: Yes. Tami, it's David. There is some seasonality in the business. Historically, it's strongest in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of goods that flow closer to the holiday season. But I don't – there's also some underlying growth. So, the way I would suggest you look at it the way we look at it is of the 135 million, we'll have roughly 30% in Q2, a third in Q3 and a little more than a third of Q4.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Josh Tilton: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just want to step back for a second. Can you maybe just help us understand why in-light of the [current macro] [ph], you're only reducing Transporeon revenue expectations, but you're reiterating the guidance for the rest of the business? Can you maybe just talk to the visibility that you have for the rest of the year? And what gives you confidence in hitting the back half numbers?
David Barnes: Hey, Josh, David Barnes. I'll start. So the Transporeon business model, as Rob mentioned, is transaction-based, principally not a subscription. So, our software offerings, as Rob discussed earlier, are mission-critical for our customers and are much less susceptible to any short-term trend in the end customers ongoing transaction or ongoing level of business. Our view is that there's some puts and takes, but the aggregate demand we see for our business has not changed over the last 90 days. We do see some signs that in a few of our end markets, actually, the overall macro outlook is improving. I look at Geospatial, for instance, we assess our dealers for their sentiment. We talked to some of their customers in the survey business. They're feeling a little better than they were. Input costs are abating. So, overall, we're very confident with the outlook for the rest of the business that we articulated a quarter ago. Transporeon is impacted by the particular macros of Europe and the end markets they serve.
Rob Painter: I can add a little color to that. I encourage you to separate the software businesses from the hardware businesses and that analysis. If you look at the software business. I submit there's 1.65 billion reasons to have conviction in our view of the rest of the year, and that's because that's the ARR. And again, that's not even a contracted ARR, which would be higher than that, 1.6 billion of backlog or those remaining performance obligations as well gives us visibility. We know the bookings we have. It's really a bit of a science to translate to bookings into the recognized revenue. So, our conviction and our predictability on that stream of our revenue is going to be the highest. And then I think you take separately the hardware businesses, which David walked you through. We've been through dynamics of the dealer inventory stabilization. Now, let's look at the macros around it. And I think that's a fair question to test our conviction on this. [Take agriculture,] [ph] we see farm income being healthy this year. We take North America construction, and we see the infrastructure bill being providing a tailwind the business. So, those are the kind of factors that go into our view for the rest of the year. And certainly then would become the things that we have to watch and then we'll update you on again next quarter.
Josh Tilton: Super helpful. And then maybe one more for me. I know you guys got a lot of questions on Building and Infrastructure. I'm going to ask one more, although it's maybe a little unusual. A lot of your construction peers believe that it's kind of hard to know exactly which markets are stronger and which are weaker, given their customers' portfolios are very diversified. So, first of all, I guess, we really appreciate the disclosure on the residential infrastructure strength. But I guess my question is like, is there something unique to your business that gives you the visibility into which markets are performing better or worse than maybe your peers don't have?
Rob Painter: I think there is a – what we've built – our strategy is fundamentally to connect users' data and workflow across industry continuums. In construction, we work with architects, engineers, contractors, and owners across the life cycle from design to build to operate. So, we have a business that focuses on architects and designers, let's say, in engineering and construction. We work with mechanical, electrical, plumbing, steel, concrete, contractors. So, we have visibility into the trades inside of MEP. We can look at the digital supply chain to connect an estimate and a design model actually out to the components that you ultimately buy and transact as you create those estimates. In the construction side, we both – we obviously work in civil construction as well as building construction and our Viewpoint software. It's the system of record. It's the ERP. So, we know what kind of businesses our customers are in, and we can get a meta view of the employees they have of the backlog that they have of the work that we're doing. And then on the owner side, even though I'm describing that as the last one in the chain, the owners actually are at the beginning of the chain, and we have a set of businesses that are managing capital programs and asset management and permitting. So, I think Trimble has a more unique view as compared to any other peer that we have in the industry given how we serve specific personas across the industry life cycle. And so, we can see activity at a level of specificity that I think would be quite unique.
Josh Tilton: Much appreciated. Thank you guys so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason of Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Rob, you talked about the work that you'll be doing this year to transition some of your ag channel to more independent dealers. How can we track your progress or what markers should we be watching, I guess, leading up to that transition of the channel? And would you expect that the net effect of that transition this year to be neutral or positive or negative on 2023?
Rob Painter: Well, we would see the transition this year. I guess I would characterize as neutral to perhaps a little positive. I can tell you qualitatively, the feedback we're getting in the market is quite positive. We are having success, good early success of signing up dealers who want to work with Trimble both existing dealers and new dealers who see good business opportunities here. If you think about what's unique about what we can do in from an aftermarket perspective as we have kits available for 10,000 different machines. That's pretty darn unique to be able to do that. When I spend time out in the field with dealers and with the farmers, they are looking for support. Like – and I mean support from people who know technology and how it works, not support from iron but support from technology. And so, we get very – we're getting very good feedback that we need to work with you. We want to work with you because you know how to – you know technology, you know how to support it. You're on the machine types. And by the way, Trimble, you have the full portfolio, a broader technology portfolio. We don't just do steering and guidance, we do implement controls. We do water management. We have software. We have selective spring. And so, those have been the positives that are so far, I'd say, creating good progress for us as we transition the channel. To your question about proof points as an investor and analyst, you can track the progress of that. Let us take that as an action item of how we can provide more quantitative color around that. Obviously, you'll see the face of the financials and revenue and margin progression against what we're – against what we're saying, but let us take that as a topic for what additional disclosure would make sense going forward.
Rob Mason: That's helpful. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up around Transporeon. Obviously, it's European-centric. How should we think about your ability and maybe pace of the ability to leverage that platform and penetrate other geographies in North America, in particular, I guess? And how would your approach necessarily need to differ if it would to build a network outside of Europe versus what they have done in Europe?
Rob Painter: Sure. So, actually I'll start in Europe. So, we had prior to the acquisition, we had a relatively small carrier business. So, mobility business for carriers. We will combine that business with Transporeon. That will make sense. One, because Transporeon obviously works with shippers and carriers, we think we can get a stronger European carrier business if those businesses are working together. Within Europe, we have underlying technology that we can replace third parties with Trimble technology and bring a modest amount of cost synergy to the business within Europe. And within Europe, it's been really interesting to see some of the phone calls that we've got, some of which may have been positive surprises from forestry companies saying, Hey, actually, I need help because they're already working with us in forestry.  We need help with the transportation and logistics, how can we connect this with forestry. We've heard the same thing with building construction where you're looking for visibility to understand when that construction supply chain components are going to show up to a job site. So, we're encouraged that some early inquiry that we've received within Europe. Now, let's go outside of Europe and North America would be the obvious place to go given the centricity of revenue that we already have in North America. And so, the teams are actively working together to bring I'd say, a couple of aspects of Transporeon technology around automated procurement or autonomous procurement into the U.S. market or North American market this year, some of those quick win-type opportunities. I was in Brazil in January. And what we discovered there is, we have – our Trimble already has a telematics business or mobility business in Brazil, Transporeon has a small operation in Brazil doing freight audit, that becomes something that we can connect together given the geography we're already in. So, where we're already in, geographies that's an easier play to bring capabilities together. I'd say the new, new geography, those tend to be slower and harder and would not, in this environment, be my first priority, where to allocate capital.
Rob Mason: That’s helpful. Appreciate the response. Thank you.
Operator: As there are no further questions, I would like to thank our speakers for today's presentation, and thank you all for joining us. This now concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-08 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. The Trimble 3-4-3 operating model simultaneously balances a view on looking forward 3 months, 4 quarters and 3 years. As I think about framing today’s commentary on 2022, I think there is a parallel to look back 3 months at our fourth quarter, 4 quarters to look back at the year 2022, and 3 years back to 2020 when we began our Connect and Scale journey. COVID, supply chain disruptions and net divestitures over these last 3 years has created a dynamic that makes it challenging to discern the signal from the noise in any given quarter, especially when looking at the year-over-year trends; whereas the long baseline reveals the definitive patterns of progression. As I reflect on the fourth quarter of 2022, let’s begin on Slide 2 with our key messages, which are consistent with the commentary from the prior quarter. Our key growth metric is annualized recurring revenue, which met our expectations and grew 16% to a record level of $1.60 billion. Congratulations to the team for delivering this record performance, which compares to $1.19 billion of ARR at the end of 2019. Total revenue for the year was a record $3.68 billion, up 7% over 2021, and up 6% compounded since 2019, growing through COVID and business model transitions. Total revenue in the quarter was $857 million, flat with last year, and towards the lower end of our guidance range. The delta between the ARR and total revenue performance reflects a slowdown in hardware sales through our dealer partners, as dealers continued to sell-through their inventory while processing mixed macroeconomic sentiment. For perspective, over the last 3 years, the sum of our civil, agriculture and survey hardware and related software has grown at a 12% compound annual growth rate, with agriculture growing above and survey growing below this baseline. Gross margin finished at a record level of 61.8%, exceeding our expectations, reflecting software mix, the cumulative impact of model conversions and abating supply chain disruptions. For the year, we achieved a 60% gross margin, a record annual level, up 170 basis points year-over-year, which compares to 57.7% gross margin in 2019. EBITDA margin of 24.3% met our expectations in the quarter and ended at 25% for the year, up 210 basis points as compared to 22.9% in 2019. Finally, earnings per share of $0.60 was exactly at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. Moving to Slide 3, let’s look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments, beginning with Buildings and Infrastructure. The big event for the team was our Trimble Dimensions user conference in November, where we had over 5,700 attendees from the global engineering and construction industry, which provided a great forum to reconnect with our customers and partners. We launched many new innovations, including the Trimble Construction Cloud, powered by Microsoft Azure, which is an industry cloud built to streamline construction projects by connecting users, data and workflow. We also announced extensions of our machine control technology platform to new OEMs and new machine types, further expanding our reach to connect the physical and digital worlds. The highlight financial achievement in the quarter was delivering over 20% organic growth in ARR, in addition to record levels of ACV software bookings and record levels of cross-sell bookings. We also had a strong start for our newly acquired Bid2Win business, where we’ve had some early cross-sell wins. As we have previously discussed, we continue to allocate incremental capital towards our own digital transformation, as well as our go-to-market efforts, which are generating strong interest from our customers and partners and demonstrating encouraging signs of internal productivity and efficiency. The work we are doing in this business will be highly leveraged across the entirety of the company. In Geospatial, revenue was down further than expected, as dealers moderated their inventory levels in the face of softening demand and macro uncertainty. Looking at the indicators, we see softness in residential, and while a portion of the expansion of infrastructure is getting consumed by inflation, underlying optimism remains in the market. For perspective, I look at the 3-year CAGR that I talked about on Slide 2 in order to calibrate the long baseline performance. Strategically speaking, in 2022, we continued to launch new innovations in GNSS, 3D laser scanning and handheld data collectors, and we achieved a double-digit increase in ARR as our business model strategy takes hold. In Transportation, we delivered revenue and ARR growth in line with expectations, in addition to delivering the fourth quarter in a row of operating margin expansion. Connect and Scale progression also came in the form of continued development of connected workflows, such as Connected Maintenance, Connected Locations and Engage Lane. The big story, of course, in the fourth quarter was the announcement of the Transporeon acquisition. To refresh memories, Transporeon operates a leading cloud-based transportation management platform, powering a global network of 145,000 carriers and 1,400 shippers. The platform integrates with more than 3,000 systems and powered more than 25 million transactions in 2022. For me, this is the very definition of a Connect and Scale business. I had a chance to spend a few days in Europe with Stephan Sieber and the Transporeon team in January, and my level of conviction of strategic and cultural fit has only increased. We are still working through regulatory approvals and we expect to close the deal in the first half of this year. We are excited to get to work together. In Resources and Utilities, revenue and ARR growth were led by our positioning services, utilities and forestry businesses. Our definition of utilities covers our work with electrical and water utilities, but our positioning services business can also be thought of as a utility, in this case, precision GPS as a utility. In October, we announced that we crossed a hurdle of 34 million hands-free miles driven with General Motors and their Super Cruise program. Our precise GPS technology enables a vehicle to maintain its lane position in various environments, and we are working on several other Tier 1 and OEM program opportunities. Moving to agriculture, revenue was flat year-over-year, and up when excluding Russia and Ukraine. The 3-year, double-digit CAGR growth on Slide 2 is instructive for calibrating the long baseline growth of the agriculture business. With a product lens on Connect and Scale, we are now bundling our guidance hardware, software and our positioning services, providing both easier access to the technology and a better value proposition for our customers. With a go-to-market lens on Connect and Scale, users and customers are at the center of our strategy. In pursuit of this strategy, we announced this week that we are taking a different approach to our go-to-market relationship with CNH Industrial. Moving forward, our distribution to aftermarket customers, after a 12-month transition period, will be done entirely through independent dealer partners, with the product bearing the Trimble brand. Less than 20% of our revenue in the Resources and Utilities segment goes through CNH to their dealer network today. We expect to maintain this revenue and address aftermarket demand and the needs of farmers through our direct relationships with our independent dealer network. This evolved approach to distribution will also enhance our ability to offer OEM brand agnostic solutions to customers to help them orchestrate their field operations with mixed fleets of equipment. Our new approach to aftermarket distribution will improve our ability to sell our full range of technology solutions to aftermarket customers, including guidance, selective spraying, variable rate application, water management and our Connected Farm works center software solution. Our evolving strategy will also enhance our ability to cooperate with OEMs across the industry for their needs for factory-fit equipment. Let me now turn the call over to David to take us through the numbers.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Starting on Slide 4, I'd like to begin my financial commentary this quarter by discussing organic growth trends across the components of our business. As Rob mentioned earlier, our recurring revenue businesses grew strongly year-on-year in the fourth quarter, with ARR up 16%. The strength of our recurring revenue offerings in a weakening and uncertain macroeconomic environment validates our focus on the continued evolution of our business model. While our recurring revenue streams were strong in the fourth quarter, revenues of hardware and related software were down. Organic hardware revenue was down 13% versus prior year and came in below our expectations. The factors driving the slowdown in our hardware business in the fourth quarter were consistent with what we described in our third quarter call. During the fourth quarter, our dealers continued to reduce their inventory levels, reflecting both our improving supply chain execution and uncertainty in the future economic outlook. The drop in demand was most pronounced in our Geospatial segment, as our surveying end customers ordered less than they did earlier in 2022. Hardware backlog reduced sequentially during the quarter as expected. From a geographic perspective, revenues were up modestly on an organic basis in both North America and the Rest of World, with strong trends in Latin America, but were down in Europe and in Asia Pacific. Year-on-year, Europe trends were meaningfully impacted by the loss of business in Russia and Ukraine and were up 1% organically excluding that impact. With that as a backdrop, I’d like to turn now to our total financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Starting on Slide 5, fourth quarter revenues of $857 million were flat on an organic basis, and down 8% when including the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions and divestitures. Gross margin was up 400 basis points, reflecting both the accelerating mix shift toward software and the positive net impact of our price increases and moderating cost inflation. EBITDA margin was up 20 basis points and operating margin was down 20 basis points, as increases in our gross margin largely offset higher spending against our Connect and Scale strategy, especially our digital transformation and higher spending on travel and trade shows. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60. Looking at cash flow, both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were, as expected, down year-on-year, with the single biggest factor being the amortization of R&D for tax purposes. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, and do not plan to restart our repurchases until we are well on the way to de-levering following the issuance of debt to fund the Transporeon acquisition. Turning to Slide 6 and results for the full year 2022, we achieved success across a number of critical dimensions. Organic revenue grew by 7%. Gross margin improved by 170 basis points, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing mix shift. EBITDA margin was 25%, even as we restored spending across a number of areas that had been constrained during the COVID pandemic and as we accelerated investments against our strategy. Cash flow was down year-on-year principally as a result of an increase in our inventories and a change in U.S tax legislation, both of which we expect to normalize over time. As we move to complete the Transporeon acquisition, we take this on with a strong balance sheet. Working capital remains negative. Our year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 1.4x and the ratings agencies maintained our bond ratings and stable outlooks following the announcement of the transaction. Turning now to our quarterly and annual results by segment on Page 7. Speaking to the fourth quarter, Buildings and Infrastructure achieved organic ARR growth of over 20% and recurring bookings growth in the high teens. Sales of civil construction hardware were down year-on-year by just over 10%, leading to organic revenue growth for the segment of 2%. Dealers continued to reduce their inventory levels, and end market demand moderated. Segment margins at 25% were down year-on-year, impacted by lower civil construction revenue, our Dimensions user conference, subscription transition and Connect and Scale investments. Revenues in the hardware centric Geospatial segment were down 12% year-on-year on an organic basis, driven principally by declining dealer inventory levels and softer end market demand across the surveying sector. Segment revenues were also pressured by lower shipments to U.S Federal customers, which vary meaningfully from quarter-to-quarter and can be difficult to predict. Segment margins remained over 25% despite these headwinds. Revenues in our Resources and Utilities segment were up 6% organically driven by growth from Cityworks and positioning services sold to agriculture customers. Our agriculture revenue was impacted by the loss of business in Russia and Ukraine, with an estimated year-on-year impact of minus 5% to the segment in the fourth quarter. Segment margins improved in the quarter sequentially and versus prior year, coming in just under 36%. Our fourth quarter results in the Transportation segment reflect improvement across a number of dimensions. Organic revenue grew 5%, driven by higher year-on-year sales of Enterprise and Maps software solutions. ARR for the segment grew at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter. Revenue trends in our mobility offerings improved sequentially from prior quarters, driven in part by higher sales to our largest OEM customer. Operating margins of 14.5% were the highest since 2019, and reflect strong performance by our team in managing costs. Let’s turn next to our guidance for 2023 on Slide 8. The projections I will share with you today exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of Transporeon. Starting with ARR, we expect organic ARR growth at a mid-teens level in 2023. Our strong outlook for ARR growth is grounded in the solid bookings momentum we achieved in 2022, the potential for accelerated cross-sell as our digital transformation rolls out to a growing portion of our business, and the essential role that our software plays in our customers’ operations. Our outlook for revenue, excluding future acquisitions and divestitures, is $3.7 million to $3.8 billion, reflecting an expectation of organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%. As a reminder, divestitures of businesses in 2022 will impact total reported revenue growth trends, with the biggest impact in the first half of the year. Our cautious outlook for 2023 organic revenue growth is rooted in an expectation of continued dealer inventory reductions over the next several quarters, and softer end market demand in an environment of limited GDP growth. We expect revenue from hardware and related software will be down in the low single digits organically for the year, offset by strong recurring revenue growth. From a margin perspective, we expect that gross margins will improve by over 200 basis points as our business mix continues to shift in the direction of higher margin software. We expect a modest increase in operating margins, as we invest against our strategy in an environment where organic revenue growth is harder to come by. I'll note here that our leadership teams have been working hard over the last several months to adapt our spending plans to the current economic climate. Allocating capital against our strategic priorities is always a major focus for us, and the need for sharp focus is never higher than in a time of weak economic growth. We are confident that we can continue to progress our strategy within the constraints of our operating plan. Income from equity investments is expected to be relatively flat with 2022, and net interest expense is forecast at approximately $70 million. Netting this out, we project to achieve earnings per share in the range of $2.66 to $2.86. We expect that cash flow will grow significantly in 2023 driven in part by reductions in inventory levels. We expect free cash flow for the year of approximately 1x non-GAAP net income. Our cash flow forecast for this year now assumes that amortization of R&D costs under Section 174 of the U.S tax code will not be repealed within a time frame that will allow us to recover the accelerated tax payments that we made in 2022. While we believe that there is bipartisan support for this change, we are less confident than we were a quarter ago that this legislation will pass soon enough to help us this year. By way of reminder, this issue impacts the timing of tax payments and has an immaterial impact on our tax rate. If Section 174 is repealed within the next several months, our free cash flow would benefit by approximately $150M. Note that our cash flow guidance excludes the impact of transactional costs related to the pending Transporeon acquisition. While we are not offering quarterly guidance, a few factors are likely to impact the sequential evolution of our financial results as the year progresses. We expect organic revenue to be down in the first quarter and flat in the first half of the year, reflecting the strong growth in hardware and related offerings that we saw in the first half of 2022. We expect organic revenue to be up in the mid- to high-single digits in the second half of the year. Influenced by these revenue growth patterns, we expect operating and EBITDA margins to be relatively flat in the first half of the year, and up in the second half. While we expect mid-teens organic ARR growth for the year, growth in the first half is likely to be slightly lower driven by planned churn from a small number of customers. We expect ARR growth to improve sequentially through the year. From a segment perspective, we expect organic revenue growth for the year in the Building and Infrastructure, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation segments, with the strongest growth in Buildings and Infrastructure. Revenues in the Geospatial segment are expected to decline for the year, with the highest levels of organic decline in the first quarter as we lap strong numbers from the first quarter of 2022. Geospatial trends through 2023 will continue to be impacted by reductions in dealer inventory levels and ongoing softness in demand in a number of the segment’s end markets. We expect margins to be stable in Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities. We project growth in Transportation margins, while Geospatial margins will be down modestly for the year. Back to you Rob.
Rob Painter: Let me thank our colleagues, customers and partners for their support and their work in our strategic and financial progression. I’m proud to say that we continue to win culture and innovation awards, and proud to announce that we received approval of our emissions reduction targets by the Science Based Targets Initiative. Our objective is a 50% reduction in scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2030. In addition, we released our first task force on climate related financial disclosures report. In 2022, our highlight financial metrics were ARR growth and gross margin expansion. Our 2022 ACV bookings give us confidence that we can continue to grow ARR at a double-digit rate in 2023. Hardware demand remains the hardest revenue stream to predict. While the signals are mixed, and even a bit confusing in the short-term, the long-term secular attractiveness remains. Our ability to uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds provides a guiding light for our business and remains the foundation of our right to win in our served markets. We have surgically reduced our expense structure and moderated spending across the Company to ensure discipline and focus in an uncertain environment. What remains certain is our conviction to grow our business by focusing on our customers and continuing to execute our Connect and Scale strategy. Operator, let’s now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Jonathan Ho at William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to maybe start out with the CNH aftermarket deal. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on why it makes sense to do this now and what this could potentially do for the resources and utility segment, particularly as you engage more with the independent dealers?
Rob Painter: Hey, good morning, Jonathan. It's Rob. So let me give you -- break it down in three respects, context, strategy and next steps. For context, let's talk about Connect and Scale, and our strategy means to connect users data and workflow and the users are at the center of our universe. And in that we believe we need to be closer to the customers that user, that farmer. So when we talk to the customers, and we work with, by the way over 100 OEMs today, and obviously, the farmers themselves, what they're asking us to do is to help them manage a mixed fleet. And I personally visited farmers in the last 6 months in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Japan, Australia, Germany, and here in the U.S. So the strategy is we -- go-to-market strategy is we sell-through multiple avenues today to reach our customers we sell. We have a direct sales, particularly the enterprise farms, we sell-through OEMs, we work with over 100 OEMs and then we sell-through a channel, and the channel breaks down into a Trimble channel that we already have today to reach the aftermarket as well as selling through CNH dealers in the aftermarket. So what we're moving from is where we sell to CNH today, so call it CNH --from Trimble to CNH corporate to reach the CNH dealer. That's the from the to -- the to be state we'll be going from Trimble straight to independent dealers. And those independent dealers will be capable of selling the full line of Trimble CAT, which is more than guidance, because we also do variable rate, we do selective spraying, we do water management, and we do software. So as we look forward to this, as we work through the transition, we need to sign up the dealers to be independent dealers directly with Trimble. And we think it can expand the available set of products and capabilities they have to take to market, we think that will help us be incrementally closer to the end users of the technology and in a context of customer success, which is part of our strategy. And we think we can help customers and those users become more successful with the technology because when we're out there in the field, talking to them, they are asking for help to integrate and manage a mixed fleet of technology as well as mixed fleet of equipment.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I think you've also referenced some additional investments that you'd like to make for that Connect and Scale in the 2023 timeframe. Can you help us understand where those investments are going to go? And again, maybe why that makes sense to make those investments now, given the macro environment? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Sure. So we've been investing in this strategy incrementally, really for the last couple of years. And demonstrable evidence of where we see the attractiveness of it and I'd say momentum for it is in the growth of the ARR. So the work we're doing up front really is touching more of our software businesses first, and particularly the recurring revenue businesses that we have. So a post of 16% organic growth on ARR, the 1.6 billion. This is supporting growth, continued growth and as and I think from a shareholder value perspective, this would be the most valuable revenue stream that we have at the company. The investments, they pick up systems, they pick up people, they pick up process, so from a systems perspective and customer facing, I think internal facing from a connect -- The scale part of Connect and Scale, enabling us to efficiently and effectively grow. Look at people and the work that we're doing, we look at customer success. Customer Success is about net retention. That's the metric you look at for customer success. And the economics of net retention are very, very powerful. So I'm of a mind, we're of a mind that we continue down this path. And if anything, we continue down this path with more, more conviction. And behind all of this there's a strong balance sheet 24.3% EBITDA in the quarter. So we believe this is emphatically the right thing to do at this moment.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: We'll go next to Rob Wertheimer at Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Hey, good morning, everybody. It seems like there's a lot of structural progress next quarter on margins on ARR, which is, I guess, continuing and the surprise, I guess, for us was just a bigger destock in the hardware than we would have thought. And so, I had a couple of questions around that. One is, were you able to see those elevated levels of inventory, previously dealers and for the normal after what you look in your outlook, or are they low? I mean, there's any characterization that I guess there's been a debate in construction in North America anyway, as to whether large projects will fill in, smaller projects go away. And that seems to be the case. But maybe your mix of your customers is more fragmented than the big ones. I'm just trying to look for context around why that decline happened and is continuing and how big it is.
David Barnes: Yes, hey, Rob. Its David Barnes. First point I'll make is that the supply chain, the constraints, and then the removed constraints has really moved trends around in our shipments, in our dealer inventory, that were hard to predict and in some cases, challenging to understand. So just by way of reminder, we had unsustainably and undesirably high hardware backlog early in 2022. Our supply chain even today isn't fully freed up, but to the extent that it freed up it happened very dramatically at the end of second quarter. So we shipped a lot of product, you'll recall that the hardware revenue was way up at that timeframe. So dealer inventories did grow. And I'll say it took us a while to figure out how quickly the dealers were able to find customers for and deploy that inventory. And that happened exactly while some of the end markets that our dealers serve slow, particularly in the geospatial side. There's probably the highest within Trimble level of exposure direct and indirect, to residential home construction, which slowed. There's some anxiety about the general economic outlook. So these two things happened all together, freeing up our supply chains, very big backlog, lots of shipments and I created the destocking that we talked about a quarter ago, and it has picked up. We're not through it yet. We think we have a pretty good sense of where our dealers want to be and where they will be over the sustained period of time. It's my guess that we'll have two more quarters, Q1 and Q2 of meaningful inventory reductions in our dealers and anything after that will be smaller. But the guidance we've given reflects that expectation.
Rob Wertheimer: And any guess on if those two quarters happen, or would dealers be lower than normal at that point, and they maybe don't have perfect visibility into the channel, I understand.
David Barnes: Yes, well, what I'll say is that we still do have isolated cases of supply challenges in our Ag, one of them. But I think at that point, they'll be -- so that there may be some reasons For dealers to have a little more inventory than they would have had pre-COVID, not much though. Supply is really good. Hey, Rob, the thing I remind you on as we look at this noise of one quarter to another, big increases in the first half of '22. And the decline, we just reported, Rob had a good chart in his presentation of the multiyear trend. We're still way above where we were. So we do think that a lot of this is the noise of the resetting of the supply chain. That's the bigger factor really than any fundamental change in demand.
Rob Wertheimer: That's perfect. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chad Dillard at Bernstein.
Chad Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys.
Rob Painter: Hey. Hi Chad. So I just want to go back to the CNH agreement. I just think in better understand the medium-term organic growth potential and maybe you can talk about what needs to be done to set up the independent channel. And when you expect that to be in place, and just how much of your product portfolio, you'll be able to sell within that channel versus how much you're able to sell with CNH.
Rob Painter: Hey, Chad, so this is Rob. I'll start with the quantitative framework. We had a chart on the second slide that showed over the last 3 years. The CAGR of the hardware businesses has been 12%. Those three businesses are surveys, civil construction, And Ag. Ag has been above that 12%. growth over the last 3 years. And Ag grew this year. And it grew even more if you exclude Russia and Ukraine, which was we were selling quite a bit of kit and to Russia. And so we'll start to lap that later this year, mid this year. So to call that context, in terms of the growth that we've had. And I'll give you some more context when we look at -- we look at units, we look at pricing, we look at share of wallet, we look at market share, and we think we're holding our own on a global basis and probably growing, growing in, Europe holding around and North America growing in Brazil. So we now turn to the to the CNH part of your question. For this only for that we're talking about the aftermarket business that we have with CNH. As we -- and that business that we sell-through CNH into the aftermarket today is primarily guidance. So an opportunity we have as we move to independent dealers. And remember we have independent dealers today, they're Trimble, four line Trimble dealers today in agriculture. As we move the business that goes through CNH, that gives us an opportunity to expand the product portfolio to a set of independent dealers. Those independent dealers could very well be dealers we already work with today, that just will happen in a direct route with a direct relationship with us at Trimble or it may be a fully New Dealer, we have a 12-month transition with CNH on this part of the arrangement. And it's a very positive conversation. I want to say that we've been having with the CNH with the CNH team. So optimistic here, it's the right thing to do with what our customers are asking for. And it's time to get to work to set it up. That's helpful. And then just my second question. So can you give an update on the digital transformation? What percentage are you done -- [indiscernible] '23. Can you talk about some of the focus areas for this coming year, and if you can quantify just like the incremental cost to execute expecting for '23.
David Barnes: So from -- I'll start with the second part, the incremental cost is about 100 bps to the bottom line consistent with what we've we had this year as well. So that's the cost side of the equation. On the focus side of the equation, the digital transformation, there's a meta theme, its more than a system transformation for us. So, I think about people, I think about process and think about systems and the systems themselves. And then we think about the go-to-market specs of the digital transformation. And it's primarily focused right now on supporting our software businesses, particularly software businesses within buildings, and infrastructure. And that connects with the Trimble construction one dialogue that we've had with you and others. And so, first point of reference I look at is continuing to grow the ACB bookings, which is the leading indicator for the growth of the ARR. When we look at net retention as a key metric as well with inside that go-to-market. We look at the organization of the sales team itself and the go-to-market. So in France, Benelux, we've put the construction sales team together, software team as 1 organization. We've mostly done that in North America as well. And so it's getting the sales team aligned to sell consolidated offering of Trimble Construction One. And then with Trimble Construction One, it started out as a general -- targeted to general contractors and then we will be releasing more persona-based bundles. Remember, we sell to owners in the public sector. We sell to architects and engineers. So we have targeted portfolios to sell to those personas with the go-to-market team, a sales team that comes more and more together, as 1 organization to be enabled and equipped to sell everything that we do. On the system side, in the second quarter, we'll have the next, I'll say, big release of the systems. Those systems are meant to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our own sellers. And it moves closer and closer to having commerce capabilities -- e-commerce capabilities from an external -- with an external lens. On the people side, we continue to invest in customer success. And on the process side, we continue to invest in developing the playbooks for how we go-to-market starting with that software business, but then the next wave after that goes into software and other parts of Trimble and then into the hardware that we sell-through our dealer channels. And I was asked -- we got asked a question earlier in the call about visibility into dealers and their inventory. This is another reason that we think that the systems investments are a good thing for us to get increased levels of precision on that visibility. Hope that helps, Chad.
Chad Dillard: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Kristen Owen at Oppenheimer.
Kristen Owen: Great. Thank you for the question. So I wanted to ask about the e-Builder, Viewpoint SketchUp contingency. This business is obviously doing quite well and a pretty stark contrast to some of the more conservative macro views that you've expressed. And even just on an ARR growth basis, really strong compared to some of the peers in the software space. We've talked about the macro, but I'm just wondering from a portfolio basis, if you can speak to the playbook with these businesses what's working in this environment? And just how do you intend to port those lessons learned over once the Transporeon acquisition closes?
Rob Painter: Sure. Good morning, Kristen. This is Rob. I will answer the question. So you're correct, that contingent of businesses is doing very well and it's even more than e-Builder, Viewpoint, SketchUp, it's from a Tekla Structures offering our mechanical electrical plumbing software as well or project management software, really the whole contingent is performing. I'll say 1 thing that is nice on the software side and the recurring revenue is certainly get a higher degree of predictability. There is not a wholesale in between the retail and so you get a clear demand -- a clear view of the demand, which is why, by the way, on the hardware side, we're looking back at the 3-year trend on the CAGR so that we can see the signal through the noise. In terms of what's working with it, I would say it's the value proposition meets the digitization of the market. So call it the secular aspect of digitization, had a chance to meet with a number of construction companies during my travels over the last month was with one of the largest European contractors in the world yesterday here in Colorado. And digitization and data and sustainability are at the top -- very top of the agenda of those customers, and they know they need to adopt technology in order to further their strategies. Most of these -- many -- most of these companies have solid backlog and they need technology to help them get the work done. From a value proposition perspective, we are hearing strong resonance with the -- I'd say both the integrated and connected offerings and Trimble Construction One certainly seems to have resonance with the customers that we're talking to, even in its early form that it is. We see that and as evidence of that, we had a record level of cross-sell ACV bookings and building infrastructure in the fourth quarter. So that tells me that there's -- it's not just marketing resonance. It actually has resonance in terms of turning into business. So the value proposition it's around a connected offering. So customers increasingly are looking to move from optimizing tasks to optimizing the system. And to do that, they need to have more connected data and more connected workflows. We are hearing customers say they -- this is -- because this is where they want to go, they want to buy it from one company as opposed to having to stitch together multiple, let's say, multiple vendors on their own. They like the ease of the dealing with the one company or even the one overall account representative. So there's an aspect of ease to doing business with us, meets a level of connectivity which is ultimately they’re trying to get to do their work better, faster, safer, cheaper [indiscernible], and it is resonating.
Kristen Owen: Thanks for that, Rob. And [indiscernible] some of those lessons with Transporeon, how you see maybe some of that value proposition or combining the offerings, how you see that bleeding into the transportation business once that acquisition has closed.
Rob Painter: Yes. Sorry, I forgot about that -- great to. Thanks for the question. So on Transporeon, I'd say the great news of Transporeon is they already have that through the 140,000 carriers. About 1,400 shippers in the network. 3,000 integrations of PRP and [indiscernible] management systems and already last year had $25 million --transactions run through the system. It is definitively a platform company really and in the mode of connect and scale. So they have a set of connected capabilities. They're selling it through a dedicated sales force. There's a land-and-expand play within that. There's strong net retention. There's strong growth retention in the business. So actually, I see as much that we can take from Transporeon to Trimble as much as we -- I think that we could take aspects of Trimble into the Transporeon business, I would like to say, it's 1 of the many reasons I'm excited by that because I think it will be DNA additive to us as where -- and I know this, as we're e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions were additive to us at Trimble to take the best of and take it to other model transitions that we've done. And I see the same thing in store with Transporeon.
Kristen Owen: That’s super helpful. I will leave it there. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will move to our next question from Tami Zakaria at JPMorgan.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. Hope everyone is doing well. So my first question is the gross margin grade expansion 200 to 250 basis points, how much of that is price cost tailwind? And how much of that is software versus hardware mix change? And are there any other factors driving this leverage this year?
David Barnes: Tami, it's David. The way to think about that is essentially all of the gross margin improvement is the evolving mix of our business. We are continuing to take price mostly in hardware, but at a lower rate so that's not real the margin driver. What's driving our margins up is we're becoming more and more of a software business and those have higher gross margins.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. So if prices keep coming down, input prices, could that be a source of up site to your gross margin rate?
Rob Painter: It's -- there's a number of puts and takes in our hardware gross margin. We've already seen a benefit. So in the third and fourth quarter of '22, we got to the point where for our hardware businesses, our price realization more than offset our cost improvements. So that's sort of baked into the run rate now. We are continuing to take pricing at a moderate level in our hardware businesses. So that ought to help our margins just a little bit on the hardware side, but by far bigger story is the mix shift.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. So one quick one. One is to back to the destocking comment. Can you talk about what sales to end users look like in the fourth quarter against the dealer destocking is to date sales to end users overall moderate, and fourth quarter versus the third quarter?
Rob Painter: Yes. So let me frame it up this way. If we look at our dealer destocking, I would say it had a negative approximately 400 basis point impact on our organic revenue trends. So we reported flat. We would have been roughly up 4% without the dealer destocking. So if you look specifically at hardware, our hardware revenues organically were down 13. So I think you can infer, Tami, that there was some market softness, particularly in Geospatial surveying market in Q4, which partly we think is temporal. We had a lot of new products last year and as in many businesses, when you have new products, you get a spike in orders, and we had a clean supply chain to deliver those through. So we've got a bit of a pullback for that reason. Fundamentally, I would say the secular end market sales to retail trends feel up -- maybe not up as much as they were earlier in 2022, but the general direction is up. There's some soft areas, including anything tied directly to residential construction that is clearly contracted. But on the balance with what's happening in infrastructure, we think the secular direction of demand is up. But with the dealer destocking and the customer ordering patterns earlier in '22, we're seeing a pullback for those reasons.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Jason Celino at KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jason Celino: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. So I think you mentioned churn in the first half impacting the ARR growth, what type of customers or what segment are you seeing these come from?
David Barnes: Yes, hey Jason, its David Jason, it's David. We do expect churn from a handful of customers, principally in our Transportation segment. These are customers that made a decision to come off our platforms many quarters ago, and they're just now implementing them. So I see that as noise, not signal our customer satisfaction and retention in transportation is on a secular positive trend. We just expect to see a number of these probably in the first quarter pull off. So that will reduce our ARR growth rate a little bit lower in Q1 from what we expect to see for the full year.
Jason Celino: Okay. And then maybe if I were to simplify it, your construction software portfolio seems to be executing quite well. But it's -- completely different drivers than the hardware destocking element. So are you seeing any macro impact on this construction software portfolio? Thanks.
Rob Painter: The short answer is no, not seeing an impact on the software  Portfolio.
David Barnes: Excellent. Thanks.
David Barnes: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: Yes, good morning, everyone. Rob, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the progress on Trimble construction. One, what proportion of new orders does it account for now? And when we last caught up, you were seeing tripled-AASP versus base orders before. I'm wondering if that trend has continued?
Rob Painter: Hey, Jerry, good morning. It was so, on TC1, the Trimble Construction One, the best evidence I can give you on the progress is that comes in the form of the record level of cross-sell and upsell that we had in the quarter on from an ACV bookings perspective. And the reality is not all of that is the Trimble Construction One branded portfolio. So there are some aspects where we can just sell across the portfolio, which I'd say, a subset really of TC1. That cross-sell is a percent of the total ACV bookings and Buildings & Infrastructure software was nearly 30%. So for us, that's a record dollars, record percentage level. And when we go through the business reviews, we look at almost every account to look at what they're buying and why they're buying it and looking at the competitive win ratios. What we're seeing is when we're selling the bundled offerings, whether it's less than the full TC1 offering or it's TC1 as we're seeing the sales cycles reduce. We're seeing the size of the bookings go up. We're seeing the win ratios go up as well. And so in aggregate, it looks to be a winning formula. And I would add to that, Jerry, that it's still relatively early in the game for us. And so with the sales kickoff meetings that we've been having in the last weeks, it is really a big emphasis to the team. So to get the offering out to the general contractors and then the next person is after that in architecture engineering owners and public sector and then geographically rolling that out as well and aligning the sales team behind that and then actually doing the sales enablement work underneath the covers, which is critical to help the sellers with their effectiveness. So I'd say, Jerry, lots in aggregate or in some, I think lots of good things happening on this front, and we'll keep updating you here every quarter.
Operator: We will go next to Rob Mason at Baird.
Rob Mason: Yes, good morning. First question, I just wanted to clarify a comment from earlier. I think around the cost for Connect and Scale, there was a mention of 100 basis points. Is that -- what is built into the '23 guidance? Or was that the cost for '22? And then maybe just as an extension to that question, just talk about the -- where you've settled now on the -- maybe the model that you're planning to implement on the hardware-software bundles that are transitioning those conversions. I think there were several options presented at the Investor Day. I'm just curious, can you speak to the -- maybe what year 1, year 2 economics will look like on those.
David Barnes: Yes. Hey, Rob. It's David Barnes. I'll try both. On the Connect and Scale discrete investments spending on that '22versus '21 was about 100 basis points around $40 million. Embedded in our guidance for 2023 is a deceleration in the rate of growth. So we'll spend somewhere in the order of another $20 million or a little more than that, $1million incremental, $23 million above $22 million. We still have more to do and we are -- we believe this is a high priority investment. With regard to the model options, I would say the menu that we presented at the Investor Day is still out there. This topic is tied with digital transformation, our ability to sell hardware and software bundles together in recurring basis is heavily dependent on the rollout of our digital transformation. We're doing it in a somewhat [indiscernible] way now, but the bulk of that opportunity is ahead of us and all the options that we showed at the investors still options we're considering.
Rob Painter: And Rob, I want to add just a bit of context too, on top of the Connect and Scale investments because it's a capital allocation call. And so we've taken down spend in other parts of the company, in part to help fund what we're doing here. So we've thought a lot about the cost management aspect of our model. If we look over the last 3 years, organically, ARR has grown double-digit over 12%. Total revenue has grown 6%. The gross margin dollars have grown faster than that, as the mix shifts more software-centric. And our total headcount organically has grown2% over that time frame. So a third of total revenue growth, [indiscernible] of the ARR growth. And so it's very much in context of how we're thinking about allocating capital at Trimble and where we're putting it to work.
Rob Mason: Well, maybe as a follow-on to that, Rob. Transporeon following that completion of that, you will be in somewhat of a deleverage mode, but how much flexibility are you giving yourself or to be able to do a transaction like, I guess, a rivet or something along those lines, I guess, on the capital allocation side to supplement Connect and Scale?
Rob Painter: Let's say, from a flexibility -- if we're talking acquisition and deployment of the balance sheet, I would say here in the next 12 to 18 months, not a lot of flexibility because our primary commitment is to deleverage. So certainly, anything at scale, I would say we've limited some flexibility of the balance sheet. Now if it's not at scale, and so if it's -- whether it's a rivet size acquisition or it's Trimble Ventures, where we put single-digit millions to work. In that aspect, I would say we do retain some flexibility with caution to stay close to making sure we understand our model and that we're taking a relatively conservative view of the balance sheet. Now to the P&L, let's not forget that in 2022, 38% of our total revenue now recurring. $1.6 billion that's grown, we believe will grow double-digit again in next year. So our P&L has more visibility than it's ever had and therefore the business model has got more resilience. And so -- and we maintain the investment grade. So I look at those factors altogether, and I'd say there's [indiscernible] flexibility on a smaller size of capital deployment, not a lot of flexibility on transformative sized deals for the next couple of years.
Rob Mason: Sure. Okay. Thank you.
David Barnes: We'll go next to [indiscernible] at Wolfe Research.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Gal. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on a prior question regarding digital transformation. How is the progress for revenue being transacted through the connected digital platform tracking versus your expectations? And where did that shake out as a portion of revenue for FY '22. At the Investor Day, I believe 2% of revenue had or had been expected to be the target as communicated so as that met or exceeded and do the projections show that your investor base still stands for the portion of revenues expected to transact through the digital platform in the future? And then just 1 brief follow-up. Thanks.
Rob Painter: The short answer is yes. Yes, with the 2% our business in Europe, and that's live and working, and we're just about to roll out the next phased to North American principally to our North American software businesses and with further rollouts from there. But we're moving forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one follow-up. Has anything changed from the time Transporeon was announced that would maybe alter the expectations for revenue and EBITDA initially communicated at the announcement of the acquisition or everything all good there so.
David Barnes: Yes. Look, we've communicated the financial parameters there. We still don't own the business. Obviously, we're talking to them, but we have no update to our outlook, and we'll update that outlook once the transaction closes at some point in the first half of this year.
Rob Painter: Thank you guys.
David Barnes: Sure. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Michael Leyba for closing remarks.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Chris and I will your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer, you may begin.
Rob Painter: Welcome everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Let’s begin on Page 2 with our key messages. Total revenue in the quarter was $885 million, up 6%, yet short of our own higher expectations. Annualized recurring revenue met our expectations and grew 16% to a record level of $1.55 billion. Gross margin finished at a record level of 60.9%, exceeding our expectations. ARR and gross margin are the two-highlight metrics of the quarter. Software, services, and recurring revenue comprised 60% of revenue in the quarter, and 57% on a trailing 12-month basis. EBITDA margins of 25.8% and earnings per share of $0.66 also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. While ARR performed extraordinarily well in the quarter, demand for hardware and associated software fell short, especially late in the quarter. We expect this will continue through the fourth quarter. While detecting the signal through the noise is difficult at the moment, we attribute the weaker hardware demand to two factors. First, we see a relative weakening of overall sentiment, especially in Europe and in other regions negatively impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Second, we see our dealers, in aggregate, moderating their inventory levels in the back half of the year. This reflects their current sentiment, and also factors in some good news from our supply chains, which began to ease up and offer shorter lead times on our products. We see many parts of the global economy through the industries we serve. If we look at the overall economic indicators, I’d say that, in aggregate, the indicators went from great to good. In agriculture, farm income remains high, but so does inflation. In construction, the overall indices are still net positive, but interest rates are beginning to have a negative impact on residential work, and inflation is eating into the increased funding from the U.S. bipartisan infrastructure bill. In transportation, although spot rates in the truckload market have softened due to normalizing demand, freight volume remains steady along with contract rates. Higher fuel prices continue to inflate overall transportation costs, yet trucking margins have remained relatively healthy, due to the strength of freight demand. Managing through these challenging economic and geopolitical landscapes presents a higher level of operational complexity. What is not complex is leading with guiding principles, which for us are threefold. First, we will take actions to exit an expected period of macroeconomic weakness on a stronger competitive footing. Second, we will continue to allocate capital to key areas of the business, such as our digital transformation. Third, we will increase our operational and cost efficiencies and work to reduce our own complexities and redundancies. With that in mind, I will comment on the business through the lens of our operating system, encompassing strategy, people, and execution. Let’s start with strategy. On September 7, we held an Investor Day, where we walked through our Connect and Scale strategy and how it manifests as an industry cloud strategy. We talked about the unifying elements of Trimble and the market opportunity in front of us to digitize and connect some of the most important industries on the planet. We also discussed how our digital transformation will enable connected sales of solutions across a growing portion of our business and shared examples where we are already winning with connected solutions in the market. Finally, we talked about capital allocation and our commitment to transform more of our solution offerings to ratable revenue models, which we firmly believe offers customers more value while expanding the size of our addressable markets. ARR, EBITDA, and cash flow are key metrics for us in the coming years. In the last couple of weeks, we exhibited at the INTERGEO geospatial conference and Bauma construction trade shows, both in Germany, both well attended, and both with high levels of customer engagement. On November 7 through 9, we will hold Trimble Dimensions, our engineering and construction user conference, where we expect over 5,000 customers and partners to come together to connect and inspire transformation in our industry. Moving to people, on October 6, we announced that we changed our corporate headquarters to Westminster, Colorado. We’ve also made some leadership changes. In August, Ron Bisio took over responsibility for our Transportation business. Last week, we announced that Peter Large will take responsibility for all of our construction assets, software and hardware, across civil and building construction.  Our Chief Digital Officer, Mark Schwartz, will take over responsibility for most of our construction software assets; and Pattie-Boothe will take over responsibility for our civil construction business. We now have single points of accountability to deliver outcomes in construction, agriculture, and transportation. Finally, on the topic of execution, let’s review this in the context of our reporting segments. In Buildings and Infrastructure, we acquired Bid2Win on September 9, which is a great fit for our strategy. Bid2Win extends our software capabilities to estimating and operations in the heavy civil construction industry. At the segment level, [ACV bookings] [ph] growth in the quarter exceeded the level of ARR growth, giving us visibility to continued growth. We also continue to see success in cross-selling and up-selling new and existing logos with our early version of Trimble Construction One. We will continue to expand and automate this offering in the months to come. In geospatial, I spent three weeks in the Asia-Pacific region in September and met face-to-face with many customers there. I saw first-hand how they are using our surveying and mapping instruments and software-driven workflows to build the largest infrastructure projects under development in New Zealand and Australia. In Transportation, the business achieved double-digit operating income margin this quarter, for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019. While we still have a lot of work to do, it is worth noting that we are headed in the right direction. In Agriculture, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Bilberry, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter.  Bilberry specializes in selective spraying systems utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning for sustainable farming. We also signed an agreement with CLAAS to develop a next-generation precision farming system for their tractors, combines, and forage harvesters.  We launched our next generation GFX high-resolution touchscreen displays, targeted towards farmers that operate mixed fleets. These GFX displays are compatible with over 10,000 vehicle models across more than 40 equipment brands, and they are ISOBUS-compatible, which allows one display for ISOBUS implements, regardless of manufacturer. Overall, Trimble customers see technology as an increasingly important tool to manage the inflationary and labor shortages they face and to achieve their sustainability commitments. Our bundled solutions represent a unique competitive strength as we compete for our share of the growing industrial technology market. I’ll now turn the call over to David to review our financial results and outlook in greater detail.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue of $885 million was up 6% organically. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 4%, while divestitures net of acquisitions also reduced revenue by 4%. Pricing drove slightly over half of our year-on-year organic revenue growth. Software and recurring revenue continued to grow at a strong rate as reflected by the sequential acceleration of our organic ARR growth.  Ongoing transitions of software models from perpetual to recurring, principally in our Transportation and Buildings and Infrastructure segments, contributed to our ARR momentum, but reduced revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 100 basis points. Hardware revenues grew modestly on an organic basis, enabled by reduced lead times and improving throughput from our supply chain.  Supply chain constraints continue to be dynamic in nature, but our team made good progress in the quarter working around these constraints and executed well in a challenging and unpredictable environment. Bookings for hardware products from our dealers declined sequentially from prior quarters and came in below our expectations, reflecting a softening demand environment in some of our end markets and lower dealer inventories.  Gross margin in the third quarter was a record 60.9%, up 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by an increasingly favorable business mix and the improving net impact of pricing and slowing input cost inflation. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were essentially flat year-over-year, and well above pre-COVID levels. Strong gross margins and lower accruals against our annual incentive plans fully offset the year-on-year impact of spending against our strategic initiatives.  Net income dollars decreased by 3% and earnings per share were flat year-over-year at $0.66 per share. Our trailing 12-month cash flow from operations was $440 million, and free cash flow was $389 million, both of which are down versus prior year. As we outlined in our last earnings call, inventory dynamics and a change in the U.S. tax law are adversely impacting our cash flows in 2022.  Our inventories are well above the levels we held before the supply chain shortages emerged in 2021, as we have been buying to support improved hardware lead times. And a provision in the U.S. tax law has resulted in the amortization of R&D costs for tax purposes beginning in 2022, which has meaningfully impacted the timing of tax payments. We expect both of these unusual factors will reverse in 2023, which will yield significant increases in cash flow and a more normalized relationship between earnings and cash flow going forward.  Note that the underlying working capital dynamics of our business remain strong, with essentially zero net working capital even at our temporarily higher levels of inventory. Notwithstanding a reduction in backlog from improved hardware lead times, we enter the fourth quarter with $1.5 billion in backlog, $1.3 billion of which supports future software, services and recurring revenue.  We ended the quarter with leverage measured as net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.4 times, giving us a resilient capital structure and the flexibility to invest where we see opportunity. This quarter we funded our acquisition of Bid2Win and completed $90 million in share repurchases. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. On this and the next few pages I will focus on organic growth rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency fluctuations. ARR was up 16%, with strong bookings in construction and healthy net retention across our portfolio. Our non-recurring revenue streams grew modestly, with hardware up 3% year-over-year. As Rob mentioned earlier, our non-recurring revenues were below our expectations, driven by weaker end market demand in some markets, especially in Europe, and growing caution among our dealers on how much inventory they want to hold. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 10%. In Europe, where the macro-economic outlook contracted the most, revenues were down 3%. Asia-Pacific was up 4%, and the rest of world was up 21%. Next on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. ARR in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities all grew at a mid-teens or above rate, while Transportation ARR growth was high-single digits and improved sequentially. Let’s turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of our reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12%. Revenue growth was strong across our software businesses in this segment, while our Civil Construction hardware revenue benefited from improved supply chain throughput. Segment ARR was up in the [20’s] [ph] in the quarter. Geospatial segment revenue was up 1% over a very strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 9%, driven by improved throughput from our supply chain, strong demand from OEM customers, and continued growth in our positioning services. Financial results in Transportation showed progression in a number of areas. ARR growth and margins both improved for the fourth quarter in a row. We continue to progress in the conversion of our Transportation Enterprise software business to recurring revenue models. Turning now to Slide 9, I’d like to provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. I’ll start with ARR. Driven by our momentum in bookings and sustained high levels of net retention, our outlook for ARR growth is unchanged from what we shared with you last quarter. We continue to expect organic ARR growth of approximately 16%. Turning to revenue, we now project organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the full-year, which is 300 basis points below the outlook we shared with you in August. For the full-year we expect that changes in foreign exchange rates will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 3%, while divestitures net of acquisitions will also reduce revenue by 3%. We expect operating margins for the full-year of approximately 23%, which is consistent with the range we shared with you in August. Our outlook for gross margins has improved, driven both by an improving business mix and a more positive outlook for pricing and costs. We project that our improving gross margins and strong operating cost control will offset the adverse impact of lower leverage on our fixed costs. Our forecast for income from equity investments is approximately $28 million and net interest costs are estimated to be approximately $66 million. Our tax rate guidance is a range of 18% to 18.5%. Taken in aggregate, we now expect full-year 2022 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.61 and $2.67 per share. From a cash flow perspective, we now expect the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income to be 0.5x to 0.6x for the year, with the primary impacts continuing to be Section 174 tax payments and inventory dynamics. We continue to expect to deliver 2023 free cash flow well above non-GAAP net income as these factors reverse. From a segment perspective, in the fourth quarter we expect organic growth rates to moderate in the Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities segments driven entirely by lower year-on-year revenues from hardware. In the Transportation segment, we expect the growth rate to improve sequentially. ARR growth should remain relatively consistent with recent trends in each of our segments. We expect to issue 2023 guidance in February, but at this point we anticipate a 2023 outlook for double-digit ARR growth and strong cash flow generation. Rob, I’ll turn it back over to you.
Rob Painter: Thanks David. Let me acknowledge that global market conditions have become more difficult. I also think that perspective is important. ARR at $1.55 billion and up 16% is a remarkable achievement and puts us in the upper echelon of technology companies. Our survey, agriculture, and civil construction hardware revenues, when factoring in our current 2022 forecast, have grown at a compound annual growth rate of over 13% since 2019. The data we have suggests that we have gained share in each of these end markets over the last three years, and we remain pleased with our performance and the strategic health of these businesses. Looking forward, we will stay true to our 3-4-3 model, simultaneously balancing a view on 3 months, 4 quarters, and 3 years. In the short-term, we will more tightly manage headcount and discretionary costs, while continuing to transform our business models. In the mid-term, we are planning for persistent economic uncertainty, and we will be sharper on our capital allocation to invest in key areas of the business without cutting into any muscle. In the long-term, the durability of our business is stronger than ever, and our markets are inflecting with the adoption of digital technologies. This remains our moment to Connect and Scale and we are as committed as ever to this strategic journey. Operator, let’s open the line to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning everyone.
Rob Painter: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Rob, I wonder if you can just say a bit more about the ARR performance in the quarter? What was it in buildings and infrastructure in particular and nice to hear about the double-digit outlook into 2023. I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on what's the cadence of bookings growth? Are you seeing maybe into the first half of 2023? You probably have some pretty good visibility on putting a more precise number based on bookings where ARR could track over the next 6 to 9 months? Thanks.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Jerry. So, ARR, for the total company organic was 16% in the quarter and Buildings and Infrastructure was 21% and it was actually also above 20% in the Geospatial reporting segment. So, it's a strong performance overall. ARR arguably is a lagging indicator, the leading indicator is bookings. So, with respect to your question of looking into Q4 and into 2023, when we look at the ACV bookings, contract value bookings that we had in Q3, those grew faster organically in the ARR in the quarter and that's a really solid leading indicator for continued ARR growth to come.
Jerry Revich: Super. And David, can I ask about the fourth quarter? So, obviously, you took down expectations. Normally, when you have a destocking adjustment like we're seeing, you have generally a disproportionate impact on margins in the short-term. Is that playing out in the fourth quarter? Anything we should keep in mind about the earnings cadence off of this fourth quarter levels as we think about the cadence into [2023] [ph], any costs or inefficiencies from making the adjustment that you folks spoke about in the prepared remarks?
David Barnes: Yes, Jerry, I understand your question. There's no real negative margin impact to the outlook we have. In fact, the embedded in our guidance as you do the math, you'll see we expect to have very high gross margins in Q4 even higher than Q3 and that's a function of a business mix, which will be more software centric and we'll have more of the net benefit of the prices we've taken and moderating cost inflation. So, Q4 will be really good from a gross margin perspective.
Jerry Revich: And so the negative revision to full-year operating margins, was the third quarter versus your model, David?
David Barnes: This is a little bit of, I'll call it [noise] [ph] between Q3 and Q4 with the reduction in our outlook or forecast for the year, we brought down our accrual against our incentive comp. So, just the incentive comp helped Q3 margins by a little under 200 basis points and that gets normalized in Q4. So, that's really the driver of the expectation of lower margins in Q4 than Q3, but the underlying gross margins will be better and the OpEx as a percent of revenue will look higher, but that's the impact of the accounting for the bonus plans.
Jerry Revich: Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you. The next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi. Thanks and good morning everybody. Rob, I wonder if you could just drill down a little bit more on where you're seeing it going from great to good and the hardware weakness. I mean, I guess it wouldn't be surprising to see Europe or [European ag] [ph], but I don't know what sounds like maybe you're seeing more than just that. So, that's just a starting point. I think the quarter has generally been pretty okay across industrials and it seems like you're seeing a few more spots of weakness?
Rob Painter: Hey, good morning, Rob. Hey, the first comment on the great to good was at the overall company level. If I think about the dynamics and hardware revenue, let's say, compared to other companies that you're following. Let's talk about retail versus the wholesale and then I think you also have to take into account units and pricing. So, at a retail sell-through like visibility we have is that the retail sell-through is quite solid. So, actually dealers are bringing down inventory levels, but the retail demand is still there. So, what I would characterize in my sentiment is that the goodness is still there. So, our – and I've seen some others, the revenue in their third quarters was more to wholesale demand, meeting wholesale demand. In other words, building up dealer inventory at AR as we saw dealer inventory reduction, but the retail demand was a sell-through. And then with respect to pricing in units, I think one thing that to me I'd characterize in the good side for our hardware business is, we're getting still a fair amount of our growth that's happening through unit growth. So, this is not all pricing. And then another just thing in terms of setting perspective overall from the – if I go – we are going back to 2019 is, we've got a CAGR of 13% in [some of] [ph] our survey agriculture and civil construction hardware revenue. So, if I expand the horizon a bit, I can still see through what has been a very positive track record in the business. So that's – Rob, that's how they come to the great to good and [indiscernible] to your question. Let me know if you have a follow-up.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes. Rob, that's helpful. Is the dealer conservatism geographically in product equal or is it concentrated or heavily concentrated in a couple of products or regions?
Rob Painter: Well, for sure concentrated in Europe as a geography. And then if I took it at a product level, I'd say a mix of civil construction and agriculture.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in line.
Operator: The next question is from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Good morning. Transportation margin, you called that out as having been one of the highest since 2019. Clearly, there's some seasonality that we would expect to see in 3Q, but I'm wondering if you can talk about some of the successes that you're seeing in that business, where we are in terms of net new business and how we should think about the exit rate for that segment just given some of the changes you've made over the last two years? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Good morning, Kristen. Yes, so, I guess a couple more data points in there, sequential growth in ARR. Our gross margins are the highest in that business since Q4 of 2018. Our OpEx is at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2020. We've seen net retention in a pretty good place. In the enterprise business, I think of, essentially more of the ERP side of the transportation business. We continue conversions from our customers from on-prem to cloud. So, I like what we're doing there and we're moving more of our bookings, continue to move more of the bookings to subscription bookings. So, that's a positive for us and actually that's of course that's a headwind to the margin. So, they would have been a probably 150 bps to 200 bps higher or not for that. So, if I look at the quantitative side of the house there, I like a level of the momentum or at least a direction, maybe I should call direction that the business is moving. The mapping business that we have continues to perform extraordinarily well both in North America and in Europe. At our User Conference in August, we announced a number of new products integrations that we have, including the engage lane technology, which is coming out of some work that we have done with Procter & Gamble. So, a number of good things happening, Kristen.
Kristen Owen: That's helpful and encouraging to hear. The follow-up question that I have is just around capital allocation location. You're now at nearly 400 million shares repurchased for the year, just remind us how you think about repurchases relative to intrinsic value expectations? Thank you.
David Barnes: Yes. Hey, Kristen, it's David. We have a model where we're looking at our cash flow with some moderation this year. We're a cash flow generating business. We did some divestitures earlier in the year. And we look to make sure we have the right capital structure for our business and fund our growth plans and we use a matrix when the share price comes down that gives us an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive. Over time, the focus of our capital allocation is on growth and we won't have share repurchase get in the way of giving us firepower to invest in growth. Our leverage at 1.4x is actually below where we think we could be on a long-term basis. And so, we were comfortable bumping it up a little bit based on all those variables.
Kristen Owen: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Tami Zakaria with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, my first question is, this may be a little early to ask this, but how are you thinking about gross margin next year as cost inflation is retreating? Can you remind us how much of margin headwind you saw, let's say, in the past couple of years from cost inflation alone? And can you – do you expect to recapture most of it maybe over the next 12 to 18 months?
David Barnes: Yes. Hey, Tami, it's David. I'll start by saying, I'm going to be careful not to give 2023 guidance. We will do that in February, but I'll talk about some broad trends that I think are likely to influence our margins going forward. On the gross margin side, we think there's a macro trend here of higher growth in our software businesses and recurring, which has higher gross margins. So that will help us. We think with humility that the world is uncertain, but we're past the peak of input cost inflation on the hardware side. We've taken price, I'll say some of you are comparing us with other industrial companies. We've taken actually less price if you just look as a percentage price increase than some of the big industrial players. And we think that makes sense given our economics and our focus on staying competitive, but we think within hardware, we'll see continued moderation of costs and we'll have pricing that can keep up with that maybe do a little bit better. With that said, we're investing against our strategic priorities that we mentioned in the Investor Day. And so, I think we have some levers to pull on with regard to margin. As Rob mentioned in his commentary, we're looking at the softening demand environment and we're being increasingly careful and prudent in our costs. We are every day, every month looking at our internal resource capital allocation. We've slowed down the rate of our hiring and our cost additions and we will continue to be really prudent understanding that the demand environment next year is going to be hard to predict. So, hopefully that gives you the picture you need. We'll have more to say about this in February.
Tami Zakaria: It does. It was very helpful. Thank you. And then a second quick one. Europe, I think organic growth was negative in the quarter. You call that civil construction and Ag demand, I think, you call that as moderating. Did you see order trends sequentially get worse quarter to date versus 3Q? I guess what I'm trying to understand is, when do you think Europe can – how long do you think Europe will stay in the negative territory before it, sort of inflects and bounces back?
Rob Painter: Hey, good morning, Tami. This is Rob. So, that's a great question and I wish I had a crystal ball for everything you're asking inside that. Hey, the level set on the Q, the organic growth was about minus 3%. But I first want to make a note on that is that includes our Russia and Ukraine business, which went away. So, we adjust for that and we were a positive 2% organic in the quarter. So, that's where we put our Russia and Ukraine numbers. And so, we haven't to try to make adjustments for that in any of the organic like we called it as it was. So, that loss of that business has been a negative for us both in Europe and obviously at the company level as well. Now, the Europe growth is slower than what we saw organically, and rest of world, which is up [20%] [ph], which is mostly Brazil, APAC was higher than that in North America at around 10% organic level. I think there's an aspect first is the dealer inventory reset. So, I think to really get ground truth as I go back to separating the retail and the wholesale demand. I'll say it is confusing at the moment. I'm a bit uncertain out there. We walked away from the trade shows where we spend a lot of time with engineering construction customers predominantly European based at the two shows at the Intergeo and Bauma and actually sentiment and engagement in attendance was very high. We look at infrastructure projects, the HS2, the Grand Paris. There is infrastructure work happening in Europe. So, in that sense, I'm positive on continued business in Europe residential I think is turning. Markets like EPC work are, I think will be solid for obvious reasons in Europe, but those do take time. Farm income and farm sentiment, that has a [indiscernible] sort of correlate to harvest and whether as that comes together, it ended up being a harder year for European farmers than I think they thought earlier in the year. As you know, there was – so that was pretty dry in Europe and then that impacted sentiment. So, we'll see how they [feel] [ph], let's say, coming into the spring planting season. So, there's little – some winds going, but winds going both ways in Europe at the moment. But hey, despite all of that, I go back to what do we do at Trimble, we sell productivity and sustainability and I think the value proposition of technology is just as important as ever.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That's super helpful color. Thank you.
Rob Painter: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Erik Lapinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erik Lapinski: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one on, kind of operating margins more at the segment level and focusing on geospatial because that was particularly strong in the quarter. I guess just trying to understand maybe better the driver there, given revenue didn't increase as much? I know it's more, kind of hardware oriented. So, volume, I typically think of as the driver there. So, maybe if you could help us, kind of understand just that side of it?
David Barnes : Yes. Hey, Erik, it's David. Margins were particularly good in geospatial and that's mostly a mix issue within the offerings and we think that's a little bit better than we're going to have in Q4. So, it's just a mix of the products that we sell and what we shipped in Q3 was particularly high margin.
Erik Lapinski: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then also you did mention some success on the recurring offerings within the geospatial segment. Can you maybe give us some color on to exactly, kind of where you're seeing that success? I know that's been an initiative for you guys.
David Barnes: Sure. Well, in the – of the four segments, the geospatial does start with the lowest base. So, in terms of percentage increase to be intellectually honest, it's coming off that lower base. And the team deserves credit for the pivoting of the business model. So, when you buy our instruments and sensors like the hardware centric part of geospatial, so think the surveyors and the [Mappers] [ph] out there in the world, they're buying workflow, actually, they're not just buying an instrument and that workflow includes software. So, we have Trimble business and Trimble access. So, these field to finish workflows that the field needs or if you're doing scanning data or mobile mapping, data collection, you need to be able to process that data. So, the software that we have in that business is being converted more into ratable models, which we think is expands the size of the addressable market, turns the CapEx and the OpEx is helping us as a catalyst to move more of the work into to the cloud. So, in that sense, Erik, yes, I think it's a very good example of connect and scale at play.
Erik Lapinski: Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Jason Celino: Great. Thanks. Two quick ones for me. You know, there's been lots of questions on hardware already, but maybe I’ll ask it a different way. So, hardware was down 11% in Q3. And then Q4, I think you said it will be down high-single-digits. Maybe this is just the function to compare, but I guess why? Why wouldn't or, I guess, high single-digit decline is [indiscernible]?
David Barnes: Yes. Hey, Jason. I'll point out that really important when you look at hardware to get the organic math in your mind. And that's both FX and we divested businesses, which were heavily hardware centric. So, actually if you look at the organic numbers, hardware revenues were up 3% year-on-year in Q3. And that does reflect that we were – our product supply improves a lot and we were able to draw down the backlog and meet the dealer needs where we've had extraordinarily long lead times. So, that having said, embedded within our guidance is that hardware organic revenues are likely to be down in the fourth quarter and it's driven by all the dynamics Rob mentioned.
Jason Celino: Okay. Perfect. No. That's actually very helpful. And then Rob, you know, two quarters in a row, 20% [indiscernible] in B&I and the leading indicators with ACV also look good, how much of the strength do you think is from some of the new bundling efforts versus strong environment for [construction market] [ph]? Thanks.
Rob Painter: Good morning, Jason. I think there's some growth in that. Our crossed up bookings and part of the business within B&I that's selling Trimble Construction One, we saw over 20% of our ACV bookings coming from cross-sell. And as we've talked about at Investor Day, we're still very early in the work with TC1, I’m expanding that offering into different geographies and broadening the scope and the automation of the offering. So, I think that there's only tailwinds behind the business model aspect of that. And then if I flip it around, let's say, for the rest of the business. The software side at B&I does have incrementally more American centricity to it, which is the healthiest of the four geographies that we report. So that, I think would also help that as well.
Jason Celino : All right. Thanks.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: The next question is from Gal Munda with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Gal Munda: Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. The first one, maybe Rob, if you think, you mentioned in Europe the infrastructure is actually looking quite good, but if I want to try to think about the infrastructure opportunity, right now in the way you've seen potentially, especially in the U.S., have you seen any of the tailwind from IIJA’s starting to come in or do you think that's something that could actually start being material to the business as we move into the 2020?
Rob Painter: Hi, good morning, Gal. So, we do continue to feel that the IIJA versus now, I guess, BIO, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, [indiscernible] that's gone into law. We continue to believe it's a positive catalyst for business. And that 10% organic growth in overall North America at the total company level clearly has a B&I and geospatial aspect to that. So, call that engineering and construction if we up level. Money is starting to flow from the federal government to the states.  When you look again at the state level, some states actually have multiple funding sources for their infrastructure like they're not entirely dependent on the incremental money from the Fed. And that's interesting to us because there are subset of states in the U.S. that are, I'd say, they're at work already and we're seeing good activity from those states.  If I take the majority of the states though, I think one of the things that's on the headwind side of the infrastructure bill is that material cost and labor cost are eating into some of the increased amount of the funding. And there still does seem to be a lag between the funding mechanism and the work actually starting to happen. And so, we feel like there's been a lag and we're not really seeing the fruits of it at, at a – let's say a level we might have expected at this point. So, now you weren't asking so much about 2022 as looking forward. So, if we go into next year, I think that that does provide us, let's say, a certain level of ballast to the business and our sentiment certainly for the North American side of Trimble engineering and construction. 
Gal Munda: That makes sense. Thank you. And then if I think about the pricing that you've mentioned as being, kind of one of the drivers and especially on the gross margin side, but if I take a step back and just think about the pricing in general, can you talk a little bit more about what you found on the pricing maybe when you look at hardware versus software split? Have you done any significant price increases in the software side or are you planning to do anything there as we ramp the next year? Thank you.
David Barnes: Hey Gal, it’s David. So, we've taken more pricing in hardware than software. Software pricing is a little, sort of amorphous because you're always adding more features and how much do you attribute to more functionality versus the price. It's been our practice to increase pricing over time in our software businesses and we've [uped] [ph] that a little bit with the inflationary environment, but more of our price increases have been against our hardware.  And just to put some numbers around it, if you look year-on-year and we've taken several ways of price increases. Across our hardware portfolio, our prices year-on-year are up about 6%. So that's the rate of headline inflation. Good news for us is that the rate of inflation of our cost is actually less than that. So, we're getting some hardware margin benefit from the net impact of [pricing and cost] [ph]. But the pricing on the software is less than [six] [ph], where you can think of that in the low single digits or little less than 5% pricing on our software.
Gal Munda: That's really helpful. Thank you, David.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on your ARR growth and whether that's coming from net expansion versus new customers, as well as whether there's been any, sort of change in that dynamic?
Rob Painter: Good morning, Jonathan. Hey, it's Rob. So, there's certainly a number of, let's say, levers directions where we've seen the ARR grow. So, first, I'll take expanding the size of the addressable market and our best example of that is from our SketchUp product within buildings and infrastructure. I think we're going on 13 or 14 quarters in a row of more than 40% ARR growth in that business is really remarkable. So, kudos to the team on that. And you're not doing that through pricing, you're doing that through unit and where those kind of unit growth, that's a clear sign to us of expanding the size of the addressable market. We weren't expanding units at that level prior to the model conversion. We see it in our [indiscernible] business, as well as that we're seeing unit growth, which we think is showing a sign of expanding the size of addressable market. Second, I could put in a category of say, general market uplift or adoption of technology. You can argue that's riding a wave, so to speak, of digitization and the market that provides a certain level of growth in the ARR and the business. The third category I would call the cross-sell, and when we really get to the economics of the connected scale strategy and think about the 1.55 billion of ARR we're sitting on top of, we think that there's a couple hundred million plus of ARR to be mined, just from within the portfolio we have. And so, as I think about economic scenarios if the economy were to take a turn for the worse, you know your classic play is to look what the customers you have and rethink the amount of capital you're putting to new logo generation. So, I'm optimistic that whatever the scenario is that there's a lot to be done from within our own portfolio. And I'll say that fourth and last category is straight up new logo growth. So, the sum of those to me is the sum of parts that gets to the total company level.
Jonathan Ho: That's helpful. And then you mentioned a number of management and leadership transitions at the beginning. Can you talk a little bit more about the dynamics there and maybe what you were, sort of looking for as you were, I guess, making some changes at the second tier management level? Thank you.
Rob Painter : Well, I'd say congratulations to the folks who are stepping into new roles. 100% believers in them and the work that they've got ahead of them. So, I think that change can be a good thing. Change provides opportunity. Change provides a chance for a fresh look at some things. Sometimes leadership transitions, I'd say, are – that's the right thing for the business. And as you proactively make them other times, you're reacting because somebody decides to leave the organization. So, there's a little bit of both of those that provide a backdrop in context for the transitions that we have in mind. The tone I'd want to set on the transitions that we have is that it's about executing connect and scale at the strategy level. Our operating system talks about strategy, people and execution. So, the strategy is to connect and scale manifesting through these industry clouds that we're building, bringing the best capabilities we have together. So, our leaders, all of us, myself included every single one of our operators and folks who work to support the operators are working to build the product offering to meet this platform and industry cloud direction that we're going. At a people level, we aim to continue to be the employer of choice and technology and our rankings in that area continue to be world-class.  So, I expect some leaders to lead, to inspire, to engage, to achieve. And then we've got to meet our numbers on the execution and so you know how much weight we put towards the ARR growth in the business. When we talk about our three key metrics, we're talking about ARR, EBITDA, and cash flow. So, we have to not just talk in package, we have to deliver, and we have to deliver in an environment that's got an increasing level of uncertainty around it. So, that's the expectation I have for the leaders who were in their roles and I got a great deal of belief in them to be able to do so.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you so much.
Rob Painter: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Chad Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys.
Rob Painter: Hi, Chad.
Chad Dillard: So, I just want to circle back on your implied guidance for gross margins in the fourth quarter and just how to think about that exit rate, just given that, it sounds like mix will be a tailwind, you get a little bit better price cost and start to think about that as a starting point as we look towards 2023?
David Barnes: Hey Chad, it's David. As you do through the math, go through the math and look at our guidance, you'll see that we expect meaningful improvement in gross margins from Q3 to Q4 and that's driven by a mix, our hardware revenues even organically will be down in the fourth quarter for all the reasons that Rob mentioned. So, the software to hardware mix is going to improve and we have the benefit within hardware, particularly of a favorable mix between pricing and cost. So that gets you to gross margins. OpEx as a percent of revenue will be higher because we had – we have the bonus impact that I described to an earlier question where we had, call it, no bonus expense in Q3. That's the way the approval works. We also have some step-up in OpEx Q3 to Q4 sequentially. It’s the way holiday's work in Europe and we have a big user conference coming up. So, those dynamics will drive our OpEx as a percent of revenue, higher in Q3 and Q4 with lower revenue unit that all out we expect operating margins to be lower in Q4 versus Q3.
Chad Dillard: Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe, if you could just spend some time just talking about the impact of the digital transformation that you've been embarking on for the last 12 months. Just trying to think about the incremental spend from, I guess 2021, 2022 and then just any early thoughts on how you think about that as we go into this coming year and just the cadence of the expected benefit?
David Barnes: Yes. We are – I'll say the guidance, the framework we provided earlier in the year and last quarter still holds we're investing against our digital transformation and a handful of other strategic initiatives at a rate that's about 100 basis points of margin. So, that's what it was in Q3. And that's what it will be in Q4. We're looking harder at OpEx everywhere, but as Rob said, what we're not doing is changing our fundamental priorities and progressing against the digital transformation is absolutely at the top of our strategic list. So, that you can call that pressure is there and we're managing to hold our model within the context of sustaining that investment going forward.
Chad Dillard: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: Yes, good morning everyone. Apologies if this has been asked. I’m toggling back and forth between calls, but there was the commentary around your backlog, I think David, I inferred about 200 million of hardware backlog, I'm just curious if that's the right number? And then two is, how are you thinking about where dealers are in terms of rightsizing their inventory? Just the dynamic there, is this situation that can be resolved, do you think here between third quarter and fourth quarter or does it stretch beyond that?
David Barnes: Yes. So, I'll start with the numbers. You're about right. Our hardware backlog went from about 240 million at the end of last quarter to 180 million so down 60 million, which is a good thing that reflects the fact that our supply chain is improving. Pre-COVID, pre-supply chain, that number was closer to a hundred. So, we will move in that direction, although I'm not sure we’ll ever get back to where it was because supply chains are likely to be different for everybody going forward. As far as dealer dynamics, it's a very dynamic situation. It varies dealer-to-dealer market-to-market. I'd say overall most dealers are about where they have been and probably about where they want to be. As Rob mentioned, the dealers are looking at their markets and are seeing some uncertainty and so their sort of set point for inventory is going down and that's somewhat accelerated by the fact that our supply chain has now gotten so good, not universally, but for most of our products, we have order lead times measured in days, not months. And so, the need to hold a bunch of inventory for the dealer is less than it was. So, it's a mix. There are some dealers that are looking at uncertainty in their markets and will be inclined, particularly with our good supply chain to bring inventories down and some are in very good shape.
Rob Mason: And just with respect to the agriculture business, there was commentary in the slides around softening demand in Europe, but did you comment on North America and how that market is faring for you?
Rob Painter: Well, hey, Rob, this is the other Rob. In the Ag business overall, actually the majority of our business, I want to frame is outside of North America today. So, strong double-digit growth in Brazil, really in South America, continued growth in Asia Pacific. Overall organically, the business was up in the high-single-digits for agriculture. So, I think North America is holding its own as the punch line on that, but I want to put North America in the context of the bigger picture.
Rob Mason: Very good. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions. At this time, I'll turn it over to Michael Leyba for any closing remarks.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this quarter. We look forward to speaking to you again soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Trimble Incorporated Financial Results Conference Call. Please note, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Painter, you may begin your conference.
Rob Painter : Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. I will lead the call today as David is at home on the back end of the COVID quarantine. Jim Todd, our head of FP&A is in the room with me, and the 3 of us will handle the Q&A. My commentary on revenue and ARR growth today will reflect organic performance, thereby excluding our acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency movements. Let's begin on Page 2 with our key messages. Our team delivered a record second quarter, exceeding our own expectations. My congratulations to our team and our global partners. Annualized recurring revenue grew 15% and we now stand at $1.51 billion of ARR. Total revenue was up 6%, also ahead of expectations, as was gross margin of 59.7%, a record level for Trimble. This flowed through to exceeding our expectations on EPS. The Trimble operating system balances strategy, people and execution. We have been busy the last few months, demonstrating progression and proof points on many fronts. On strategy, we are seeing solid progress with our Trimble Construction One offering, which is a bundled offering of our construction software solutions currently targeted towards contractors. We tried to start with this segment of Trimble customers as we have the value proposition and momentum on our side. From this new baseline, we will expand to other personas and construction such as architects and designers and owners, and we will roll out the offering on a more global basis. We will then extend this approach across our other applicable businesses. Our indicators are telling us that with Trimble Construction One, our win rates are going up, our sales cycles are becoming shorter and our average deal size is increasing. We also see progress in cross-selling efforts with more than 20% of our construction software bookings coming from cross-sell in the second quarter, which is increasing our share of wallet and penetration into our installed base. From a capital allocation perspective, we divested 5 businesses in the quarter, where the revenue profile was greater than 90% hardware that was not core to driving connected value in our industry clouds. This included product lines such as own goods, safety best, land scales and rotating lasers. In the quarter, we made the decision to exit the Russian market and we repurchased 200 million of our shares. Our priority remains investing back into our business and pursuing acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline is relatively full at the moment, and we have the firepower to act. On people, we were recently named a top company for leadership and global culture in a survey by Comparably. We also appointed Ron Bisio to oversee our transportation and logistics business. Ron is a 23-year Trimble veteran, and has led the growth and transformation of our survey business over the last few years. Ron is an excellent leader and his mandate is to execute our strategy faster. James Langley will redirect his focus to his biggest area of strength, which is his understanding of the needs of customers in the overall market. On execution, we continue to simplify our portfolio through actions such as reducing the number of part numbers and product offerings. We are building resilience for future products by designing more of our new hardware offerings to have dual sourcing capabilities on key components. With respect to our digital transformation, I am pleased with the cadence of delivery on the process and systems front, which we need in order to increase the velocity and scalability of our Trimble Construction One and cross-selling efforts. Our current technology stack is deployed in France and Benelux as a test market. Our most recent release gives our customers the ability to buy and add multiple products on a single contract, and gives our sellers the ability to sell across the breadth of our portfolio from a single go-to-market team. This release gives us visibility across the entire customer and prospect base, driving a true customer 360 view in 1 system and providing us accurate metrics and KPIs from a single source of truth. From here, we will continue to refine and add functionality and extend the other geographies, including North America, which will happen in the first half of next year. Changing gears, I have met with a few dozen customers, well more than 1,000 Trimble employees and many investors over the last few weeks, including a 3-week visit throughout Europe. Our team believes in our connect-and-scale journey, and I am grateful that they are willing to challenge us to execute better and faster. Our customers are validating our direction. They are asking for help to unlock more digital insights and to integrate data and workflows across multiple products to drive even more value. They have efficiency and sustainability at the top of their agendas, along with access to qualified labor and inflationary pressures to manage in the near term. They are also asking us to be easier to do business with as they want to more broadly access our technology. On the investor front, the topic has been almost singular, that is the macroeconomic environment and recessionary clouds. Broadly speaking, market indicators and demand remain strong on an absolute basis. On a relative basis, it seems that our end markets are catching their breath and coming off a bit of a high point. Inflation is a top concern. In Engineering & Construction, we watch signals such as construction backlog, the Architectural Billing Index, Dodge Momentum Index, as well as signals from our own systems. In Agriculture, we look at equipment sales, commodity prices, inventory levels and farm income. In Transportation, we look towards freight demand, capacity utilization, freight rates and fuel prices. These indicators remain net favorable on an absolute basis. Overall, Trimble is much more secular than cyclical in nature. After all, productivity and efficiency are needed more than ever in challenging markets. To help investors appreciate the resilience of Trimble, let's turn to Page 3, and let the facts speak to the quality of the Trimble business model. Over the last 10 years, we have moved our business from 20% to 55% software services and recurring revenue. That represents over $2 billion today in these differentiated revenue streams that uniquely enable us to connect the physical and digital worlds. Over that same time period, we have moved from $361 million of ARR to $1.51 billion of ARR, a 15% CAGR. We believe this is the most resilient of our revenue streams, and it continues to grow at a healthy double-digit level.  Finally, we have expanded EBITDA margins from 19.9% to 25.6% over this time frame, and we were doing this with an increasingly asset-light business model that operates with negative working capital. The overall point here is simple: if we enter a recession, we have never been better positioned to navigate. Our mindset in this environment, therefore, is to continue to execute our strategy. We are playing the long game, and we will also be prudent with managing our expenses. Our headcount since the beginning of the year has gone up by approximately 2% organically, and we will remain vigilant to allocate our capital and manage our operating expenses in line with our most compelling opportunity sets. Turning now to the quarter and our numbers on Page 4. I'll start by making the point that normal seasonality and year-over-year quarterly comparisons are a bit incomplete as the pandemic and supply chain shortages have altered historical patterns as have our recent divestitures and adverse movements in FX. Second quarter revenue was $941 million, up 6% organically. Revenue in the quarter was aided by strong performance through our supply chain as we were able to reduce hardware backlog and improve lead times across most of our hardware offerings. Gross margin expanded by 150 basis points to 59.7%, driven by a favorable mix shift towards software offerings and the net impact of pricing and cost. The year-on-year rate of product cost inflation eased modestly in the quarter and came in better than our expectations. As supply chain initiatives implemented over the last several quarters have allowed us to reduce our reliance on both expedited transportation and the expensive broker market for scarce parts. We are seeing meaningful improvement overall in the reliability of our supply chain, but significant issues remain, and we don't expect a fully normalized supply chain environment until well into 2023. We faced a number of critical part shortages that reduced our ability to meet customer demand in the second quarter, and those issues will continue to modestly constrain our revenue for the remainder of 2022. EBITDA and operating margins for the quarter were 24.2% and 22.4%, respectively. Operating costs grew versus year ago levels, driven both by the gradual normalization of travel expenses and by the planned investments we are making against our strategic growth initiatives. Net income and EPS were both lower than prior year levels, yet ahead of our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have generated $470 million of free cash flow, and through the first half of 2022, we generated just over $173 million of free cash flow, both of which are below our long-term goal of generating cash flow in excess of our non-GAAP net income. The main 2 factors impacting second quarter cash flow are the build-up of inventory, driven by supply chain disruptions and tax payments related to the elimination of upfront tax expensing of R&D costs in the U.S. We expect both of these items to normalize over time. Meanwhile, we are operating with negative working capital. Turning to Page 5. The highlight metric is the 15% growth in ARR, which reflects strength in bookings, high net retention and the continued conversion of our perpetual software offerings. Hardware revenue grew at a rate of 3% versus a very strong second quarter of a year ago, while perpetual software revenues were down modestly, driven in part by our ongoing model conversions. Geographically, North America revenue was up 8%. Europe was up 1%. The loss of business in Russia and Ukraine reduced Europe revenue growth by 5 percentage points. Asia Pacific was up 5% and rest of world was up 22%. Looking at the highlighted metrics on Page 6, we have covered many of these already. I'll comment on our backlog, which stands at $1.6 billion of which approximately $240 million is hardware. Hardware backlog came down by approximately $110 million in the quarter, about half from divestitures and half from improving supply chain execution. Before the COVID-induced supply chain disruption, our hardware backlog was typically around $100 million, so we are still a good distance from normal backlog dynamics. We have also returned cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program with 445 million of share repurchases on a trailing 12-month basis. We ended the quarter with net debt just slightly over 1x EBITDA, leaving us with the capital structure, which provides both resilience and ample dry powder to invest against our strategy. Turning now to segment trends on Page 7. We had a very strong quarter in Buildings & Infrastructure with 13% organic revenue growth and over 20% organic ARR growth. We had strong bookings and net retention across our software offerings in this sector. Our Civil Construction business, which has a meaningful hardware component, benefited both from strong demand and improving supply chain execution. In our Geospatial segment, we came into the quarter with an expectation of lower year-on-year organic growth due to the comparison with the unprecedented strength in the second quarter of last year. Organic revenue was down 5% reflecting both tough comps and some acute component shortages. Demand for our survey offerings remains strong, and the combination of growing bookings and supply chain challenges resulted in backlog remaining at an elevated level through the quarter. Resource and Utilities organic revenue grew by 15% in the second quarter, reflecting a significantly improved supply chain situation for most of our agriculture products. Transportation organic revenue was down 5% on a year-over-year basis and was below our expectations, driven primarily by lower hardware sales to North American customers. While the financial results for transportation have remained below our expectations, there were a number of positive developments in the quarter that position our business for improved trends in 2023 and beyond. ARR grew in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate, representing sequential improvement in the rate of growth. Our churn of mobility customers was lower in the second quarter than in any quarter since late 2018. The performance of our ELD software is now very strong and customer satisfaction has improved significantly. We have announced our new mobility product to the market and are actively engaging with both existing customers and new logos. I'll now turn to our outlook for 2022 on Page 8. We are raising our guidance on ARR growth to 16% for the year as our conviction on the underlying drivers of growth has increased. For the metrics of total revenue and EPS, 3 factors lead us to project a more cautious outlook for the full year: FX, supply chain and demand. This weighs approximately 1/2 FX and 1/2 supply chain and demand. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar over the last 90 days has obviously been significant. Fortunately, our cost base is quite global and creates a natural hedge, leaving us with only a modest residual exposure to foreign exchange on operating margins. While supply chains are demonstrably better, and we hold our previous conviction on gross margin improvement in the second half of the year, it only takes 1 component to prevent a product from shipping, and we are facing some critical component shortages that we believe will impact our geospatial and Resources and Utilities segments. On the demand front, we are seeing modestly lower-than-expected ordering across the transportation and agriculture sectors. Farmer sentiment has moderated in the face of high input cost inflation. Incorporating these factors, we expect revenue in the range of $3.76 billion to $3.82 billion, which reflects an outlook for the full year organic total revenue growth of 9% to 11%. Overall revenue growth and organic revenue growth are expected to improve sequentially from the second quarter through the third and fourth quarters, reflecting increased pricing and increased software and recurring growth. Note that the impact of our divestitures on our revenue will be approximately 5% in both the third and fourth quarters. If foreign exchange rates remain where they are now, we expect a negative impact on revenue of approximately 4% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins are expected to sustain the improvement we saw in the second quarter into the second half of the year, primarily -- driven primarily by pricing but also by moderating supply chain costs. Our outlook for full year operating margins remains at 23% to 23.5%. The high point for both gross margin and operating margin for the year is expected to be in the fourth quarter. Our revised full year EPS range is $2.70 to $2.80. We expect the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income to come in around 0.7x for the year, impacted by the aforementioned R&D expensing change under the U.S. tax code and inventory dynamics. It is likely these factors will reverse, and we would expect to deliver free cash flow well above non-GAAP net income in 2023. Conclusion, the financial story for the second quarter was revenue, ARR and gross margin outperformance. For the year, the punchline is seeing through currency movements, divestitures and some choppiness in the macro environment to highlight that we are raising our view on ARR growth to 16% and guiding organic revenue growth between 9% to 11%. In the second half of the year, we expect to build on our second quarter momentum with sequential improvements in organic growth and gross margin through both the third and fourth quarters. Strategically speaking, the resilience of our business is stronger than ever. Our markets are inflecting with the adoption of digital technologies. This is our moment to connect at scale, and we remain committed to this journey. Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc.
Jason Celino: So Rob, the Construction One platform, nice to hear the strong performance. I'm curious, though, where are you seeing the most traction. Is it with current customers potentially looking to upgrade and expand or is it with some of the new net wins that you talked about in your prepared remarks?
Rob Painter: The majority of the growth, I would say, at the moment is coming from the existing customer base. And that's actually pretty logical from our perspective when we've done the work within our own portfolio. We think there's enormous opportunity to cross-sell and upsell within the customer base. So one of the things that the team has done an excellent job of moving existing customers to Trimble Construction One contract offerings such that they've got an on-ramp to consuming more of the technology. At a net new logo perspective, the team is winning net new logos as well. So -- that is -- I think it's showing some early signs of success. But the bulk and the majority is from existing customers at the moment.
Jason Celino: And then I think you mentioned at the beginning that the logic or the premise is to take this type of bundling sweet style approach to some of your other segments.
Rob Painter: Yes, exactly, Jason. So right now, we're working in the -- actually the contractor persona within construction and actually really even within building construction, most specifically, then we'll look towards architects and designers. As a persona, we have a bundled offering with TC1, a suite targeted to them than a suite targeted to owners. Trimble Construction One will also apply to our Civil business, where we can connect what we're doing in the field with office on a singular contract. And then in parallel, but at some level, we'll play out a little bit more serially, as with our transportation business and the agriculture business. So it's absolutely consistent mindset we have across the business as we pursue this platform strategy.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Rob, I had kind of a higher-level question. I mean, there's a lot happening in infrastructure construction may actually get going. There's a bunch of kind of mega projects out there that were in the past. And I wonder if you could just kind of assess the strategic landscape for you and your competitors, whether the collection of offerings that you have and are now protecting scaling, is evolving as fast as your competition? Do you anticipate this to be the next 2 or 3 or 4 years that are highly dynamic on acquisitions to get a range portfolio where they want, or is that not necessarily a moment that needs to see people change radically. Just really if you could just assess how you're evolving versus your competitors in the construction landscape.
Rob Painter: Well let me give you a perspective, more at the mega project level and with some of the largest customers. Because as you know, I mean, there's a segmentation by size of customer. I met this largest customer level I have actually had a chance to meet with a number of them recently and to meet with customers who are working on some of these mega projects, both in the U.S. and throughout Europe. There's no question from my perspective that customers -- these big customers on the big projects are looking to bring the multiple technologies they have together into a common data environment and I think we're uniquely positioned to be able to deliver a common data environment.  We take a view that with as much as we do in construction, engineering and construction, we think we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry. The reality is we don't do everything nor do our competitors or our peers. So our mindset is that of an open system being able to bring data from disparate sources together. And we're informed by that through our own set of technology that we have that can serve the architects through the engineers, through the contractors, through the owners. Customers are putting digitization at the top of their agenda. They're putting sustainability at the top of their agenda. At the moment, inflation is, I'd say, a major concern as is labor availability for these large customers and these large projects. So now if I put that into context of the second part of your question around M&A and where might the markets go over time, well, I would expect construction tech has been a rather active field over the last few years. And with the money going into infrastructure, I would expect to see continued investment into the space. I would suspect all of us -- the bigger companies in the industry will probably be reasonably acquisitive. Then I think you have to put that again in context of the companies that are out there. I think there's a lot of businesses out there that in reality are probably features rather than businesses that are better fit for Trimble of peers of Trimble. There's not a lot of scaled technology companies in this industry. If we look at the combined size of our buildings and infrastructure and really the relevant parts of our Geospatial business, I would submit that we're one of the largest, if not the largest construction technology companies in the world.
Rob Wertheimer: And since you touched on inflation, are you seeing any impact on project pacing or delays or cancellations from that inflation, or is it just something people are evaluating? I guess I'll stop there, Rob.
Rob Painter: I would say we are seeing a few delays and some -- not so much cancellations but more delays. And I'll be U.S.-centric when I say this, because we do see the cost of the raw materials having gone up significantly. So now there is more money that is starting to -- it looks like to flow out of the infrastructure bill. At the moment, a good amount of that is getting chewed up through inflation. And so we've seen the money as it's being has a longer delay or a longer lag to put in place construction than we've seen in the past. And we think it's -- I'd say some of the -- and I take a DOT, Department of Transportation, stepping back a bit and doing some reassessment, more working trying to figure out how to work through it. Now put that inflation into its own context of the value proposition of Trimble, which is better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener, we are getting these project owners to pay attention to the value of technology. So I'm encouraged by that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein.
Chad Dillard: So I wanted to spend a little bit of time on your comments about Trimble Construction One and plan to roll it out into your broader construction portfolio. So how much of that portfolio do you plan to scale within Trimble Construction One? And then can you just talk about the road map? So I mean how many years are you planning to take to get that to scale? And just what sort of investment do you need to make to get there?
Rob Painter: Yes. So I'll give you, I'll say, a part of an answer now, and then I think this will be a good topic for us to have time to go into more detail in our Investor Day in early September. Chad, from a Trimble Construction One perspective, if you ask me -- if you're asking me what -- how much of the portfolio of, I'll say, both of the buildings as an infrastructure segment, I would see it applying to my goal is 100%, okay, maybe in reality, it's something a bit less than that. But in terms of ambition level, I think that's what you want to understand is that we rarely see that almost everything in and the business could apply in this mindset, in this approach to how we go to market. The part that would be back off of saying 100% is, hey, we have some small customers take some architects, for example, that we'll only want to buy our SketchUp product. And they can just buy our SketchUp product. We're not going to make them buy everything in order to use SketchUp. So wherever it can apply to customer sense. Our goal is to do that, both in the building construction side as well as the civil construction side of the business. And then in terms of the rollout, I talked about in the prepared remarks, the rollout to different personas, and we started with the contractor persona and construction.  As we come into, say, the first half of next year, I'd say the end of this year and in the first half of next year, we'll start to see those additional personas roll out. And then the thing that goes along parallel with that work of the -- I'll say the product roll out to persona is the underlying digital systems transformation work that we're that we're doing. And that really is an enabler. These are very much linked. So when we talk about the increases in investments we're making into our digital transformation and that run rate has been -- is over, I'd say, over $20 million incremental a year, that is very much associated with driving Trimble Construction One and with our recurring revenue business across all of Trimble. So we're talking about TC1 as the Construction One, but we will have this approach in transportation and agriculture. To really efficiently and effectively scale the work, we need these underlying systems projects to come along. So I talked about that in the prepared remarks that I think we're making nice progress on the early releases. We've got a second release -- but hey, it's only in France and Benelux right now. We'll get to North America in the first half of next year, and of course, North America is where we have the largest amount of revenue. So there, we expect to really my hope and our plan is that we see acceleration in the business as we can be more efficient and effective and actually delivering Trimble Construction One. So I hope that gives you a little perspective, Chad. How many years? I think we're on a -- we're certainly on a multiyear journey. In fact, I talked about rolling out to different businesses within trial different industries within Trimble. Right now, we're also focused on the direct side of our business. We also have about half of Trimble that transacts through partner channels, they're indirect channels, and will be doing partner enablement on the systems work as well over time.
Chad Dillard: And then just my second question, as we stress test the Trimble model for recessionary scenarios, can you just talk about the ebb and flow of recurring revenues, your software revenues in that sort of environment? And how we should think about that going forward?
Rob Painter: Yes, the best data I can give you on that, Chad, will be on Page 3 of the presentation that went along with the script. And so when I look at that and we were thinking about the call, we thought it would be constructive to look at the percent of software in Trimble compared to 10 years ago, the amount of recurring revenue or ARR that we have compared to 10 years ago, as well as the margin and cash flow expansion over that time frame. We were a company that had $361 million of ARR 10 years ago. We stand this quarter at $1.51 billion in ARR. $1.51 billion in ARR, there's not a lot of companies that have that amount of ARR. That's continued to grow over a longitudinal basis has grown 15%. We grew 15% ARR in the quarter, we took the guide up to 16% for the year on the ARR. We believe it's the most resilient of the revenue streams that we have, which is quite logical compared to, let's say, the hardware businesses, which, let's say, in normal times because right now, we do have a backlog in hardware and normal times look something more like a book and burn business. So there is a cyclical undertone to the secular thesis on the hardware business. But this is a major shift we've had in our business over the last few years. And when we've also done the stress test, looking back, you could go back to 2001, we have looked at the financial crisis in the 2008, 2009 time frame. We looked at commodity crash in the '14, '15 time frame as well as early COVID and we stress tested. We could go back and see how we stress tested on variability in the different end markets, as well as revenue streams. And that all informs the point of view we put forward on that ARR and the software side of the revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Rob, I'm wondering if we could just pick up that discussion. So it's interesting because your guidance essentially has you exiting ARR organic growth at about 17%, entering the year at 14%. Can you just talk about what's driving the acceleration? And do you see that acceleration continuing into early '23? I know you folks have a pipeline measurement mechanism that gives you pretty good visibility. I'm wondering if you could just touch on what that pipeline looks like as we exit this year?
Rob Painter: Yes. The drivers of the ARR growth are going to be bookings and net retention is the 2 major I'd say, aspects of the ARR growth. So you're right, Jerry, that yes, by the math, we would see -- expect to see a tick-up at the, let's say, in the fourth -- by the fourth quarter in the ARR growth -- in the growth, excuse me, of ARR. Our net retention is running, I'd say, well over 100% across the Trimble businesses. And then the underlying bookings. Bookings have been, I'd say, solid to quite good in the first half of the year, both if we look at before pricing and after pricing view on that. So I think it's one thing that's probably important to communicate is our growth is not just coming from pricing on a, I'll say, a common unit count. So we are actually driving penetration into the business, really both software and hardware as well when I say that. Okay, so as it relates to coming into 2023 and a view on ARR growth, I would be -- I'd hold off on, I'd say, commenting on a specificity for 2023 view on ARR growth, but what I can say is that we would expect to -- just to your point, Jerry, in terms of the visibility in the pipeline and the math is we see double-digit growth next year in that ARR. And I think that's the best way I could answer it at this point.
Jerry Revich: And then just to shift gears a little bit here. Can you just update us on your plans for subscription transitioning from perpetual license as you folks are moving towards the platforms that you spoke to, Rob, in the prepared remarks? Can you just update us on the size of the businesses that you should be looking for to transitioning to subscription from perpetual license given the platform approach?
Rob Painter: Yes, good question, Jerry. So if we look at a TTM revenue on Trimble at the moment, we've got over $450 million in perpetual licenses at the moment. Now if we then we break that $450 million down, the majority of that is associated with the hardware that we sell. So if you're buying let's say, some of the guidance or some of the GNSS receivers, Increasingly, we sell software unlocks to increase capability within the solution.  And then from a -- I'll call it, a straight-up perpetual software stand-alone set of revenue, that's actually quite, is becoming quite small today. And that, I'd say, is kudos to our teams having gone through a lot of the transitions, most recently in the Tekla Structures business has been one of the ones that's done the conversion over the last 12 months, which is part of what's throttled some of the revenue, top line revenue this year, but also been part of the acceleration of the overall ARR from that team. What I'd also want to say, Jerry, is when we look at the software that is associated with that hardware, it is our intention in, I'd say, the near to midterm to move more of that to a recurring basis because we do think that we can continue to provide value to our customers through this firmware, the software over-the-air updates, what you see in some other industries like automotive, for example. So I'd say watch out for that over time and for us to update as we move further along with that. And then, hey, we've also talked a little bit about on our hardware businesses where we want to move more of those towards a subscription offering as we can provide technology assurance to our customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.
Kristen Owen: I wanted to actually piggyback on that last question and ask specifically about the recurring rates that you noted in Geospatial. I'm wondering is that coming on top of hardware sales? Can you talk about maybe what attach rates look like? And I'm just thinking about what the total addressable market could be for your recurring revenue streams in Geospatial just given the breadth of the hardware that you have in place.
Rob Painter: So Geospatial is the most hardware-centric of the businesses have. And we -- therefore, it has the least amount of software, least amount of recurring revenue on an absolute dollar level. What the team has done is they have moved more of the -- some more of the software revenue that is in the business to recurring. So I'd say on a percentage basis, the ARR is growing nicely in Geospatial as it's growing off a smaller base and earlier in the transition. So there's a little bit of the percentages. If I'm only looking at that segment, that as a result of that math. That dilutes at the total company level. So it's really the other businesses that are driving the total company ARR dollars forward. But you asked a good question, which is, okay, given the amount of hardware that we have in that business, could that look more software-centric in the future and have more unlocks? And I'd say definitively, yes. One example is we have we call it a soft GNSS product, it's called Trimble Catalyst and it think of it as positioning-as-a-service. It's probably the best way to describe it. And we're seeing some really interesting levels of adoption of this positioning-as-a-service. And some applications that we wouldn't have expected to see before. In some cases, it's some traditional markets like GIS market, where it's taking up. We also have seen, giving you just a couple of examples, I wouldn't say this is across the business. But we've got a customer in the state of Florida where we did a competitive switch, and we move that customer entirely to an as-a-service basis everything, the hardware and the software, everything. Think of it as like a white glove service to that customer. So I do think that there's opportunity for the team to do that. And actually, one of the things that I think is really interesting that the team -- and very good that the team is doing, as we're consolidating the number of, I'll say, software products we have. So we're going from many and to really just a couple. And we're taking a mindset of microservices, architecture mindset. So capabilities such as photogrammetry or image recognition, we take as a micro service that's sold on our Trimble Business Center software platform within Geospatial. And so I think that does make for some interesting upsell and recurring revenue opportunities over time. Now besides the addressable market, I think, Kristen, will be lower than what we have in our other markets just by nature of the -- still of the underlying fundamental solution.
Kristen Owen: So then just thinking about what the business models look like and maybe using Construction One as the first iteration of this, I mean, are you thinking that Construction One ultimately looks like a typical subscription model? Or should we be thinking about this as moving towards something that's more consumption based, like where you could flex up and down based on your needs, just thinking about the different models that you could approach with that platform?
Rob Painter: Yes, it's a terrific question, Kristen. In the short term, it will look more like a typical subscription model. But I will say we have a couple of the businesses that really are more on a consumption basis today. It could be consumption on a seasonal basis, let's say, on a farm cycle basis. It's in our Tekla Structures business. We have customers who will buy for the duration of a project. So that is something closer to consumption.  I think if we were to fast forward, I don't know, I'll pick a number, 10 years. I think what comes after the typical subscription model does start to look like consumption in the -- on a longitudinal basis. And at that point, then you have to ask, are you really -- should you be talking about recurring revenue at that point, or is it total revenue to the metric shift over time. So we'll have a little bit of that consumption. But the vast majority in the next few years will look like a typical subscription model.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to maybe start out with your thoughts around the pricing actions that you're taking. Is there a way you can provide us with a little bit of color in terms of the absolute levels, as well as realization, just given some of the inflationary pressure and FX pressures that your customers are facing?
Rob Painter: Jonathan, so 50/50 is the answer. We think it's 50% price, 50%, I'll say, underlying unit volume. We think that weighted a bit higher on pricing, probably in the first half of the year, and we'll wait a little bit more on the unit volume in the second half of the year. There's some differences in the different businesses, ag, construction and whatnot. But there's a bit of a false precision that you can have here in trying to totally quantify this, but that's the best direction I can give you, is about half and half.
Jonathan Ho: And then just in terms of your comments about being much more secular play than cyclical, can you talk a little bit about some of these conversations that you had with large customers and their prioritization of Trimble over maybe more traditional cyclical acquisitions? And Yes, I guess what are you hearing from customers when it comes to preserving their budget spend with Trimble?
Rob Painter: So one of the things we hear from customers relative to the business model. I mean is when you have the -- when you move from CapEx to OpEx, there are a set of customers that you can reach that you weren't previously reaching. So one of the things we've seen when we transition the model in our SketchUp product, and I'll say a shout-out to that team, they're in 11 quarters in a row of over 45% year-over-year ARR growth. far exceeding what I thought was possible. They've done a terrific job. And our Tekla Structures business, that's moved to subscription. We're seeing that we're getting customers that we weren't before. So it is, I'd say, increasing the size of the addressable market. That's a very attractive thing. Okay, so at the largest companies, that's not -- we were already working with many of these companies. What they -- one of the things they like about is the ability to attach the cost of the technology to the specific jobs. So the billing out of technology. So there are some customers who are attracted to that for that reason. Some customers like the ability if they can flex licenses up or down depending on -- because we're moving more and more to named user licenses. If they can flex up or down, that provides value to our customers, and that will be something that -- and that is something that's on the top of their mind. One of the things in addition we see is we move Trimble Construction One. let's say let's talk about the frame agreement part of this is our customers of these big customers, and I met with in Europe were looking to have just one set of terms and conditions and one contract, one frame agreement for them to be able to buy Trimble. And we see some customers, not all, but some customers of the big customers looking to essentially act more like one company and really challenge some of the old paradigms of where technology decisions are made on the individual projects versus trying to drive, I'll say, more corporate efficiency and effectiveness. And so as we move -- for them, as we move the subscription offering, it makes it easier for them to consume a larger amount of Trimble technology. So I felt quite validated with the customers I've met with over the last weeks that this is very much the direction they want us to go.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JP Morgan.
Tami Zakaria: So I wanted to understand your organic growth guide a little better. I think you lowered your guide by about 1% which seems relatively modest when contrasting that to your comment about moderation in several end markets. So can you help us bridge the 2? Is it that your backlog is supporting your growth outlook this year, but you're seeing new order growth that is expected to be delivered after this fiscal, you're seeing more of a sizable slowdown?
Rob Painter: I'll start, and David, if I leave something out, you can jump in on this. A couple of dynamics on that inflection. If I look back to 3 months ago, we had come out of the first quarter, well, quite strong out of the first quarter. And if I take a market like European -- agriculture in Europe that had done quite well at the beginning of the year, that was the same time that we made the decision to exit Russia business. The Ukraine business is effectively shut down at the moment given the war. Between the 2, that's $65 million of revenue. It was my belief that at the 3 months ago that the market was so strong that it could absorb that $65 million, and I was looking at the backlog. I'd say, 3 months later, I was a little too optimistic on that. And if I look at the ag business for the second -- well, actually up level to the segment, the Resources and Utilities segment, we still expect double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. And I really don't want that point to be lost through my commentary. So we're maintaining a view of double-digit organic growth in agriculture. And to me, the delta from the commentary a few months ago was -- one of the deltas is that I see less ability for that Russia business to just get absorbed into the system. And which I should also say, the majority of our Russia and Ukraine business was agriculture, a strong majority of it. Now connect to the other part of your question on the backlog, we still are running backlog that's, I'd say, a good $140 million ahead of where we would typically see backlog if we're looking back on a longitudinal basis. I think we'll end the year with a higher level of backlog than we expected 3 months ago, different by some of the different businesses in Trimble, and that connects to the commentary around supply chain. David, did I leave anything out?
David Barnes: No, I’ll just sort of what you said in numbers, Rob, that if you look at the midpoint of the revenue guide down $50 million, half of that’s currency, as Rob said. The rest is the mix of demand and supply. There’s actually in a context of an improving supply chain overall. There are some new component supply issues that we actually didn’t anticipate a quarter ago that will pinch our resource business and Geospatial. So as Rob said, that will -- that demand is not expiring. We’re just going to end up for those products with a little more backlog than we expected. And then there’s some residual demand. The ag business in Europe has been really tough. So all the reasons Rob mentioned. There’s not only high inflation, but they’ve had epic heat with lack of productivity. There are issues with constrained availability of fuel. So the sentiment in the ag business globally is definitely less was a quarter ago, and we see it more in Europe. But the demand part of the guide adjustment is quite small.
Tami Zakaria: And quickly, can you remind us your exposure to the residential market across the 4 segments, and whether you’re seeing any slowdown in the revenue end markets?
Rob Painter: Okay, transportation, no exposure; agriculture -- resources and utilities excuse me, no exposure. In the geospatial and the B&I businesses are kind of up-level those, engineering and construction. I said, yes, we do have exposure to residential. It’s not kind of an existential exposure. And what I’d want to say is while residential inflected, let’s say, negative or worse over the last couple of months on an absolute basis, it’s still a very high number. And so we haven’t seen any meaningful inflections down in our business -- in our business, from residential at this point. We haven’t. And I’ll give you an example in the civil construction business. Over the last number of years, we moved towards putting more and more of the technology on excavators, it’s the largest machine count in the world, the lowest level of penetration. That has translated over the last couple of years into more work being done on the bigger residential developments. Just on 1 single-family house, okay, you’re not going to -- I don’t think you’re going to use -- my guess is you're going to --not many people are using the technology yet, but you take the larger developments, and they are starting to use technology for site preparation. In the vertical construction side of our business, I’d say it’s a minor level of exposure that we have. I mean the geospatial business, a survey or most surveyors do multiple types of work. So there -- I wouldn’t say there’s many that only do 1 type of work like they only do residential. I’m not aware of surveyors who would, or at least many surveyors who would only do that. An anecdote, I was talking to one of our dealer partners in Florida, he told me that they were seeing residential go down in Florida. But at the same time, the entertainment business, the theme park work, was going way up and completely offsetting what they were seeing as a down on residential. So the work does move around. We clearly need to pay attention to it, both in Europe, as well as here in the States and then pay attention regionally as well as we’ve seen the movements on residential work. But our contractors are busy. They’ve got the backlog, they’re working through it. So to me, it’s going to be a question of what happens to the size of the backlog in these different end markets that are served. We obviously -- you know we think about residential. We think more about infrastructure, we think about commercial work, we think about segments such as EPC and follow the trends in all of these.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Lapinski with Morgan Stanley.
Erik Lapinski: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe if I could ask you a question just on the transportation business since. We didn't touch too much on that. It looks like the performance for the subscription businesses is definitely improving, but you did not reduce hardware sales in North America. I guess I was just wondering, is that related to any mix within the portfolio of just where you're seeing traction with solutions or improvement? And then you have talked about selling some of that hardware as part of a bundle in the past. Just wondering if that has any factor too.
Rob Painter: So the hardware sales yes, this is hardware primarily it's associated with essentially telematics subscription. We call it our mobility business. So you buy an onboard computer that's enabling technology for the I'll call it the long tail subscription, and we sell on a per truck basis. We felt -- we have an OEM business as well as an aftermarket business. We are primarily an aftermarket business. One of the inflections down we saw in the hardware business was one of our OEM partners taking less volume in the quarter than we anticipated. And that's been fluctuating up and down because as we know, both ourselves, but in this case, an OEM partner, they've got their own supply chain fluctuations independent of Trimble. So that was one inflection on the hardware for the quarter. And then in the aftermarket, I'd say that was lower than we had anticipated as well.  We have launched an updated I'd say, offering. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. And we've got our biggest user conference in about 1.5 weeks that starts, which is our, I'd say, our best venue to roll out what we're doing in that business. So I'd say we're maybe a couple of months -- a few months behind where I thought we might be at this point and driving new business. But we are seeing the pipeline pick up around it. And then you noted the important point, which to me is the thing I didn't want to be lost in the commentary is that of ARR and the sequential growth in the ARR, and it's -- growth in ARR and sequential growth and if you look at the growth from the first quarter and then the growth into the second quarter on the ARR, that to me is the most attractive revenue stream. Well, it's the most attractive revenue stream we have in Trimble. It's the most attractive stream therefore within Transportation. And like that's where we've got to keep our eye on as continuing to drive that ARR forward in the business. So eyes are very much on that, both at the discrete product selling level, in this case, let's say, a telematics subscription, but also form of that Trimble Construction One for our transportation customers for them to be able to buy multiple solutions. So even in absence of having a frame around it, I'd say, it's well positioned as Trimble Construction One is at the moment. It's not like you have to wait to go and sell, “the house and transportation.” So we've got customers today who will buy our enterprise ERP solutions plus our mobility solutions plus video plus our final mile solutions plus our mapping solutions plus our maintenance solutions. So we have customers who are buying all of that today from us. And like our other businesses, we think that there's an attractive opportunity to upsell and cross-sell within the base.  We'll talk a little bit more about it at Investor Day, but more than 90% of the top 200 trucking companies in North America are Trimble customers, today Trimble Transportation customers, and the majority of those -- very, very strong majority of those are not buying everything they could be buying from us. So we need to continue to work at the go-to-market and product level to get the, I'll say, deliver the most customer value so that we can increase the level of penetration into that market segment.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Rob Painter : Thank you all. Thank you for attending the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Trimble will be having an Investor Day on September 7, and hope you can make it. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Trimble First Quarter 2022 Results. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Robert Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Let's begin on Page 2, with gratitude and a shout-out to our team and our partners for delivering a record first quarter that exceeded our expectations. The team delivered record levels of annualized recurring revenue of $1.47 billion, revenue of $994 million and EBITDA of $253 million. Every reporting segment met or exceeded expectations and backlog stands at $1.7 billion.  Our software teams exceeded expectations on delivering ARR growth as we continue to transform our business models. And we achieved record levels of recurring software bookings in many parts of the business. On the hardware side, our operations team secured components late in the quarter to solidify our strong performance.  [Indiscernible] speaking, the story of the first quarter is that demand remains healthy, our strategy is working, and we continue to execute in a very dynamic environment.  Against this backdrop, we are raising our organic annual guidance for the year, adjusting for the impact of divestitures and currency. As many of you know, we think on a 3-4-3 operating cadence, simultaneously balancing 3 months, 4 quarters and 3 years. We aim for the same balance on these update calls. I'll start my commentary by addressing some of the specific topics you've been asking about in the 3-4 zone, namely Russia and Ukraine, supply chain, inflation and market conditions.  Starting with Russia and Ukraine. Our first priority remains the safety of our teams. For the business, we continue to pause all new sales into Russia and Belarus and our long-term planning assumption is that our 2% of revenue from the region does not come back, most of which comes from agriculture and survey hardware. Given our current backlog, we are directing as much product elsewhere as possible, and we do not anticipate a material change to 2022 company revenue.  In Ukraine, we are highly motivated to help however we can, but the practicalities on the ground are obviously very difficult. We have donated to relief efforts through our foundation and have begun preparations for how we can help with rebuild efforts.  As it relates to supply chain, the short answer is that it isn't getting easier, but we also [Technical Difficulty]. We are a purpose-driven company with a mission to transform the way the world works. On March 31, we announced a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that links 2 of our sustainability commitments, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing gender diversity at Trimble. While we continue to await approval of our science-based targets, we also added ESG performance metrics to long-term incentive compensation for our named executive officers. Talk is cheap. We are taking action.  Consistent with our 3-4-3 model, I'll talk next about capital allocation and how we view ourselves as capital allocators on behalf of our shareholders. I believe how we allocate our resources, time, people and money, and how we balance that across short- and long-term horizons will ultimately determine how we are judged as operators.  In the first quarter, we executed $105 million of share buybacks. In the quarter, we put our balance sheet to work to build inventory where possible. The biggest news, though, is that we announced the sale of 5 of our businesses in the last few weeks, our precision tools business, our weighing business, our timing business, our accessories business and one of our rail businesses. This is in addition to 7 businesses we divested over the previous 2 years.  We continue to focus our efforts on developing and growing our connected industry platforms in building our digital transformation capabilities. We believe the best ongoing fit for these businesses lies outside Trimble, yet I would be remiss not to step back and acknowledge that these are our long-term colleagues and the results they delivered over the years enabled much of the transformation you see in us today. My gratitude to all these colleagues and to all of our colleagues who worked tirelessly on this effort over the last few quarters. David will walk you through the numbers in his remarks.  Moving to Page 3. Let's talk about innovation and our platform strategy. We are building industry clouds to connect stakeholders and workflows across operational life cycles. In Construction, for example, we aim to connect the complete project life cycle to automate and optimize work, establishing shared industry protocols and common data environments so that diverse stakeholders can efficiently collaborate and work across the design, build, operate stages of project delivery.  Our strategy is already delivering innovative value today based on a strong foundation of technologies in areas such as positioning and sensing, mixed reality, robotics, autonomy, data science and artificial intelligence. Through our partnership with Microsoft, we are enabling designers, engineers and contractors to collaborate with one another by interacting with richer data and more immersive models. And Trimble is the only company in the world with direct access to Microsoft's HoloLens technology that we have integrated directly into our Trimble XR10. Through our partnership with Boston Dynamics, we are at the intersection of the physical and digital world in robotics, where builders use our automated scanning solutions to capture as-built throughout the asset operational life cycle.  Through our machine control and guidance technologies, we have been working on autonomy for over 20 years. We are innovating through progressive stages of autonomy with the most recent addition of horizontal steering controls for dozers and compactors, which deliver productivity and sustainability. Our strategy also leverages Trimble product innovation into differentiated go-to-market motions. We are evolving and enhancing our commerce model to remove friction, enhance the user experience, and enable value to be captured and exchanged through more granular interactions at the point of work.  Value is increasingly tied to subscription payments and delivered on an API-driven services platform so that producers and operators can self-provision services and get real-time user feedback. As an example, our Trimble Construction One solution, as shown on Page 4, delivers a unified provisioning experience across more than 20 products and services and enables our divisions to sell persona-based bundles and discrete connected workflows. We are aggressively streamlining online experiences via self-provision subscription services that empower users to thrive and unlock new innovations for modern ecosystems and project stakeholders.  This improves real-time collaboration and interactions at scale that help us address society's most urgent challenges. To enable this strategy, we are investing heavily in our underlying digital systems. Our initial pilots are already demonstrating value by improving the productivity of our sales teams as they serve common customers. As we continue to roll out functionality in the quarters ahead, we expect to be able to deliver our commercial offerings at increasing levels of scale while generating new and impactful digital insights about our customers' journey.  I will close with a comment on our planned Investor Day in September. The 3 questions we hear most on investors' minds includes: one, the arc of our model progression; two, progress and proof points of our industry platform strategy; and three, the collective impact of the current market risks, namely recession, war, inflation and supply chain. Your feedback over the coming months will be appreciated as we prepare for this update. David?
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue of $994 million was up 14% organically year-on-year. Changes in foreign exchange rates subtracted 2% to revenue growth, resulting in reported growth of 12%. The strong revenue performance was broad-based. Approximately 2/3 of our 14% organic revenue growth came from volume, with the remaining 1/3 driven by the impact of price increases we have taken in the past year. Software and recurring revenue increased as expected, and hardware revenue was better than expectations, driven by the success of our operations team and getting more product through our supply chain.  Gross margin in the first quarter was 57.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, partially offset by increased pricing and improved software margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.5%, down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by lower gross margins and, to a lesser extent, higher operating expenses from our strategic investments and a return to normalized expense levels.  Operating margin was 23.5%, down 10 basis points year-over-year. Net income dollars increased by 11%, and earnings per share increased by $0.07 to $0.73 per share. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $153 million and free cash flow was $139 million. Cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continue to build inventory and as a result of our incentive plan payouts following very strong performance versus our 2021 objectives. Deferred revenue grew 14%, reflecting continued strong growth in recurring revenue streams.  The underlying working capital dynamics in our business remains strong, and we expect that our net working capital will remain near 0 as the year progresses even in this difficult supply chain environment. Our net debt declined over $30 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remains around 1.0.  Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. ARR was up 12% in aggregate and up 14% organically. Our nonrecurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 11% year-over-year and perpetual software growing 8%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with software. From a geographic perspective, North America revenues were up 11%. In Europe, revenues were up 14%. Asia Pacific was up 5% year-over-year, and the rest of the world was up 31%. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Organic ARR in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities all grew in the teens or above, while transportation ARR growth was in the mid-single digits and improved sequentially. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, continued to be negative despite the build in inventory during the first quarter. Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 14.5% of revenue, with approximately 2/3 of our R&D investments going into software development. Of our $1.7 billion in backlog, approximately $345 million represents hardware backlog, down modestly from year-end 2021 levels but still well above our historical norms. Supply chain constraints continue to be very dynamic in nature, but our team made good progress in the quarter working around constraints and executing well in a challenging environment.  Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 18% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses, and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. Geospatial revenue was up 16% on an organic basis driven by strong performance in our survey and mapping business. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 16% on an organic basis driven by continued strength in agriculture in Europe, South America and the United States. Financial results in transportation showed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 2% on an organic basis year-over-year, and organic ARR growth improved for the third quarter in a row.  We continue to progress on the conversion of our transportation enterprise software business to recurring revenue models and made good progress on development of a new product in our mobility business, which we believe will improve both margins and competitiveness when it is launched later this year. We continue to project improved momentum in margins and ARR growth in our Transportation segment in the fourth quarter.  Turning now to Slide 9. I'd like to provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. As Rob highlighted earlier, demand remains broadly strong across the end markets we serve. High inflation, rising interest rates and the impact of the war in Ukraine are, of course, impacting sentiment around the world, but we don't see meaningful signs that these developments are reducing current demand for our offerings. Our backlog of $1.7 billion, which reflects historically high levels of hardware backlog and growth in our recurring revenue offerings, gives us significant visibility through the balance of 2022. We continue to expect supply chain challenges into 2023, although we are increasingly optimistic that we will see component availability improve in the second half of this year.  With that backdrop, I'll talk through our updated guidance. Our recently announced divestitures and the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar will both impact our financial results for the balance of 2022, so I'll focus first on organic trends. The key message here is that our organic outlook for ARR, revenue and earnings have all improved. We are raising the midpoint of our organic revenue guidance by $30 million with an updated range of $3.99 billion to $4.07 billion. That revised view reflects an organic outlook for revenue growth of 10% to 12%.  The midpoint of our organic EPS forecast has increased by $0.06 with a new EPS range of $2.85 to $3. We are raising our outlook for organic ARR growth to above 15%. Our full year outlook reflects our expectation that organic revenue growth will be in the mid-teens in our Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utility segments where demand remains very strong and backlog is high. Geospatial organic growth is expected to moderate from the first quarter pace and be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the year against 27% growth in 2021. We expect that our Transportation segment will see low single-digit organic growth for the year with meaningful improvement by the fourth quarter when our initiatives to improve retention and grow ARR take hold.  The table on Page 9 of our presentation bridges this organic outlook through the impacts of the changes in exchange rates and our upcoming divestitures. The U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly versus the euro and other major currencies in the last 90 days. Assuming that exchange rates remain where they are now, we estimate the impact on our revenue from our last outlook of approximately $45 million. We expect that the divestitures will close in the second quarter and will reduce our 2022 revenues by approximately $145 million. 60% of the revenue impact is in Buildings and Infrastructure, 30% in Geospatial, and 10% in transportation.  As a result, our updated full year revenue guidance incorporating the impact of divestitures and recent changes in exchange rates is $3.80 billion to $3.88 billion. We now expect gross margins to be up approximately 100 basis points for the full year with the majority of that improvement coming in the second half. This reflects our view that the pricing actions we are taking will more than offset inflation in the second half.  Our outlook for full year operating margins has increased to a range of 23% to 23.5%. Embedded in this outlook is the assumption that operating margins will be adversely impacted by our ongoing subscription transitions as well as the investments we are making in support of our Connect and Scale strategy and the acceleration of ARR. In aggregate, these factors present a headwind to operating margins of approximately 200 basis points for the year.  Our outlook for the margin impact of subscription transitions and strategic investments is unchanged from what we presented a quarter ago. The divestitures will reduce full year EPS by approximately $0.11 and recent changes in foreign exchange rates will impact our earnings per share outlook by about $0.03, resulting in a revised full year EPS range of $2.71 to $2.86. Hardware makes up the substantial majority of the revenue of the divested businesses, and as a result, the divestitures will not have a meaningful impact on ARR trends.  Looking to 2023 and beyond, we expect that the divestitures will be accretive to both revenue growth and operating margins. More strategically, our business post divestitures will be more centered on our platform strategy and our mix of ARR and software will be higher. Forecast for income from equity investments and net interest cost is unchanged. Our tax rate guidance has increased to a range of 18.5% to 19%.  From a cash flow perspective, we project that free cash flow will be approximately equal to our non-GAAP net income with stronger performance in the second half of the year. This forecast reflects our view that our inventory levels will grow modestly and that the U.S. Congress will take action to permit the continued upfront deduction of R&D expenses. If the legislation is not passed and R&D costs are capitalized for tax purposes, then our 2022 cash flow outlook will be adversely impacted by approximately $70 million. Note that the tax capitalization of R&D cost has no meaningful impact on our book tax rates, only the timing of cash payments.  A few words on the quarterly dynamics we expect for the balance of this year. The supply chain issues have disrupted the normal seasonal patterns in our business. While the second quarter would normally be our largest quarter in absolute revenue, that is not what we expect this year. After the impact of divestitures and recent currency movements, we expect second quarter revenue to be down slightly versus the second quarter of 2021, which was unusually strong. Following the second quarter, we expect revenue to increase sequentially through the third and fourth quarters, reflecting gradual normalization in the supply chain, higher prices and increasing software and recurring growth.  From a gross margin perspective, we expect second quarter gross margins to be consistent with the first quarter and then the increase in the second half of the year as our additional pricing actions take effect. Driven by improved price realization and revenue mix, we expect gross margins will be approximately 250 basis points higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and operating margins will be approximately 200 basis points higher in the second half of 2022 versus the first half. We forecast second quarter earnings per share to be below second quarter 2021 earnings per share with double-digit year-on-year EPS growth in the back half of the year even after the impact of the divestitures. Most importantly, we have increased confidence in the drivers of our organic ARR progression for the remainder of the year.  Rob, back to you.
Robert Painter: Belong, grow, innovate. These are the 3 core Trimble values. Against a challenging landscape in the context of ongoing change, I am proud of what my colleagues have accomplished, individually and collectively. I'm gratified to see that we have been named a top company culture and a top workplace for innovators. We are driven by a sense of purpose at Trimble, and we are proving that we can deliver financial results while showing up with compassion for our colleagues and our communities.  The level of curiosity and openness to growth I see displayed at Trimble gives me confidence that we can continue to execute our strategy.  Operator, let's open the line to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could just talk about the divestiture package. What are the anticipated proceeds gains and use of proceeds? I see you folks bought back more stock in the quarter. Is that the primary capital deployment plan from a short-term standpoint once the divestitures are finalized?
David Barnes: Jerry, the divestitures haven't closed. We expect them to close in the second quarter. The proceeds will be a little over $200 million. I see that cash flow flowing into our overall capital allocation priorities. We are fortunate to have powder dry to do deals that will complement our strategy and growth. So that's the first priority. We are repurchasing shares. You probably saw, we did a little over $100 million in the first quarter. Our thinking is that we will continue to at least offset the dilution from stock comp and probably go a little higher given our current leverage position. But the overall priority is -- has not changed that our first focus on allocation of capital is to grow the business.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then in terms of the second quarter guidance, looking at the high end of the potential revenue outlook year-over-year implies sequentially sales performance that's worse than normal seasonality by a few points. So I'm wondering, can you just expand on that? So I get the tough comps year-over-year, but sequentially, we have ARR growing. We have sequentially deliveries of hardware that should be up. So I'm wondering if you can just expand, David, on where you actually see the supply chain disruptions and what's driving that sequential outlook and I get the year-over-year comps?
David Barnes: Yes. So the first and pretty obvious point is the impact of the divestitures and foreign exchange, which have a pretty meaningful impact year-on-year and sequentially. I think you're right to focus on ARR growth because we do see that as a more reliable barometer of the momentum of our business. There are a couple of things that do impact Q2, particularly when you're looking sequentially versus Q1 this year. The two I'd focus you on are, one, the supply chain. We actually had a very, very strong Q2 of last year. We were making a big investment in our U.S. distribution center, which actually caused more shipments to get held up at the end of Q1 of last year and get shipped out in Q2.  We kind of had the opposite phenomenon this year, where we had a very, very strong late quarter Q1 shipment pattern. You saw how strong our hardware shipments. That actually drove our backlog down a little bit, which is a good thing. And we are seeing some latent effects of the shutdowns in China. So there are a couple of factors that make organic growth tough on the hardware side.  With regard to software, the issue is on our term license business, which is a growing part of our recurring revenue stream. A lot of our recurring revenue contracts renew in Q1, The accounting standards have term licenses, all the revenue hits when -- or the majority of the revenue hits when the term begins. And so that really causes sequential trends to look worse than the long-term trends would be, Q1 to Q2.
Operator: Your next question from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital.
Jason Celino: So Rob, you mentioned record software bookings in several parts of the business. I'm curious what areas did you see the strength? And then how much of that is related to maybe internal execution versus the current buying sentiment?
Robert Painter: So the recurring software bookings were pretty spread across the business. So it wasn't concentrated in any particular segment. And I'd say that both at the ARR growth level in the first quarter as well as at the bookings line. From an internal versus external perspective, in the construction side of the business, so that will show up in Buildings and Infrastructure. There, I would attribute some more of the bookings growth to internal execution because that's where we have the initial launches with our new digital tools and the Trimble Construction One offering that we have the slide on. So that is where we could actually see a lift in the bookings, and I would call that internal execution of an offering that's there to meet the market demand for it.  So I'd say most of it is, I would say, external facing and then there's certainly an aspect of internal. And that gives me confidence because we're in early days of our digital systems enabling us to launch these bundled solutions. So I'm bullish on this portfolio.
Jason Celino: Okay. Perfect. That's good color. And then, David, on kind of the second half gross margin improvement, the confidence there. Is this any -- is this in part at all to some of the divestments being maybe lower margin or is it really just purely on the price realization of maybe some of the increases?
David Barnes: Yes. I'll say the -- what we're divesting is hardware businesses, and they are, on average, lower gross margin than the rest. So yes, the divestitures help a little bit. But the much bigger driver is the dynamic of the mix of our business with a greater mix of software, and we'll see the positive impact of the pricing. We actually -- we'll be lapping some of the inflation. And we think we're going to benefit from some normalization of the supply chain. The way I'd characterize that is that we project we will be less reliant on the broker market for key components in the second half of the year than we have been for the last few quarters that will still be with us in Q2.  So we're not in a normal world. We're in an inflationary world, but the -- some of the spikes in input costs will be more manageable and we'll get the full impact of the price increases that we've announced now, which take time to get through the backlog. So those factors, plus the mix, will improve our margins in the second half.
Operator: Our next question from Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan.
Tami Zakaria: So I think last quarter, you highlighted challenges around freight costs and aggressive broker pricing on key components. Have you seen any moderation year-to-date?
David Barnes: I wouldn't say moderation, no. I would say more signs that we've hit the peak and that we don't see acceleration in input costs. And then particularly looking to the second half, Tami, where we expect to see moderation is in our reliance on the broker market, which is where a meaningful part of our cost inflation comes from. So you'll have a part that has a normal standard cost of $1 or $2 or $3 that's available in the broker market for many, many times, 10, in some cases, even 100x the normal cost. So that's been driving a lot of our cost inflation, and we think that impact will be mitigated in the second half.
Tami Zakaria: Understood. And just one quick clarification question. I believe you said you now expect a higher organic revenue growth rate for the year. How much of it is volume versus price driven?
David Barnes: Our -- most of it is volume. Our prices have firmed up a little bit. So we've been -- like a lot of businesses, we've been struggling to estimate how much inflation will be. And so our price outlook is a little better than it was last time, but the bigger driver is that our business is really strong and our ability to execute in the supply chain is a little stronger than we expected last time.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to start with Construction One. How much of a lift does the platform provide relative to your traditional solutions when you think about selling through? And then how does that maybe impact something like net expansion over time?
Robert Painter: Jonathan, it's Rob. So the slide showed Trimble Construction One contractor offering. It's a persona-based offering. What will come next is an architecture and design persona offering and owner persona offering. Within that contractor offering, the early signs we're seeing and we saw it in Q1 play through for us as is we saw really double-digit growth in cross -- what we call cross-sell bookings where we could see the velocity of bookings increased from that offering. We saw our win rates go up significantly. We saw the deal sizes be higher. We saw the sales cycles be lower. And all of that drove bookings up. So Jonathan, for us it's a really good sign that we're on a good path here.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. Got it. And then just given sort of the backlog position that you have, is all of the backlog noncancelable? And are you seeing any evidence of maybe pull forward in demand, just given where lead times are?
Robert Painter: We haven't seen any discernible signs of cancellation in the backlog, Jonathan. So -- and hey, looking from the competitive market standpoint, it's not like there's many places to go. I mean everyone has a supply chain challenge to work through. But I think the real story is it's the efficacy of the value proposition you get from Trimble technology is what's making the backlogs sticky.
Operator: Next question from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Kristen Owen: This is Kristen on for Colin. Wanted to ask about Geospatial, several quarters in a row now of strong growth. You did talk about sort of comps getting tougher in the back half of the year. But that's a segment that just continues to surprise to the upside. I'm wondering if you can provide some additional detail on the drivers there, any sort of specific end markets or applications. And how we should think about sort of attach rates for ARR following those hardware sales?
Robert Painter: It's Rob. So first, I'd shout out to all of our colleagues in Geospatial. They just continued a terrific run in the business. I'll give you a few comments. First, on the innovation side, and this is where the team deserves a lot of credit. So the number of new product introductions has really helped our global distribution channel be able to message out into the market. So whether it's a tilt compensation on our GNSS products. Laser scanner has been doing quite well for us. Mobile mapping business has been doing well, so has monitoring business unit.  At an end market level where we've seen strengths are in Departments of Transportation. So I think infrastructure, think defense actually is also doing reasonably well. The net of all of that is we believe we're gaining market share in the business. And then I'd complement that by also talking about the go-to-market side, and the team has done a really nice job of working with our global dealer channel to drive the business forward.
Kristen Owen: That's really helpful, Rob. And then I wanted to follow up on just sort of a longer-term question. You're tracking well ahead of the 55% software recurring revenue target that you outlined, granted the last Investor Day was a number of years ago, but well ahead of that target even with the outside strength that you've had in hardware in the last several years. So now with the divestitures, that's pointing even higher, what's sort of the right settling point under this new Trimble model? And how should we think about that going forward in terms of your long-term operating margin outlook?
Robert Painter: Well, from a percent of the business, okay, the divestitures alone, you can think of that as 350 plus or minus basis points increase in the mix. In other words, more software mix. The thing that's always difficult with the percentages, Kristen, is if the hardware business continues to do well, and I think it will on the heels of coming infrastructure spend, we would expect that to benefit our hardware businesses, especially in the engineering and construction side of Trimble. So that, by the math, I think that, that would throttle that increased expansion in the percent of software. And ultimately, obviously, we take the dollars to the bank, not the percentages.  If I were to say all things equal, what we've seen over a long baseline now is our recurring revenue is growing faster than our perpetual. It's been growing faster than our hardware. So take that baseline and if we're already in the now post divestiture in the high 50% of that mix, that's naturally moving towards a 60 -- 6 in front of it, so 60-plus percent. When you look at the growth in ARR, David mentioned raising our view on ARR during the year. And so -- and then that's before any, let's say, impact of future acquisitions and how that may further the mix. So 6, in front of it is where it's trending. And as we move towards Investor Day, I think we can sharpen the pencil on that.  Your other question around operating leverage. I mean, certainly, it's our long-term view as you get through model transitions that the nature of the gross margins in the business and a recurring revenue business and software business for that matter are such that we should be able to increase the operating leverage over time. So our historical baseline has been plus or minus 25%, and that looks like something heading towards a 30%, something with a 3 in front of it is where we think about the long-term model, Kristen.
Kristen Owen: Congrats on the nice results.
Operator: Our next question from Rob Mason.
Robert Mason: I wanted to know, Rob or David, in the parts of the business where you have OEM exposure, how was the OEM versus aftermarket growth rate comparing? And specifically, how are you seeing OEM production schedules trend? Are they loosening up? They're under their own production constraints, but are they loosening up? Or just directionally, how that part of the business is trending versus the aftermarket?
Robert Painter: I think there's a little bit of a mixed story on that, Rob. We've certainly seen some areas of the portfolio where production is increasing, and we're seeing our business increase. And then I've seen others where it remains a bit challenged. So I have to say it's a little bit of a mixed view, not a totally consistent view. My read-through of OEM reports this quarter suggests that they're seeing tight supply chains as well for the rest of the year.  And as you know, we primarily orient ourselves around the aftermarket and serving the mixed fleet. And what we're seeing in the aftermarket is continued strong uptake and adoption of the technology, and that really is the growth catalyst for the business.
Robert Mason: Is it fair to say the OEM portions, though, do show growth this year, volume growth?
Robert Painter: Absolutely. Yes, absolutely.
Robert Mason: Okay. And just as a follow-up, as well, Rob, the portfolio has obviously changed over -- certainly in the last 10 years or last time that we entered any type of significant recession and who knows what lies ahead. But can you just discuss some of the businesses that have come into the portfolio since then? And how you might think about, again, I'm thinking about some of the B&I software, in particular, how they have performed historically in periods when it's gotten tougher? Just kind of the durability around the recurring revenue elements there.
Robert Painter: Yes. No, it's a good question. So it may give you a historical comparison on the business mix and why we see our portfolio today being so much more resilient than in the past. And I'll give you a comparison of 2012 to our 2021 numbers. In 2012, the percent recurring revenue we had was about 18%. And in 2021, it was 34% of our business, and that correlates to that $1.47 billion of ARR that we exited Q1 with. Overall, software and services were 32% of our revenue in 2012, 55% at the end of 2021. If we look at the operating income in 2012, 76% of our operating income came from 2 of the segments, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities, and that was 53% in 2021.  So the message is the portfolio has become much more balanced across the end markets that we serve over the last years, much more software-centric, much more recurring within that. So that gives us visibility and predictability into the model looking forward. If I look at the -- you asked about Buildings and Infrastructure in particular, that is a business that's absolutely transformed over the last 10 years. Today, that's approaching 3/4 of our segment and software today in Buildings and Infrastructure, and that would have been almost entirely hardware if you go back to the past.  And then when we've looked at a baseline as well over time of how we've performed in times of recession or difficult economic environments, we only have a small number of years where we've ever actually have seen revenue go down in time. We were, in that first COVID in 2020, we were down about 4% in revenue. We look back to the financial crisis, we look back to 9/11, we look back to the commodity price collapse. There's just 4 years we can look back to where we ever had a revenue decline. And so I mapped that against what today is a much stronger and more resilient business model. And that's what gives us -- it's one of the many things that gives us confidence and conviction to continue to invest in our business.
Operator: Let's proceed to the next question from Chad Dillard from Bernstein.
Chad Dillard: So I was hoping we could dig a little bit more into Viewpoint and e-Builder. Just what has the revenue growth been over this last quarter? What are you seeing in terms of order levels? And how are you thinking about those businesses in terms of 2022?
Robert Painter: ARR growth in the mid- to upper teens in those businesses. The Viewpoint business, I know we had a record first quarter bookings. We look at the intersection of -- actually look at the Viewpoint business specifically, the Trimble Construction One Contractor Cloud, our Viewpoint business is a major component of that offering. And so a good amount of the cross-sell sales that we produced or booked in the first quarter were a result of that part of the portfolio. So we continue to see really good things out of those businesses. We continue to see customers who are asking us to connect the data flows that we have resident in the contractor management system, which is what the Viewpoint business provides to be able to connect that to what's happening in the field, to be able to connect that to subcontractor systems.  What we see on the e-Builder side of the business, which is really serving capital program management for owners of the construction projects. We increasingly have customers who are also using our Cityworks software for enterprise asset management. And now with our recent acquisition of AgileAssets, think about the operational maintenance phase, work and the management of that. We have customers who are asking us to integrate the data and the workflow between these packages. So it really, from my perspective, is confirming that we're on the right path with Connect and Scale and our industry platform strategy.
Chad Dillard: That's helpful. And then just moving over to transportation. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on -- your views on the path to normalization. And maybe you could kind of like break it down to two discussions. One on the volume side, and then two, on we can control more any potential like restructuring the cost base. And ultimately, I guess, kind of do you still think this is a core business?
David Barnes: Chad, it's David. I'll say we did take action this quarter to cut our costs. We've reduced our facility footprint and made a reduction in a piece of the transportation team. As I think about the path forward, I do believe we have strong visibility to the key metrics improving, particularly late this year and the metrics I focus on are our ARR growth and our margins. But if you look at the pieces of the business, we've got a model transformation going on in the enterprise software business. We're seeing good receptivity on our recurring revenue model offerings with customers. We're converting existing customers and winning new logos in that business. So that's a good outlook. It's hard to see it in the revenue line as these transitions always are. But in terms of booking and ARR momentum, we feel really good there.  On the mobility side of the business, the real progress we've made in the last quarter is proving out a new product, which will be released later this year in the second half. We've got that in beta test with a major customer and the outlook is really good. That new product will provide more features, make us much more competitive with some of the competitors who we've lost business to. It will also be better from a margin profile perspective. So the progress we're making there is allowing us to hang on to more of our existing customers, and we believe we've got a really compelling offering for new logos. So we think that will help us in the back half of the year.  We also have a Maps business in our Transportation segment. That is very, very strong. It's growing really well in the United States and in Europe, really posting excellent numbers. So I put all that together, and I know we're in a "show me" mode here. but we think we got a couple of more quarters where we're getting the engine going and then by the fourth quarter. We do believe that we'll have -- we'll be on a path to really demonstrable improvement.  As it relates to your broader question about transportation in our portfolio, if you think about our mission of transforming the way the world works using digital technology and connected platforms to optimize critical workflows, Transportation really fits very well into that theme, and we think we can make this a very good business.
Operator: Our last question is from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.
Erik Lapinski: This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe if we could just -- if you could help us kind of better understand some of the dynamics in Europe. And as we think about the broader Russia-Ukraine impact, it sounded like you're not seeing much sign of disruption there. But I'm wondering as you -- that region maybe is impacted, are you seeing a pickup in other areas to kind of obviously global food needs to be supplied from somewhere. So wondering if you're seeing somewhat of a positive offset within the business from that in other regions?
Robert Painter: It's Rob. Let's just start at Europe. Europe growth in the quarter was 14%. That would have been higher yet, because that haircut's for FX. So in the high teens growth rate. So demonstrable, let's say, evidence that Europe produced in the quarter, and that was reasonably broad-based across all of our segments. Let's talk about Russia and Belarus, Ukraine and the dynamic and I'll focus first really on Russia, Belarus. So yes, at this point, we don't anticipate the revenue coming back. That business is largely agriculture and geospatial oriented. So now let's talk about the agriculture aspect of that business. Yes, the fact of the matter is that 13% of the world's calorie production is now off of the market. The fact of the matter is that with the fertilizer that comes out of that region. And now I'd say the lack of fertilizer are coming out of that region, you would expect to see lower yields around -- of crop around the world.  That does provide the backdrop for what we see in commodity prices. Look at corn around 8, soy over 16. That food is going to be -- need to be produced somewhere. It doesn't happen overnight as we know. There's obviously a growing cycle to that. We would look at market. So I think about Brazil, I think about Canada, I do think about North America, Australia. And as we have a global footprint, we certainly turn our attention -- incrementally turn our attention to those markets.  Now in the short term, the reality is that we have a lot of backlog in our agriculture business. And so in the short term, and I'll define short term as 2022, we don't see a material change to our revenue because we can direct that backlog elsewhere. It's really looking forward after that.  And then if I take Ukraine specifically, we are doing everything we can to help our dealers in the region, it's really inspiring to see a number of our employees and partners continuing to find a way to actually make some of the business go. And so we'll do everything we can to help our customers and partners and the people in that region. And let's hope that, that crop can come back online before too long.
Erik Lapinski: Got it. That's really helpful. And then if we could just go back to the supply chain dynamics. I mean, obviously, you did find better component availability towards the end of the quarter. I'm curious, was that just -- was that you having a willingness to kind of buy on the spot market where available or did you actually see some regular suppliers having better availability of supply, I guess, just trying to understand if it's more spot or kind of normal supply related.
David Barnes: Erik, I'll say it's very unpredictable. Everybody in the supply chain is hand to mouth. The numbers we posted for the first quarter reflect in part the fact that on a number of really constrained key components that were the gateway for us delivering full kit to our dealer customers, a bunch came in. So I think what happened was we're holding nothing back. They're holding nothing back. Just some constraints loosened just in the last few weeks of the quarter. So it's very hard to predict. And frankly, we ended up -- we ended the quarter stronger than we expected to and that was just driven by the availability of some key components we're waiting on. It doesn't reflect really any change in our approach or strategy, it's just the way product flowed in.
Erik Lapinski: Okay. Great. Congrats on a good quarter in a really tough environment.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time today, and we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble. Thank you. Please go ahead sir. 
Rob Painter: Welcome everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Let's begin on Page 2 with the following key messages. Our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so amidst ongoing supply chain difficulties, delivering total organic revenue growth of 14% and organic ARR growth of 12% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year at a record level of ARR of $1.41 billion, and 2021 EBITDA margin of 25.6%, and operating cash flow of $751 million. Reflecting on our 2021 results in comparison to our May 2018 Investor Day plan, I am proud to say our team made a great deal of progress. In May 2018, we targeted 2021 adjusted EBITDA between 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2021 at 25.6% EBITDA. We targeted software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2021 at 55%. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1 times, and we closed 2021 at 1.11 times. In July 2018, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood above three times and we said we would delever below 2.5 times. Today we stand at 1.0 times. These proof points give us conviction that we are on the right strategic path with Connect & Scale 2025 that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds, to deliver value to our customers, and that our asset-light business model works for our shareholders. Looking at current market conditions, the overall demand landscape remains robust and we enter the year with record hardware backlog and record ARR. Nevertheless, we are paying close attention to three obvious market factors: interest rates, supply chain and labor market dynamics. While the overall landscape presents material short to mid-term planning challenges, what is straightforward is that the global infrastructure spend is a positive catalyst for the long-term health of the business and that in difficult economic environment our value proposition that delivers productivity and sustainability will remain a secular growth catalyst. Moving to page 3. I'll talk about the progression of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, as seen through the lens of the Trimble Operating System capturing strategy, people and execution. Starting with strategy. I'll provide three proof points of our progress in the quarter. First, we acquired AgileAssets, which provides SaaS solutions with analytical tools to manage roads, bridges, airports and rail assets, so customers can better plan, operate and report on those assets across the life cycle. The addition of AgileAssets to Trimble's platform will add the as-maintained model to our as-designed and as-built data. Availability of this data within the model creates a robust digital twin for owners throughout the asset life cycle, thereby providing greater predictability, sustainability and lower lifetime asset costs. Second, we have increased our ambitions in the area of sustainability both internally with our own carbon footprint and externally through the commercialization of sustainability. We have submitted our science-based targets for review, and we plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement. In addition, our most recent score from the climate disclosure project went up again, marking two increases since we first submitted in 2018, and we continue to work diligently to further improve our score. With an external lens, customers are increasingly asking us to help them think about, manage and verify carbon reductions from the productivity and efficiency gains delivered through the use of our products. We have stepped up our ambition level to meet this market opportunity. Third, we have continued to transform our software and hardware business model offerings, which has translated into increased bookings and ARR, which in turn gives us visibility into continued growth in 2022. Our Connect & Scale strategy is a platform strategy, and we are executing that strategy in part by partnering to build ecosystems. As evidence, we have a new Microsoft partnership that will first focus on construction, and we established Trimble Ventures in the third quarter and made our first ventures investment in the fourth quarter. Moving to people in our operating system, I start by reflecting on our purpose in the world. We are transforming and digitizing industries that support how we live, what we eat and how we move. In a competitive labor environment, we continue to see people attracted to the why of Trimble. We won a couple of Global Culture Survey awards in the fourth quarter both for overall company culture and for diversity. We made demonstrable progress in our DEI journey in 2021 and our team continues to engage in their local and global communities through company-sponsored days of service and through our Trimble Foundation. We believe the intersection of a great workplace environment and a purpose-driven organization provides a solid foundation upon which to lead, grow and compete for talent. We were also able to recruit Ann Fandozzi to our Board in 2021. And in January, we announced the addition of Tom Sweet, Dell's CFO to our Board. I'm encouraged by individuals of this global caliber enthusiastically joining our Board and contributing to our ongoing growth. Moving to execution in the Trimble Operating System, we saw the benefits of ongoing innovation throughout the course of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we reached a milestone of one million monthly active users of Trimble Connect. With our digital transformation efforts making progress, we now have all of these users on common identity and entitlement stacks. We launched the new trimble.com web presence in December, the culmination of a couple of years' worth of work to modernize this important vehicle. We've also stepped up our outbound efforts to tell our story and to reach important new audiences. We look forward to hosting some in-person events in 2022 and such as our Transportation User Conference in August and our Dimensions User Conference for engineering and construction in November. Finally, we see our fundamental responsibility to shareholders as being capital allocators, balancing short-term realities with long-term possibility. To this end, we divested three businesses in 2021 on top of the four divestitures in 2020. In 2022, we will disproportionately invest in areas of the company such as the infrastructure opportunity, autonomy and our own digital transformation. We make these investments and are accelerating the transition to recurring revenue models of a number of our software businesses in the context of a challenging supply chain environment, which is constraining our ability to meet customer demand and adding inflationary pressures. The steps we are taking will moderate our operating leverage over the next few quarters but will move us forward in our ability to reach the full potential of our strategy. Before I turn it over to David, a big shout out to all 11,500 plus Trimble team members for your ongoing dedication and execution to our global dealer partners and to our strategic partners for their efforts, and to all of you in the investment community who trust us with your capital. David, over to you.
David Barnes: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $926 million, up 12% versus a year ago. Organic revenue growth was 14%. Our strong revenue in the quarter was enabled by the outstanding performance of our supply chain and operations team as hardware revenue grew by over 20% versus the fourth quarter of last year, notwithstanding the extraordinarily difficult supply chain environment. Backlog of unfilled hardware orders grew in the quarter, reflecting both the strong demand in our end markets and customers placing orders earlier than they would have in the past. Hardware backlog at the end of fourth quarter was nearly four times the level of a year ago before the supply chain challenges emerged. With this strong backlog, we have unprecedented visibility into demand for our hardware offerings going into 2022. ARR grew at an organic rate of 12% driven by business model conversions, strong bookings and healthy customer retention for recurring solutions in the quarter. Gross margins were 57.8%, down 90 basis points sequentially from third quarter levels and down 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins were impacted by the mix of hardware revenue, higher inbound freight costs and our aggressive purchases of components in the broker market to support strong demand. Cost inflation was higher than our expectations and the price increases we took in our hardware offerings did not fully offset an unexpectedly sharp spike in cost inflation in the quarter. The price increases we have taken so far this year, averaging approximately 5% at the list price level across most of our hardware businesses and accompanied by reduced discounting have been accepted in the market. Given our leading position in the markets we serve, we are confident in our ability to maintain attractive margins. And we continue to adopt our pricing strategy to the cost outlook. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 24.1%, while operating income margins were 22.1%. As we expected, margins in the quarter were lower than the fourth quarter of 2020, but higher than Q4 of 2019. EPS was $0.62. We generated cash flow from operations of $155 million and free cash flow of over $140 million. Cash flow was lower than Q4 of 2020, driven by increased component inventory purchases. Turning now to slide 5, let's step back and review performance for the full year 2021. In the face of unprecedented challenges coming from the ongoing COVID disruptions supply chain shortages and accelerating inflation we achieved record results across a broad range of financial metrics. Revenue grew 16% to a record $3.66 billion and the ARR growth improved sequentially. While gross margins were down modestly, due to both inflation and the higher growth of our hardware revenues, EBITDA and operating margins ended the year above the levels of 2020 and at record levels in Trimble's history. Earnings per share were $2.66 up 19% versus a year ago. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 12% and 14% respectively. Now on slide 6, from a geographic perspective revenues were up in all regions with the highest growth rate in Europe. North America revenue in the quarter also grew at a double-digit rate. Turning now to other key operating metrics on slide 7, I'll note that backlog ended the year at $1.8 billion. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago. While backlog and our recurring offerings continued to grow, the majority of this increase came from hardware. And year-end hardware backlog exceeded our expectations of a quarter ago. Our results for 2021 reflect the achievement of a meaningful milestone. On a trailing 12-month basis our software services and recurring revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Operating cash flow of over $750 million was also a record and exceeded 1.1 times non-GAAP net income. Turning now to our results by segment on slide 8, revenue was at or above our expectations in all segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue grew 14% versus prior year and 16% organically. Growth was strong across both hardware and software. Our sales of machine control solutions to civil construction customers grew by nearly 30% this quarter, despite supply chain constraints. ARR growth in the segment was strong with Viewpoint and e-Builder ARR together up at a mid-teens growth rate. SketchUp ARR growth was nearly 40%, while ARR gained momentum in our structures and MEP software businesses as they accelerated their transitions to recurring revenue models in the quarter. We ended the quarter with strong bookings momentum across our B&I Software businesses. Segment margins in the quarter were over 30%, representing a record fourth quarter for the segment despite cost inflation and the higher growth of hardware revenues. In B&I our price increases more than offset the hardware cost inflation, we saw in the quarter. Geospatial segment revenue increased 15% overall and 16% on an organic basis. Demand for our core survey and mapping portfolio remains very strong across all regions driven by strong spending in residential construction, civil infrastructure and utilities. Segment revenues also benefited from shipments against several large government contracts. Operating margins were below the levels of fourth quarter 2020 and the third quarter of 2021, driven principally by a short-term mix shift. The cost inflation we experienced in this segment was largely but not entirely offset by our 5% price increase and lower discounting. Resources and Utilities revenue grew 18% in total and 21% organically. Hardware backlog grew in R&U, reflective of very strong demand across the agriculture sector. The outlook for capital investment in ag remained strong driven by high crop prices, low inventories and high average equipment age. Segment margins were below those of a year ago and sequentially below third quarter levels. Product cost inflation was particularly high in this segment, as the cost of many critical components in our ag product offerings increased substantially in the quarter. In this segment our price increases have not yet kept up with inflation and we continue to refine our pricing strategy going forward. We anticipate operating margins in this segment in the coming year to rebound from the fourth quarter 2021 levels, as our price realization and mix improve. Consistent with our expectation coming into Q4, revenues and margins in our transportation segment were adversely impacted by supply chain challenges, both within our business and at our OEM customers. On the cost side, we experienced meaningful component inflation and high freight costs and we incurred costs related to realigning our product portfolio, toward available components. Slow production levels at our OEM customers also constrained our revenue of both hardware and recurring services in the quarter. The leading indicators from our transportation business continue to give us confidence that we are on the path to better ARR and margin trends, once the dynamics of the supply chain improve. We grew bookings year-on-year once again in Q4 and our net retention is at 100%. Our OEM customers are seeing stabilization in their own supply chain situation and we expect that orders from them will pick up early this year. Finally, on the cost side, we are introducing new products, which will support improved gross margins. For all these reasons, we project improved performance across the Transportation segment and ARR revenue and margins in the back half of 2022. Turning now to slide nine, I'd like to provide our financial outlook for 2022. We expect to see continued topline momentum. Demand from our end markets remain strong and so far, we haven't seen any signs of deceleration as a result of recent inflation and higher interest rates. Our backlog and forward-looking indicators of sentiment give us confidence in our prospects for ARR and revenue growth. As Rob and I have mentioned, we expect that supply chain disruptions will continue to be with us through 2022. There are signs that the pressure on component availability will abate in the back half of the year, but our plans presume that the supply chain will not be fully restored to equilibrium until 2023. With those factors in mind, we are initiating annual guidance for 2022. Excluding the impact of any additional acquisitions or divestitures, we project full year revenue of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, representing a range of growth outlooks of 8% to 11%. Our continuing transition of software offerings will present approximately 100 basis points of headwind to revenue growth. Organic ARR growth is expected to accelerate through the year to a mid-teens rate by year-end. We expect gross margins in 2022 to be comparable to or slightly better than 2021, with sequential improvement in the back half of the year. We expect that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 23%. Note that operating margins will be adversely impacted by the aforementioned subscription transitions, as well as investments we are making in support of our strategy and the acceleration of ARR. In aggregate, these factors present a headwind to operating margins of approximately 200 basis points. Income from equity investments is projected to be approximately $30 million, lower than 2021 due to higher product costs in our joint ventures. Net interest expense is forecast to be approximately $65 million and we project that our tax rate will be approximately 18%. Netting all this out, we project to achieve EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.95. From a cash flow perspective, we project the free cash flow will once again exceed our non-GAAP net income. Our cash flow trends will be helped by the projected return toward equilibrium in the supply chain, as we anticipate needing lower component inventories by the end of the year. While we are focusing our guidance on expectations for the full year, I'd like to provide some color on the factors we expect to drive quarterly trends in 2022. Many of the normal seasonal patterns in our business are being disrupted by the impact of the constrained supply chain, so it is most helpful to think in terms of the expected sequential development from where we ended Q4 of 2021. We expect revenue to grow sequentially through each quarter of the year with ARR accelerating as well. From a product cost perspective, we expect to see inflation through the first half of 2022, similar to what we experienced in Q4 of 2021, with meaningful improvement in the second half. As a result, gross margins are likely to be relatively flat with Q4 of 2021 through the first half of the year and meaningfully higher in the second half. We expect that operating margins in the second half of the year will exceed the first half by approximately 150 basis points. I'll close by noting that we are planning an Investor Day in Colorado this September. And with that I'll turn it back over to Rob. 
Rob Painter: We entered the COVID crisis almost two years ago. And at that time, we set an objective to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing. I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2021 and the progress and commitment we are making towards our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We are a purpose-driven company serving secularly attractive markets, pursuing a differentiated strategy to connect the physical and digital worlds, with a unique set of underlying capabilities. We deliver a compelling value proposition to our customers in the form of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener and we deliver a compelling business model to our shareholders. No doubt, we expect to operate in a turbulent environment for the foreseeable future while simultaneously undergoing our own transformation. The last couple of years serve as evidence, that this team has the courage and conviction to rise to the challenge. Operator let's please go to Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Chad Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys.
Rob Painter: Good morning.
Chad Dillard: So my first question is just on the guidance. So what are you contemplating at the low end of your earnings guide? Because it implies about 3% growth and so as I'm kind of like looking through it, first of all, on the revenue side, at the low end you're at 7%. But if you're talking about price realization of plus 5% and then ARR growth in the teens it seems like that would imply a kind of low single-digit or flattish growth on hardware. So just hoping, you could just kind of just give me a sense for how you're thinking about that low end and the reality of hitting that. 
David Barnes: Hi, Chad. This is David Barnes. I think the low end is 8% revenue growth. And I think your math is right there's some pricing in there. I'll note that the revenue growth will be impacted by about 100 basis points of transition, from perpetual to recurring some of our software businesses. We do expect hardware growth to moderate versus what we've seen this year. We'll be working through the backlog, but those are some of the big building blocks. 
Chad Dillard: Got it. Okay. And then just secondly, on your incremental margins. So the guidance implies about 18%. And during the third quarter, I believe you guys talked about being at the low end of 25% to 30%. So I'm just trying to understand, what changed and perhaps you could just help us bridge that gap. 
David Barnes: Sure. The big -- if there's a change and there is a bit of a change it's that we're going to see more inflation than we had anticipated in the first half of 2022. Our outlook was a little more optimistic on that front. It's now clear that the supply chain being choked up, is going to last at least at some level through the end of next year. And we don't think the inflation scenario, in terms of our product costs will get meaningfully better. The guidance presumes sort of plateauing at Q4 levels. We do expect to see some price realization. I talked in the prepared remarks about margins in Ag. The sort of bad news of a lot of backlog is when you implement another price increase, you don't see it in revenue, right away. So those are the principal factors that would have operating leverage lower than we had indicated earlier. But I will point out that the deliberate decisions we're making in terms of model transition from perpetual to recurring, and then the investments against our strategic initiatives, each of those takes 100 basis points or so out of margins that we would have next year, if we weren't doing those things and that would generate very healthy operating leverage. 
Rob Painter: Chad, one other piece of color on that is compare 2022 in the mid guide to 2019 and we're talking over 45% operating leverage over that time. 
Chad Dillard: Got it. Thanks I’ll pass it on. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open. Please ask your question. 
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. There's a lot of obviously volatility in the supply chain. Could you be a little bit more specific, if you're willing on what is getting better into 2H, what you have visibility on? There's some talk on chips getting better. I don't know if that's been a big headwind. And then just your general feeling, is it stable in 1Q? There's obviously a lot of Omicron tick up potential and things like that. I don't know if it started getting better already in any ways? Thanks.
David Barnes: Yeah. Hey, Rob. I'll say that the supply chain challenges you hear a lot of talk about semiconductors, but the issues are broader than that. With regard to electronics, I would say things are already improving. Part of that is that we several months ago took a number of steps including raising our outlook and making commitments with vendors placing orders that actually impacted our cash flow. We've worked component by component. We've seen meaningful progress. We're actually seeing visibility to capacity on some of our individual constrained parts with specific vendors. So that's getting better. And the fruits of our effort to redesign our products around very scarce components all of those show signs of improvements. Actually, where things are stickiest now is the non-electronics. It's cables, it's brackets, it's other kinds of parts. And that is sort of the downstream impact of labor disruptions in many markets all around the world. So that probably has a longer fuse to it. But you put all that together, that adds up to the outlook we described in the prepared remarks, which is yeah, we'll see inflation in constrained overall supply through the first half of the year and we'll see meaningful improvement albeit not all the way back to normal by year-end.
Rob Wertheimer: And then begging your pardon, if you're willing to be so granular, you mentioned you have backlog so you don't have pricing coming through and resources and so on. The back half margin improvement, is that more pricing? Is that more like you assume expedite freight goes away? Is it more proven in all the things you just discussed, if you're willing? And I'll stop there. Thank you.
David Barnes: Sure. There are many components. Looking at inflation, I think you can group it in a few buckets. There's the underlying just price increases from the suppliers and from our freight providers. And then there's expedited freight, where you use air freight instead of seaborne freight for instance. And then there's buying components in the broker market. And when you buy components in the broker market, the price can be not a few percent higher, but multiples higher than the normal purchase price. So the outlook for improved margins in the back half of the year is that we have a lot less of the use of the broker market. We have less expedited freight. We do think though that there will be underlying inflation that will be with us. But you'll see the full impact of the price increases including the ones we haven't taken yet or where we've taken them, they haven't flown through the backlog. And then over time, the mix of our business will improve. I'll point out that our revenues were up about 12% in the quarter and our hardware revenues in Q4 were up 20%. So that's not helpful to margin. And all those -- that will abate as well. So we add all that up, we think that's how we get to meaningfully better margins in the second half than the first half.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Thanks.
David Barnes: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Colin Rusch: Thanks, so much. I want to ask about the AgileAssets acquisition. I just wanted to get a sense of the speed of the integration into the Trimble platform, and how you're thinking about the digital trend opportunity in terms of customer engagement and expansion of total addressable market?
Rob Painter: Hi. Good morning, Colin. It's Rob. So hey, AgileAssets fits perfectly into our strategy. We think it's really in the center of the bull's-eye. It's a growing SaaS business and it connects well with the broader Trimble platform. So it is a growth story and we've got a high conviction that we can grow this business on its own and that it can be a catalyst for the growth of other Trimble solutions. When we put it in context of the digital twin in the prepared remarks, we talked about this intersection point of the as-maintained model with an as-designed and an as-built. So if you think about it from the life cycle point of view, which is really central to our strategy, this adds really that final step in the operations and maintenance phase. And so a digital twin in its truest form is much broader than a design model and often people will talk about it more in a design sense. We think the combination and intersection of the design with the as-built with the as-maintained is actually a true digital twin and the early indication we have from joint customers and from departments of transportation is quite encouraging to us. 
Colin Rusch: Great. And then shifting gears to the transportation and logistics business. With the real progress that's being made around Class 8 trucking moving towards autonomy and the more comprehensive software systems that we're starting to see emerge in that space. How are you thinking about evolving the strategy for Trimble in that space? It seems like there's an awful lot to do, but also a lot to shift around. And so the cadence of change would be helpful just in terms of your internal thought process and how you see that business evolve for Trimble?
Rob Painter: We see autonomy as it emerges in transportation. I'd say at some level similar to agriculture or construction. And that is in an autonomous world which by the way is probably really more of a more automated world in an autonomous world, the truck still needs to have a work plan. It still needs to understand how to route and how to navigate. It still needs to understand how to optimize within the entire fleet. It still needs to understand how to give a dynamic estimated time of arrival to the customer. It needs the brains behind it. Arguably, the autonomous vehicle or dozer or tractor is a dumb node. It doesn't know what to do. It needs a work order. It needs a work plan. It needs that brain. And that intersected with what we do at Trimble in the office the systems of record, the scheduling, routing, dispatch we think provide high relevance in a more automated world. In addition there's autonomous capabilities that we can provide companies on highway. So for instance in our correction services business, we now have over 10 million miles that have been managed through our correction services which are really providing ADAS capabilities. 
Colin Rusch: That’s super helpful. I will follow-up offline. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Tami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So the Resource and Utilities margins in the quarter came in below where we were expecting. Can you expand on that a little bit? And why do you expect unfavorable mix in the near-term? And related to that what is your outlook for agriculture demand longer term in light of farmers moving towards vision and AI technologies?
David Barnes: I'll defer the longer-term question to Rob. With regard to margins Tami, there's a story both of mix and of higher input costs. There are a number of key components in our displays for guidance in agriculture where the supply was particularly tight. I mentioned a moment ago that when the markets are tight we and other providers of hardware technology have to go to the broker market to fill the needs. And in some cases a part that would normally cost $3 costs $30 or $40. So it's easy to see really dramatic cost spikes that happened disproportionately in this segment. So we've taken pricing actions. But in this particular segment the cost increases are meaningfully higher. So we're relooking at our pricing strategy and we're going to have to take some actions to improve our margins going forward. We do think there's partly a story of mix here and what we were shipping in Q4 is disproportionately on the lower end of the margin scale. So it will get better. But no doubt we have a margin challenge to wrestle with in this segment. And Rob you want to talk about the longer-term outlook? 
Rob Painter: Yes. Actually the other thing -- color I can add to the numbers is you know the revenue in the segment was up over 18%. ARR was in the mid-teens growth. Agriculture hardware revenue was above 30%. That's -- put the margins in context of the extraordinary growth we have in this business we are making conscious choices to meet the demand the extraordinary demand that's out there in the market. And we saw, the backlog continue to grow in the business. So really feel good about the market demand out there. And there's a correlation between the extraordinary demand and the margins. So those factors, as we move forward that's part of why we think we can – that will come to equilibrium. In terms of the ongoing outlook in agriculture and our views on that, hey, the indicators look good at the moment in the agriculture business. So the macros are in support of the growth plans that we have. If we look at farm income, it's projected – 2021 was probably the high point for farm income. The expectations for farm income in 2022 are 20% to 30% above the 10-year average. So punch line is farm income is expected to remain strong. That's a US statistic that, I'm giving you. And that's able to outpace the increase in the inputs that – input prices, sorry – that farmers are paying. So the reason that farm income can stay up is, because commodity prices are up they remain up and inventory levels remain low. Now, look at the input prices being higher and connect that to a point of view, we have on the adoption of technology on a go-forward basis. That's exactly what the technology can do is it can minimize and optimize the use of those inputs. Less seed higher yield; less use of herbicide to spot spray, which also by the way brings a sustainability benefit to the farm. So those factors in aggregate continue to have us bullish on the adoption of Precision Ag technologies going forward, and I'd say also on a global basis.
Tami Zakaria: Understood. That's helpful. That's all for me. Thank you so much.
Rob Painter: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Gal Munda: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe the first one just trying to understand a little bit the dynamics around the business model transitions, maybe if you can update us a little bit. And when you say expectations about 100 basis points headwind to kind of the margins and the growth for FY 2022, which are the brands that are mostly impacting that? And maybe, if we look forward, how long do you think that headwind still lasts? And at what stage it almost becomes a tailwind as well once you kind of cross that majority of the revenue being subscription based on some of those brands as well? Thank you.
David Barnes: Sure, Gal. It's David. I'll look both a little bit backward and forward. So for the full year, the measurement we do indicates that the transition impact in 2021 was about 100 basis points negative impact to revenue. That's actually less than we thought going into the year. And the reason, it's less is that we had higher last-time buys of perpetual offerings in our structural design business. So right now, the impact the vast majority of the impact the 100 basis points whether it's for full year 2021, or full year 2022 are in our building software businesses. There's a decent chunk in the transportation business as well. Actually, we're going to see a piece of it in the civil software – civil construction software business, as we roll out our platform-as-a-service model. So you asked about the longer outlook. I'll tell you that the – if you look at our perpetual software revenue just under $500 million for 2021, we're already at a point where 70% or 75% of that perpetual software is sold bundled with hardware. So the straight software offerings are only 25% of it, by which I mean to say, we will at the end of 2022 be through the significant majority of the model transitions on the straight software businesses. But we are looking to transform to recurring revenue models the platform-as-a-service where – that's where we're moving, and we'll have some meaningful revenue in civil construction this year. We also have bundled perpetual software with hardware in the surveying business and in Ag, and that will be further out. So it's a little early to call on, how long that transition will take. Actually that's a topic we plan to cover off at our investor conference in September. But that's less straightforward to transition than a traditional software business. You've got -- you're bundled with hardware, you've got multiple regions and dealers. And so it's a harder problem to solve. It's likely to take several years.
Gal Munda: Got you. And then maybe as a follow-up. When I look at the -- it still has a negative impact on the margins. But like we said, if the transition stopped today on what you've already transitioned, it seems like incremental margins are being helped, if that makes sense, if we excel that, because if I calculate correctly, we're into kind of four of these incremental margins that we had kind of that two basis -- two percentage points of less of a headwind this year to what you expected and 100 basis points of that is actually coming from business model transitions. So if I look at an organic as it is today business, as it stands, and as it's already -- if you weren't transitioning it, is it fair to say that the outlook for the margins would have been kind of higher than historically has been on incrementals? 
David Barnes : Yes. So I think I'm following you Gal. The margins are really high on both perpetual software and recurring. The difference is that when you sell subscription, you recognize the revenue and margin over many years rather than upfront. So I think our math is good that the conversions we're doing reduce revenue versus if you'd stayed in the perpetual model by the numbers we're saying and it essentially all goes through to the bottom line.
Rob Painter: And Gal, this is Rob. You're absolutely right by the math. If we were only targeting an op leverage number, you wouldn't do the transitions, that's the wrong decision to take for the customers and for the market. So you're absolutely hitting on an important point that we will all day long look to convert the business models for the long-term health of the business. And I think it's more important or certainly equally important that the Street is looking at the growth in the ARR, the look on our cash flow, the net working capital as factors to complement what an EBITDA percentage or an operating income percentage will tell you because it's an incomplete story.
Gal Munda: Great. Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone.
Rob Painter: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about the outlook for mid-teens ARR growth exiting the year. Really interesting outlook considering e-Builder and Viewpoint are delivering that level of growth now. So I'm wondering what needs to happen in transportation to get to that run rate. Or are you looking for an acceleration or further acceleration in e-Builder and Viewpoint to get there? Maybe just give us a little bit more clarity on what drives the acceleration from 11% today?
Rob Painter: Hey, Jerry, this is Rob. I think that is arguably the story in this earnings release is the level of ARR growth that we exited the year with meets the ARR projection that David went through in the prepared remarks. You can look at the backlog that we have, the reported backlog that's in the financials, as evidence that we have a growing amount of revenue to serve. So, in other words, we've got a high level of visibility. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter in aggregate. So, yes, the e-Builder and Viewpoint businesses, those continue to grow ARR in the mid-teens. And I'll say, bookings were -- grew faster than that. So the bookings are the forward indicator to the revenue that will eventually be recognized. Now the other catalyst on top of that, Jerry, is that structures business that we talked about were -- that's the Tekla Structures business that made the model conversion in 2021 that will be part of that growth in 2022. Yes, we do anticipate some increase in transportation, but this projection that David made is not entirely dependent on it. In fact we have rather modest expectations on transportation. So to the extent that that is a lot better that could be a little potential upside for us. So, we are squarely focused on growing the recurring revenue, the digital transformation investments we're making, David talked about that, almost 100 bps of investment we make into that. That's the correlation to make to the ARR growth. It is an enabler of that ARR growth and we're absolutely committed to these transformation investments in order to drive these attractive revenue streams.
David Barnes: Yes. Rob got it right, Jerry. We're at or close to mid-teens in the ARR growth of our businesses other than transportation. We're much lower than that in transportation. And we do project a recovery. We don't think we'll get all the way to numbers we think are good long-term by the end of the year, but the outlook presumes that we maintain and put some momentum across the businesses that are growing well now outside transportation and the transportation begins meaningful growth. So you put all that together, we get to mid-teens. And if we do even more than that then we'll be on the high end of our outlook. But that's how we get there.
Jerry Revich: Very interesting. And David, based on the numbers you shared on SketchUp, it sounds like user growth has tripled in that business, give or take since the transition to subscription. Are you on track with that level of performance in Tekla? And are you thinking about the remaining conversions that are in front of us with that type of user growth potential, or were there any outliers on SketchUp that we should be thinking about?
Rob Painter: I'd be careful about extrapolating from SketchUp to all the other businesses. Certainly, the SketchUp story is an amazing one. It really is sort of great flagship example of how changing the business model expands the addressable market on SketchUp. It has a quasi-consumer appeal, which Tekla would not. It's a very sophisticated product. So we're early days in the model conversion on Tekla. I don't think you'll see the expansion in the addressable market in that offering that we've had in SketchUp.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Jason Celino: Great. Hi, Rob. Hey, David. Appreciate the morning call this time around. As it relates to M&A, the business has delevered very nicely over the past couple of years. And with these Connect & Scale initiatives and streamlining the business, how should we think about M&A strategy and specifically, where larger M&A might fit in?
Rob Painter: In context of Connect & Scale, I think about two dynamics. One -- actually, I think three dynamics. One is our own organic progression and we -- the second is acquisition and the third is partnership. From our own organic progression, we believe we have an immense opportunity just to mine the data and the customer opportunities within -- I'll say, within the house. In other words, the cross-sell and the up-sell within the Trimble portfolio as evidence of that is our Trimble Construction One launch where we're creating persona-based bundles to go after the construction industry to better serve those customers. So, that's our primary use I'll say of capital allocation. Second, from an acquisition standpoint, we're definitely open to acquisition, not for the sake of acquisition if it helps accelerate the strategy. And so the two vectors we tend to look at on acquisitions are: one, product capabilities; and two, geographic reach. Sometimes, those are the same and sometimes, they're mutually exclusive. The majority of acquisitions we've done over time have looked more like a tuck-in than transformative and large ones. We've tended to do the larger ones every few years. And I wouldn't say that's by design. It's been more by availability. So we are certainly open to that. There's a bit of a bifurcation in the market where there's the really, I'll say, almost mega caps, at least mega cap defined in a Trimble context, and then the long tail of small companies. There's not too many in the middle. So, there's a bit of a scarcity of assets. So, we're absolutely open to it. We obviously have the balance sheet and we think we've got the right strategy. So if the fit is there we will pursue. On the partnership angle, I mentioned that because in a platform strategy, which is what connected scale is, we believe that partnerships are more important than ever to build out that ecosystem. We have a long track record of partnerships. We've got a joint venture with Caterpillar in civil construction; we've got a joint venture with Hilti in building construction; we've got a joint venture with Nikon in our survey and mapping business. We announced that relationship with Microsoft, a few months ago. We think that that is an important partnership to help us extend the reach and the capabilities of what we do. And as we open up, our technology to third parties and those ecosystems to help us extend that I think that's another point of evidence, of where our partnerships will come into play. And then I'd like to believe, that those partnerships which could also come through a Trimble Ventures arm could become acquisition candidates down the road.
Jason Celino: Okay. Interesting. And then when I think about this year and the focus on investments in infrastructure, economy and digital transformation, is the correct way to think about this maybe at the product level, the go-to-market level and then also at the back-end system level? Thanks.
Rob Painter: Yes, I think that's a fair way to think about it. I -- the words I tend to use internally are strategy structure systems. I believe an organizational structure follows the strategy and I believe the underlying systems are meant to be enablers of that structure and ultimately the strategy. So in the strategy of Connect & Scale, we see an enormous opportunity around the infrastructure bill since I think that's what you were asking about, when you said infrastructure. You may have meant our internal infrastructure. But if we're talking the IAJA, we see a large opportunity there that connects to the acquisition of AgileAssets to bring more aspects of Trimble together to positively impact the opportunity inside of construction. So within that strategy, then we organized ourselves. Well, sorry, actually also on the strategy side, yes that captures product and go-to-market. So I totally agree with you there. You've got to have -- and the product looks like the Suite, the collections of our technology and the go-to-market for us has as you look in the totality of Trimble has a hybrid aspect of direct and indirect that comes together. Okay. Then on the organizational structure side, we organize ourselves around the industries that we serve. So we have an industry leader for civil construction, for building construction, for agriculture, for survey and mapping for transportation. So we have that single point of accountability, to those end markets that we're serving. And then the underlying systems that captures some of the digital transformation systems work that we are doing, to give us that ability to better serve customers and to help us scale efficiently and effectively. 
Jason Celino: Thanks, Rob. Thank you
Rob Painter: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason [ph]. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Good morning. Rob, you had noted the platform-as-a-service opportunity lies ahead of you still for the most part. How should we be thinking that impacts the recurring revenue gross margin or recurring gross margin as that occurs? The simple math would suggest some hardware mix flows towards that line item. But is there an opportunity for in, which case -- at a gross margin level would the math suggests somewhat dilutive but is there an opportunity there the strategy there to make that less so than maybe face value would tell you?
Rob Painter: Yeah. I'll give you the strategy setup and David can fill in the blanks on the numbers. So platform-as-a-service, that's the I'll say the branding name we've had on the machine control and guidance business in civil. In other words, think about taking that guidance business as a ratable offering that combines hardware and software. The fundamental value proposition to the customer is that of technology assurance, being able to stay on the latest version of sensors, or software, gives them ability to better connect to the office-based solutions we have and the connectivity solutions we have, to really round trip the data to and from the field to connect that physical/digital, to connect the office/field, connect the hardware and the software. So that's the reason and the value proposition that we pursue this. So let's take a guidance system and let's just use round numbers and say it's a $30,000 system today that a customer buys. In that system, you're buying a set of sensors, hardware and embedded software. The embedded software is actually what drives a lot of and creates a lot of that value. It's the enabling aspect of it today. Now today, the way the accounting works is we would take in that $30,000 example, we would take all of that revenue today. The way the accounting works is that the value is attributed partially to software, perpetual software and -- so that embedded software attributed to perpetual software and then the rest to hardware. So that's where David refers to it as a bundle. So what we see is that more and more of the value comes through the software aspect of the offering. And so that software aspect of the offering, so the portion of that $30,000 that's attributed to software that's what we look to take -- that's one of the things we look to take ratable over time. And that's a global offering that we just announced. Now in the US, we've been doing the whole thing as a ratable service. The accounting makes you take the hardware upfront even though it's ratable. And it's that software that you can take over time. And this global offering that we now have, that's the primary offering buy the hardware upfront and then the software becomes ratable. So in the short term, I think that's a hit to margin just like you would have in any software business that moves from perpetual to ratable. What we need to then be able to demonstrate through the numbers and it probably shows up as a term license and therefore in the ARR number is that we can show that ARR growth and link that to any offset in the margin. Now that's the short term. As you build the cumulative base, your margins slip and then you actually, as we know get back to parity and then have the value expansion opportunity from there, just on the base offering and that's before we talk about the upsell and the linkage to the rest of what we do. Dave, would you add anything? 
David Barnes: No, I think you nailed it, Rob. So even when you sell a bundle of hardware and software and solutions together, just the way the accounting works, is you figure out how much of the value is hardware and you do recognize that upfront. I think what's -- but the mega trend going on here that's in the context of the model transition, as Rob said is more and more of the value is with the software and solutions and relatively less of the hardware. So the impact on the P&L of the transition whereas today, historically the way we do it we recognize all the hardware and all the software and solutions upfront. As we go ratable on the software and the services, that will have a similar impact that it does on all of our other software businesses. So it will -- what you'll see in the accounting is the hardware still stays upfront, although hardware makes up less and less of the value of the old solution. And then when you go ratable on the solution, then the software part gets spread out overtime.
Unidentified Analyst: I see. I see. Thanks for the explanation. I'll just -- one quick follow-up. Just David, as you think about the guidance for revenue for 2022, what are you assuming in terms of backlog reduction within that call it 9% to 12% or so organic?
David Barnes: Yeah. So I'll ground it in the -- my comments and the notion that the supply chain won't get back to equilibrium even by the end of 2022. So just round numbers hardware backlog in a normal world is $100 million. We're at nearly four times that somewhere around $375 million. We're likely to get halfway back or more than halfway back, but still be well above the 100 level.
Unidentified Analyst: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Weston Twigg: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know you talked about ARR this year. But really I'm wondering if you could help us understand, your revenue by segment in terms of which segments may grow faster or slower than the overall top line revenue. And the reason I ask is, just because you mentioned certain supply chain constraints worse in the agricultural area. And I'm just wondering how much that might slow down revenue in certain segments. So any help there would be great.
David Barnes: As a general trend, it's unlikely that we'll see hardware revenue outstrip total revenue like we did in the fourth quarter. The other book end, I'll put it that obviously our transportation revenue trends have been more modest than the other segments, and we do expect in the second half of the year an uplift in transportation. But the rest of the businesses are actually quite similar in the sense that demand is very strong backlog is big. Just by the numbers Geospatial of these segments is most hardware related. So we've just had extraordinary growth. And it's -- we're outgrowing by everything we can measure the market in those solutions. So you're likely to see that segment slow more than the others, but we have a really big backlog in construction and agriculture. And yes, so I think you'll see lowest growth in transportation particularly in the first half. Geospatial, just because its hardware dependent will be lower and the other segments will be -- we expect to be very strong.
Weston Twigg: That's very helpful. And then, just to follow up real quickly. Gross margin you suggested it would be higher in the second half kind of similar to Q4 through the first half. What kind of level can you help us understand what kind of level gross margin could hit exiting the year as supply chain starts to get back to normal?
David Barnes: I think the math is probably pretty easy, if we end up near where we were in Q4 for the first two quarters. And then we'll end the year at or maybe modestly above full year 2021. That will -- I think that gets you there. It will be -- the modeling of that won't get you to 60%, but it will get you closer than the 58% where we are now. So ...
Weston Twigg: Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. You may continue.
Rob Painter: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. And we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Trimble Third Quarter 2021 results. At this time, all participants’ lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  To ask a question during the session, [Operator's Instruction]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator's Instruction]. I would now like to head call over to your speaker today, Mr. Rob Baker, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Rob Painter: Welcome everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page two with the key messages we want to convey today. In the Third Quarter, our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so within an incredibly difficult supply-chain environment.  We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of 1.36 billion up 8% year-over-year, and up 11% on an organic basis. Total revenue growth of EBITDA margin of 25.9%, and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $784 million. We achieved record third quarter levels of revenue in many of our businesses.  With another exceptionally strong quarter in machine control and civil construction, guidance in agriculture and Survey and Mapping. For results demonstrate the strength of the underlying market recovery and the quality of our execution against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. Our results also demonstrate the quality of the Trimble team.  And I want to give a special shout-out to all our colleagues, led by Leah Lamberton, who are helping us manage through the supply chain challenges on the basis of this collective strength, we are raising our annual earnings guidance despite a tightening supply chain environment. With start with market conditions where the overall land scape remains robust.  Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure, translating to strengthen in our Geospatial and buildings and infrastructure reporting segments. We remain optimistic that the Infrastructure Bill will ultimately be passed in the U.S., which would bolster our long-term outlook in our construction and surveying businesses, starting at some point in 2023.  We have been and are building product and go-to-market capabilities ahead of this opportunity. I'm especially proud of the role Trimble has played in leading policy advocacy in support of technology adoption, most specifically around advanced digital construction management systems, which provides State Departments of Transportation, with access to funding, to help them accelerate adoption of proven digital design and construction technologies.  We will continue our commitment and support to the nation's Federal Highway Administration and State Departments of Transportation and their pursuit of achieving sustainable and state-of-the-art project delivery. In Agriculture and Forestry, commodity price strength continues to translate into customer buying power and our backlog remains strong.  We are tracking inventory levels of major Ag products which remain in a healthy position and provide some line of sight to continue d farm financial strength. Which we see as an important counterbalance to rising input. Costs on the policy front, we have been advocating for legislate legislative proposal called SB27 -50, Precision Agriculture loan program act in the U.S. that provides low cost loans to farmers to incentivize adoption of precision technologies.  Outside the U.S., we also see positive conditions including ongoing subsidies. And we are beginning to see more policies that promote the use of technology to increase environmental sustainability in transportation, we had another quarter of solid bookings growth, improved customer retention, and higher operating margins.  In September, we announced a strategic relationship with Procter & Gamble, which will shape the development of an agile procurement collaboration platform and will in turn complement our existing set of supply chain focus solutions. Success looks like expediting contracting and onboarding processes to increase the velocity of business transactions while enabling more efficient movement of freight.  I'm also pleased to report that we were the first major technology provider to certify in Canada for the Canadian ELD mandate, evidence of the positive shift in product delivery in the business. On the downside, supply chain is especially disruptive to the operations of many of our trucking customers and will likely constrain our ability to see our execution progression flow through the near term P&L.  Let's turn to Page 3 and talk some about some notable progression of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy seen through the lens of the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy people into execution. To set context, our strategy is an industry Platform strategy that manifest and bringing the best of Trimble together with Eco. The system partners to transform industries that support how we live, what we eat, and how we move.  On the heels of cop 26, we're also convinced that we can have a profoundly positive impact on addressing climate change through the use of technology. As approved point of our strategy, we are excited to have announced on October 27th the formation of a strategic partnership with Microsoft to build market and sell our industry Cloud platforms and solutions that connect people, technology, tasks, data, processes, and industry life cycles.  Our initial focus will be to build a Trimble Construction Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure. Importantly, we will also partner on joint go-to-market strategies to globally delivered these cloud innovations. As an additional strategic proof point, at our annual user conference for viewpoint construction management software business, we announced the transition of viewpoints branding to Trimble.  At this user conference, we also launched Trimble Construction 1, as shown on page four. Which extends the capabilities of viewpoints, current SaaS software suite with new and exciting capabilities from other parts of the Trimble Software portfolio.  In addition to the viewpoint financial and operational management capabilities, Trimble Construction One incorporates Trimble's estimating and detailing solutions, as well as Trimble's advanced project management offering, in a single integrated package, which is now being sold by multiple Trimble divisions.  Our direction is clear. We will continue to expand the capabilities of the Trimble Construction One platform for our civil and buildings customers to further connect the physical and digital worlds across construction field and office workflows. On people, we continue to be recognized as a top Company culture and Fast Company recognized us as a best workplace for innovators.  In an increasingly competitive job market, melding Trimble's mission with our innovative culture, is top-of-mind for our talent attraction and retention efforts. As evidence of the attractiveness of Trimble, in September we hired Jennifer Len as Chief Platform Officer and Poppy Crum as our Chief Technology Officer. Both world-class talent who see and believe in our vision and the potential of Trimble.  On execution, we continue to innovate. Our MX50 Mobile Scanner launched in the third quarter, [Indiscernible] a beta release of SketchUp for iPad. And we continue to enhance the capabilities of our best-in-class high-accuracy correction services, which enable positioning down to centimeter levels globally.  We are investing heavily in our own digital transformation, which will provide the system and process fuel to deliver our increasingly connected solutions in an efficient and scalable way. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to talk about how we are operating and leading in the current environment, which presents both volatility and unprecedented opportunity. For years, we have talked about our 3-4-3 operating model.  3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. I see the role of Trimble leadership as being stewards of capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders, where we balance short-term realities with long-term possibility. As we move towards closing out 2021 and end to 2022, we will continue to support the incremental investments we are putting towards our digital transformation, autonomy, and infrastructure opportunities.  We have high conviction that these investments will create new, sustainable, and differentiated long-term growth opportunities Trimble. And we remain bullish on the long-term secular opportunity for digital technology to make our customers more successful, productive and sustainable. We will have the courage to look through near-term supply chain disruptions in upfront cost of our digital transformation. And to hold ourselves accountable to progressing our Connect & Scale strategy. David, overview.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $9101 million up 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 1% in divestitures subtracted 2% for a total organic revenue increase of 15%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.7% down 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting several factors including higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, offset by increased pricing and lower discounting.
Rob Painter: Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9% down 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher operating expenses and investments in the business. Operating margin was 23.8% down 40 basis points year-over-year, but still up over 300 basis points versus the pre-COVID third quarter of 2019. Operating expenses last year were unusually low in a number of areas, including compensation expense.  Net income dollars increased by 10% and earnings per share increased by $0.06 to $0.66 per share. Our third quarter cash flow from operations was a 166 million and free cash flow was a 156 million. Cash flow was down modestly year-over-year in the quarter. As we are purchasing inventory in response to strong demand and supply chain shortages.  Operating cash flow is up 23% on a year-to-date basis, with a conversion ratio to net income above 1.1 times. Our net debt declined 88 million in the quarter, and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 0.9 times. During the third quarter we repurchased a $100 million of common stock.
David Barnes: At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available in our revolving credit facility and approximately $513 million in cash. Our balance sheet is strong and we are well-positioned to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. Turning now to Slide 6, I will review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends.  As mentioned earlier our ARR was up 8% in aggregate and was up 11% organically on a year-over-year basis. The 11% rate excludes the impact of foreign exchange and our recent divestitures of IRON Solutions, Manhattan Real Estate Solutions, and Construction Logistics. All three of these divested businesses had a recurring revenue component, but we're in areas outside of our strategic roadmap. Our non-recurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 18%
Rob Painter: Year-over-year and perpetual software growing 19%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction Geospatial and Agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth. As some of our hardware offerings are. Bundled with perpetual software. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 11% in Europe, revenues were up 18%.  Asia-Pacific was up 5% year-over-year and the rest of the world was up 33%, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector in Brazil. Next on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics we follow, and I'll start with ARR. While total Company ARR grew 11% organically on a year-over-year basis, ARR excluding transportation, grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter.  Networking capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, continued to be negative, representing approximately -2% of revenue on a trailing 12 month basis. Notwithstanding an acceleration in purchases of component inventory during Q3. Research and development on a trailing 12 month basis was 15% of revenue, and our deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year.  Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion up from $1.5 billion a quarter earlier, and up over 30% year-over-year. While growth on our backlog is an indicator of momentum in the business, it is also reflective of the shortages and extended delivery times that we are experiencing for many key components in our hardware products.  Of our 1.6 billion in backlog, just under $340 million relates to our hardware offerings, up from about a $100 million in hardware backlog a year ago, and $38 million higher than the end of Q2. We expect supply chain constraints for many key components to extend well into
David Barnes: 2022. Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil Construction businesses and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter.  Geospatial revenue was up 23% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment’s. Margins were up 60 basis points due to both revenue growth and operating costs control. Resources and utilities revenue was up 23% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture and positioning services offerings.  Margins in resources and utilities contracted 330 basis points and were hardest hit by product cost inflation in the quarter. Financial results in transportation show ed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 3% on an organic basis year-over-year, but grew less than we expected due to supply chain challenges, both in our operations and our customers' businesses.  Margins expanded 410 basis points year-over-year. Turning now to Page 9 for our updated outlook for the full year. We are raising our expectation for full-year revenue with a new range of $3.59 billion to $3.64 billion, representing growth for the full year in the mid-teens and single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. End market demand is even stronger than we thought it would be a quarter ago.  But supply chain constraints will likely cause our backlog to remain at or above the increased levels from the end of Q3. Air or growth at the Company level is trending as we anticipated, driven by strong bookings and subscription transition. And we expect organic [Indiscernible] growth of greater than 10% in the fourth quarter and a strong entry point going into 2022.  Gross margins in the fourth quarter are likely to be about flat sequentially with the third quarter. An increasing mix of software will have a favorable impact on sequential gross margin trends. But this benefit will be offset by an anticipated decline in hardware margins. In aggregate, we now expect that the net impact of accelerating hardware cost inflation, and our recent price increases will be modestly negative to hardware margins in Q4.  Building off our strong third quarter results, our outlook for operating margins continues to improve, and we now expect operating margins for the full-year 2021 will be above 2020. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of this year will likely be lower than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven both by higher hardware component costs year-on-year, and by higher operating expense as OpEx was unusually low in 2020, and we're now ramping up investments against our strategy.  Our outlook for full-year earnings per share, has increased to $2.61 to $2.69, representing growth of approximately 17 to 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating cash flow greater than 1.1 times net income and free cash flow greater than 1 times net income, reflecting the strong cash-generated aspects of our business model. I'd like to comment briefly on the outlook and fourth quarter for our transportation segment.  As Rob (ph) mentioned earlier, the leading indicators for this business are strong with growing bookings of recurring solutions, sequentially improving customer retention in our mobility business, an increasing sign that are connected transportation strategy is resonating with customers.  Nevertheless, factors related to the global supply chain and the extraordinary pressure on the transportation industry will negatively impact our business momentum in the short run. Our OEM business will be constrained by customer manufacturing challenges. And the aftermarket business will be slowed by the fact the trucking companies are reluctant to take assets off the road for technology upgrades, at a time of high transportation prices and extraordinary asset utilization.  We believe that these constraints will be resolved over time and we remain confident in the turnaround of this business. But the pace of improvement of revenue, ARR and profitability will be lower than we had earlier projected. With regard to 2022, we don't plan to give detailed guidance until our year-end earnings release, but we can characterize some of the drivers that we see now.  And there is expected impact on revenue ARR and margins. Demand across our end markets remains strong and we believe that strength will sustain at least through the end of 2022. Our customers need for digital solutions to optimize their workflows has never been stronger and these customers have the money and the desire to invest.  We expect organic ARR growth to accelerate in 2022, building off the momentum we have now and aided by continued model transitions and the growing sale of connected recurring solutions. The supply chain environment remains our biggest challenge and that challenge is predicted to be with us for several more quarters.  From a cost perspective, we anticipate that inflation in our hardware businesses will be sustained through the first quarters of 2022, driven both by higher component costs and higher cost of getting products shipped to our manufacturers and distribution centers. It is the goal of our pricing strategy to offset the impact of inflation on our hardware gross margins, and that pricing strategy continues to evolve.  Rob referenced in his remarks, the investments we are making against our digital transformation. We anticipate that as we get through this investment cycle in 2022 and as our software businesses continue their transition to recurring revenue models, our operating leverage will be lower in 2022 than we expect over the longer term.  The investments we're making in our digital transformation are at the core of unlocking the potential of our platform strategy. And we expect to end 2022 with business processes and systems that will accelerate our ability to transform the way we go to market, and the way our customers do their work. With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator's Instructions] Your first question is from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ann Duignan: Yes. Hi. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about the outlook for 2022 and what you see across the different segments. I know you said in some of your opening comments that you do expect an infrastructure built path. If that doesn't happen would that influence your outlook for 2022 at all for buildings and also Geospatial?  And then the [Indiscernible] in Agriculture which continue to see farmer sentiment decline on higher input costs, not just in the U.S, but also in Brazil. So maybe talk about some of the pluses and minuses that you're seeing out there as you look to 2022, and the end-markets. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Hi, and thanks for the questions. This is Rob. So I'll give you a walk around the end markets and some of the positives and some of the potential gotchas that we're looking out for. And the things we're looking out for that could be to the negative would be around supply chain inflation in labor availability and of course, all of those things correlate.  On the Geospatial and Construction side, we see strength in residential and infrastructure work right now we see on the commercial side strengthen sub-markets such as data centers and hospitals. We believe there’s an indicator that the residential work will drive light industrial work as it relates to the infrastructure bill and if it doesn't pass, we would see a benefit of the infrastructure bill really in 2023. So we really don't expect anything in 2022.  Of course, there's a sentiment aspect that's hard to quantify, but are -- but we remain that optimistic and I spent some time in Washington a couple of weeks ago to that end. And when I think about construction and I think about the labor side of it as a potential downside. The benefit of technology is that it can make an inexperienced operator good.  Our Geospatial market or robotic total station can turned to person operation into a one person operation. On the Ag side, what's positive our commodity prices, it looks like the harvest -- early data on the harvest would suggest a lower harvest, which would hold up commodity prices and then the index that against the ending stocks or the inventory. As you said, absolutely input inflation, I think is what's starting to dent the optimism on the farmer front.  With that input inflation, though I look at the value proposition of the of the technology. So a spot spray technology can reduce the use of herbicide. And that's a really big deal, where the variable rate can reduce the use of the other inputs. And as we know, also has a positive environmental sustainability benefit.  At a Geographic level the subsidy policies tend to be more consistent and higher outside the U.S., so that tends to be -- provides a ballast, let's say to the overall market, but we're absolutely paying, attention to all of this at some point. This is -- we'll have to have an impact. On the transportation side, what we see is strength in spot pricing and I mean, we even seen it from our own rates on transportation as David talked about them, where they've gone up.  A downside is driver availability in the market and availability of trucks coming out of the OEMs so carriers are having trouble actually adding capacity. And when I think about a technology lens on that, an average driver effectively uses around 7 hours of their clock per day. Our strategy is to drive a more connected supply chain.  That means dynamic schedules with the shippers and the receivers to better optimize wasted driver hours. We provide better routing and navigation solutions to create efficient trip management. And fundamentally, we want to get at more accurate order [Indiscernible] load information for the customers. And that can increased the network optimization. So there's puts and takes as always, and we think that technology has a role really in almost any market condition.
Operator: Your next question is from Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Devin Au: Hi, this is actually Devin on for Jason, potentially taking my questions. First one I have on construction. Just wondering if you could provide an update on I guess, e-Builder and viewpoint. I know that you guys re-branded, but any color on EAR growth and growth drivers there would be helpful.
Rob Painter: Hi, thanks for the question. So the combined ARR growth between the 2 businesses was set up plus 17% year-over-year. So another great quarter of execution between the 2 businesses. As you noted with the rebranding, we are especially optimistic around the Trimble Construction One offering. We converted over a 1,000 customers to the Trimble Construction One offering.  Sold dozens of new logos onto the offering in the quarter and that -- bookings that creates ARR later down the road but the value proposition and the awareness from the customers is quite encouraging. And we've seen that in the bookings for some time now and which now plays through the ARR expansion.
Devin Au: Great, that's helpful. And just one more, and staying on construction and you are definitely encourage to see the connected construction. On platform, but just want to ask are you -- in terms of like market opportunity, are you still mainly displacing these legacy systems that they were based processes out there or are you seeing meaningfully more interest from contractors and owners looking for a more connected solution?
Rob Painter: There are both. It's a good question. From a market -- overall market perspective, really the secular opportunity and construction technology, by the way, I would see this in our other end markets as well. Is that these markets are large. They're global, they're underserved, and they are underpenetrated by a technology.  So the move to digitization provides a value proposition that delivers productivity, quality, safety, efficiency, transparency, the environmental sustainability. So there's a positive catalyst for technology to be adopted. And at some level, yes, that is replacing paper-based systems. That exists or let’s says just the mental based systems that exist.  And we are seeing demonstrable interest from customers in the connected solutions that we offer and I've had a chance to talk to a number of the customers personally, some that are shown us how they're already taking our technology and connecting the various solutions to improve their workflow. And one of the things they do is not only connect a Trimble workflow, but an Trimble environment that can provide actually accommodate environment.  We can connect in an open and really agnostic way to the other technology that our customers use. Customers operated as you know, in the construction industry is fragmented. Therefore, the technology tends to be a bit fragmented as well. And so our ability in approach to connect Trimble and non-Trimble solutions is very top-of-mind for customers.  And of course, COVID has also been a catalyst from a digitization perspective. So much of what we do, can uniquely connect the work in the office and the field that connects the hardware and the software and ultimately that physical and digital.
Devin Au: Great, that’s good to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer of [Indiscernible]. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, thank you. And Rob, thanks for that answer. I actually would like to follow-up on a couple of points you were making there. Just on the future of digitalization [Indiscernible] construction, I wondered -- there's a very large opportunity. Do you feel like there is an acceleration? Is there a tipping point where we're visible in the next 2 or 3 years or X time frame where you have to be digital or you're not there?  Just a general sense on how fast that market is moving. And then do you think it's coalescing around 2 or 3 sort of platforms, yourselves being one of them. And that's kind of the Construction one idea or is that too aggressive statement? And it's still a hodgepodge of a bunch of different assets, maybe just asking you to assess the competitive platform dynamic as well. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Hi Rob and thanks for the question. From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology. And if we were to get an infrastructure bill, which by the way, we're talking about that in a U.S. context.  But we see a construction lead recovery really globally in many markets. And so HS2 is a really nice project in the U.K., [Indiscernible] and Paris. The rail project is expected to be a very large project, and there's large projects happening and Saudi and Australia continues to have some big development.  We see the fundamentals in the macro's providing ability to accelerate it. I think, really, the move to have the digitization, COVID I really do feel has accelerated that perhaps hasn't inflected so many of our customers were unable to actually go out to the field like they used to go to do or they realize the need to be Cloud connected in Cloud -enabled when they weren't going to their offices at frequent, as frequently.  And we think that's helped us drive more bookings in the business to the cloud offerings. And as it relates to a tipping point that's a really good question. That's a bit of a crystal ball. I think one of the catalysts that could create a tipping point, would be if we see more of this driven from owners. And I will say as well as regulators and maybe I really mean policy when I say that.  So from an owner perspective, that's actually the premise of why we did the e-Builder acquisition because who fundamentally has the most at stake when a project's late or over budget, of course it's the owner and so we help them manage their capital programs. From a policy and regulatory perspective, where we have a point of view as we the [Indiscernible] take that U.S. infrastructure bill as an example.  I mean this is a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the united -- of the infrastructure in the U.S.. And we can deliver that infrastructure 20%, 30% cheaper through the use of technology. So it just makes sense.  And so, if more of this, if we can increase the level of awareness, I'm certainly an [Indiscernible] that there's a policy measure here are certainly encouragement measure, and that's why I talked about that digital construction Management Act because it provides an incentive for DOTs to adopt technology. I'd say we're all staying tuned for that one. There is something that's sort of fundamentally creates an acceleration on that -- on the tipping point part of it.  And then you asked about platforms, Rob. And on the platform side, I think it is logical to think that there would be some coalescing around a few platforms. I mean, as you said, the industry is rather fragmented. We're not the only technology platform out there actually. I think there needs to be interoperability between those technology platforms, and that very much shapes how we build our technology. It is an underlying fundamental belief that we have.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Rob Painter: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question is from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to maybe start out with some of the supply chain issues. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what the increases in lead times look like for your customers and have you seen any potential losses given the extended backlog and potentially delivery times?
David Barnes: Hey, Jonathan, it's David. The lead times vary a lot by product, but historically, our lead times have been very short measured in a few days. And there are many times that, so weeks and in some cases, many weeks or a few months, and that's the math of the backlog that you're seeing. As far as the competitive dynamics, in a very few isolated cases, we can identify where we've lost business to a competitor that can supply more quickly.  Typically they are competing at the lower end of the market and in some cases those customers have come back. But I think the generally our competitors are experiencing at least similar pressure to where we have and we don't believe that this has had an adverse impact on our share trends. In fact, in our hardware businesses where we can see numbers that are published by our peers or competitors.  There is evidence in many of those segments that we're gaining share. We also haven't seen a meaningful amount of orders being canceled because the lead times are extended. So it's something we're watchful for. We're lucky as Rob said in his comments, have a really capable of. Operations team that has done a remarkable job getting supply in this very difficult environment.
Jonathan Ho: Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, just given the strength in your Ag business, I'm wondering, are you seeing a change in the types of products that you're selling into that market, especially relative to historically when it was sort of focused on guidance systems? Are you seeing sort of that broader digital transformation happening in this segment as well? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Hey Jonathan. It's Rob, I'll take that one. I'd say the product mix is relatively stable at the moment. What I would say, we're doing a better job of is connecting the software and the hardware and the correction services into the offerings that we have some more of that bundling at a point-of-sale and making ourselves easier to do business with.  We have picked up some new OEM customers along the way, and then we've seen some strength in -- particular strength in various geographies. So in the quarter Brazil was very strong for us. Russia was also very strong for us. So there's, I'd say there's pockets, geographic pockets, where we're able to increase the penetration. In terms of a discernible shift in the overall mix of the portfolio. Not really at this point.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon, and good evening. I was wondering, Rob, if would you mind expanding on the recurring bookings growth you folks outlined in your prepared remarks and transportation, I think it's the most positive tone you've [Indiscernible] transportation in a while. Can you just unpack that? What part of the business is driving the recurring growth and what do the churn rates look like on the legacy business where we're working through the headwinds. Thanks.
Rob Painter: Sure. Hi, Jerry thanks for the question. Within the transportation business, historically talked about 3 legs on the stool though the technology stack. The first being that we provide mapping, routing, navigation engines. Second, that we provide the back office technology for trucking companies. And third, that we provide the field mobility tools for companies. In terms of the booking and then those are the 3 historic legs of that stool.  And then over the last couple of years, we've moved as well to address the shipper side of the market whereas historically this strength is on the carrier side. On the carrier side of the business, where we see the bookings, growth is in a couple of places. So first in that [Indiscernible] ERP systems, we called it a Transportation Management System and we're moving that business to a recurring model. So there's a model conversion that's happening in there.  And we have seen evidence that we're increasing the size of the addressable market, which means we're reaching some customers that we hadn't previously reached. And that's translating into 20% plus bookings growth on a year over year basis in that part of the business.  What we're seeing as well on the mobility side, which is really more of the EOD part of the business. As we have seen, some life there, both through two things. 1,... increasing penetration and existing customers as some of our existing customers, actually many of them are adding capacity given the market.  In fact, they would like to add more capacity in many cases aren't able to actually get the vehicles are the drivers to do it, but that's one area where we see growth. And the others as we do see some logos are coming back to us, which has been a really good sign for us. Still a long way to go, but I'm liking what I'm seeing from the team, and the pace of the team, and the trajectory and that Canadian ELD certification was a nice proof point that we're not just talking about these things, that we are actually also are delivering.  That mapping, routing, navigation business has had many, many years of double-digit recurring revenue growth, which means bookings continue to grow strong and they continue to do a great job in quarter-in and in quarter-out. [Indiscernible] up and that got to the commentary on the script. You asked Jerry about the churn rate as well.
Jerry Revich: [Indiscernible]
Rob Painter: Yeah. On the churn rate side, I'd characterize it in net retention, and net retention was above 100% in the quarter, which is obviously a great sign for us.
Jerry Revich: It's really nice to hear about the inflection there and you know in buildings and infrastructure, I know you have really good visibility on the prospective pipeline and bookings. Can you talk about if you've seen an acceleration in those lead indicators that you track for e-Builder and viewpoint, given the labor shortages, etc. Could we actually see ARR accelerate further from the strong rate that we're running at in 3Q.
Rob Painter: So, yes, actually we do think we can accelerate the level of our growth actually across the Company. And then that being the biggest contributor really to that growth, it absolutely -- it's something that we have a line of -- reasonable line of sight to after the current bookings growth as we plan the business forward, we'll think about in any given quarter or a year for that matter, what's quote-on-quote in the bank and then what's the go-get when we think about that go-get than you can measure the pipeline you have and then you measure the qualified leads you have against that.  So you kind of just keep working backwards from that equation and then do you have the horsepower to go and possible effect the pipeline and to turn it into a booking which eventually turns into the revenue. In addition, Jerry another catalyst to rest coming into next year is, our structures business. So that will [Indiscernible] business, the steel concrete business, so that in the summer, we stopped selling perpetual licenses.  And so -- in fact, we sold more perpetual this year than we had anticipated and now that we're off the -- almost entirely off the perpetual, that just by the math will provide a catalyst for ARR our [Indiscernible] bookings, which will turn into ARR so that alone would be a catalyst to our ARR growth in that business looking into next year.
Jerry Revich: Thanks, Rob.
Rob Painter: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question is from Weston Twigg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Actually I have 2, if you'll allow it. First, just the Geospatial segment has been growing really strongly. And I'm just wondering if you could help us just get a fuel for those trends through next year, how sustainable is this rate of growth?
Rob Painter: Hi, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. Big kudos to the Geospatial team. The latest innovation that went to market in the third quarter was the MX50 Mobile Mapping System. And that's on the heels just really many innovations over the last few quarters between the X7 Laser Scanner our [Indiscernible] receiver a really nice run for this. The business has I'd say a pretty good amount of backlog associated with it.  As we look forward into 2022, we think that we do have the [Indiscernible] at our backs and that we can continue to grow the business. Now the stunning growth that we've had in that business in 2022 or 2021, excuse me. No, I don't see that that wouldn't progress as we've said a few years ago, we -- that this was we think thought of it as our most mature of the businesses that we have and it has proved to more than once lately to be the -- one of the fastest growers within Trimble on a year-over-year basis, so really a lot of excellent innovation.  And as well, our go-to-market team has just done an outstanding job with the channel management around the world. And I would expect that to temper back somewhere closer into the Company average of the 6 to 9 organic range as we go into next year. I would take that as a starting point.
Weston Twigg: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had, you mentioned the cop 26 conference, the discussions around there, and with all the severe weather events this year and how this impacted your customers, I'm wondering if you could maybe discuss some of your broader revenue opportunities with respect to climate change adaptation. Specifically, thinking about some of your agricultural construction infrastructure customers. And maybe outweighing broadly speaking, how that revenue opportunity could ramp.
Rob Painter: Oh, thank you for that question. So I'm excited and I'm actually quite inspired by the ability Trimble to play a fundamentally positive impact, or a fundamentally positive role in impacting climate change. Now, the truth of the matter is that our products and our technology have had a positive environmental, sustainability benefit for as long as we have been around. I mean, it's been a byproduct of the productivity and efficiency that our customers generate.  What I see as an opportunity is that comes more and more to the forefront. In some cases, it's just our customers have more reporting to do themselves. Whether they realize it now, some of them do and or rather they don't, we see that coming and then we see an ability to go to move into that space. If you take Agriculture as an example, we do have a small business in Ag that essentially runs a carbon marketplace.  We get calls from customers or potential customers asking for help in certifying the offsets that they're buying. Think about our -- we tend to talk about our Agriculture business, but we also have a nice forestry business. These are two places that are hugely important in this conversation. And so as big companies are making their own commitments and buying offsets, they don't want to buy bad offsets.  And so we're encouraged by the types of calls that we're getting because it's giving us conviction of where we take our product road map to positively impact us. I mean, if I think about the construction space, our structures business, so the steel part of the structures business.  We did an announcement a couple of weeks ago of something that I think is pretty compelling as we can continue from a design perspective, essentially to design for sustainability, to understand the carbon load that a building has during that design and engineering phase. For many years, we've had a pre -design product to help you understand, let's say the energy consumption profile of a building.  And as the users of the buildings on let's say, if there becomes regulatory pressure on this, to design with carbon in mind, the constructible models that we provide at Trimble have a profoundly positive ability to impact designing and maintaining and operating with sustainability in mind. So we're actually putting some -- our resources to this.  Because I see, all of us at Trimble see or board sees some really interesting opportunities that at some point will turn into commercial opportunities. Now that they turn into commercial opportunities is something discrete and separate, or are they part of the existing technologies we have? I would see there I don't know. But you follow what's going on and you've got -- I've got to believe that there's some material business for us to have here.
Weston Twigg: That's really helpful and thanks for all the effort in that category for sure. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Chad Dillard of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Chad Dillard: Hi, good evening, guys.
Rob Painter: Hi.
Chad Dillard: I actually want to go back to Trimble Construction 1, I was hoping you can give a little bit more context on where it belongs in the prior portfolio. My first question is just on just how much overlap does it a have versus your current product offering and then maybe you could talk about at least like your initial sales, whether you're seeing more come from conversions versus new customers. And then secondly, it to extend to this new platform expand the opportunity to [Indiscernible].
Rob Painter: Chad, so this is Rob, I'll take the question. So where to start? Our Trimble Construction 1 offering, essentially right now can take what we do at viewpoint. I mean, at viewpoint, years ago, we moved from selling, I'll call it an ERP on an office - based solution to moving to selling a combined team and Field Solutions, so think, project management and field mobility tools. And we called it viewpoint one and then we caught an [Indiscernible] office team field offerings.  So it moved from a point solution to a bundled viewpoints solution and now that next step is and to Trimble Construction 1, what the first release of it. That brings in many aspects of our MEP business. So it's mechanical, electrical, plumbing business and we're able to bring in detail or an estimator workflows into the product offering.  And then from there, we have a basis where we can continue to expand across other architectural and engineering workflows and products that we have. So by and large, it's taking what we do already and having a better packaging around that. Making it easier for our customers to consume the technology.  From a technology perspective, it's better integration, tighter integration between the solutions that we have. Our customers have been asking for this, and so we're really excited to be able to start delivering upon it. I would say it's just the start. It's Version 1 of Trimble Construction 1. There are many other capabilities that we believe we can bring into that both from a civil perspective as well as a vertical construction perspective.  And the natures of the conversions we have thus far are predominantly with the existing customers and moving them over. But we did get a few dozen new logos during the quarter on Trimble Construction 1. It's very much a persona based growth platform. We think about personas and in architectural engineering work persona, we think about a contractor persona.  We think about an owner persona. And then we'll as we migrate over time will get -- be able to get more and more. I'll say specific and targeted to delivering Construction, Trimble Construction 1, to those individual persona.  So I'd really say the start of much more to come and the more that we connect the data, the users, and the workflow across this data be gets the opportunity to move into richer data, AI opportunities. And there it gets then another level of exciting so the more we can connect what we've got for our customers, the more of that will create solutions down the road.
Chad Dillard: Great, thanks for that. Second question, more so on your hardware business, just trying to understand the progression of price cost and maybe you can just walk us through what the price cost balance. It was 1Q, 2Q, 3Q.  I think you said for 4Q, it's negative and then I guess most importantly, where do we go from here for this year? If I remember correctly, there's a portion of your business that is under [Indiscernible] longer-term contracts and when do those anniversary up get up for a renegotiation.
David Barnes: Hey, Chad, let me give you some perspective and all sort of ground. My comments in what we mentioned last time, when this very uncertain world we were estimating that for the full year 2021, we'd have inflation in aggregate of about 6% of our $600 million in COGS, so that's $36 million. We're definitely running north of that. We're probably about $10 million more in product and freight inflation than we were anticipating.  And we've adopted our pricing strategy all year in response to our best guess of where things are. You're right there's some latency in -- when you can make a decision and implement the strategy, and it really differs by business and customer. In some cases, we can implement a price increase by smarter and less discounting.  Some cases there's a surcharge that's possible, some cases, you have to wait for a list price. But I would say our pricing momentum has kept up with the inflation outlook that we started with. But we're running behind because inflations [Indiscernible] than we believe. So your understanding is correct. We're behind inflation now.  Even though the pretty much the full impact of our price increase came through in Q4 will be modestly negative, not hugely modestly negative. Going forward it's a very tough world to guess cost inflation. And we think it's not going to get better soon. We're optimistic it won't get a lot worse. We have some more work to do on the pricing front, but I would say in aggregate, it is still our view that over time we can offset the inflation costs impact with pricing. It's just going to take us into next year to do that.
Chad Dillard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Kristen Owen: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Christian on for call, thank you for taking the question. Just. And to follow up on some of the commentary around the connection Scale and sort of the acceleration of that spend into 2022, just wondering if you can provide an update on sort of the internal processes that you're going through where you stand in those and any metrics around identifying what that opportunity set is based on the multi-product customers.
Rob Painter: Well, hey, Kristen, this is Rob from let's say, to put context around where we're spending the money, digital -- around digital transformation, and we believe through that digital transformation that that will in turn lead to inability to scale our revenue growth, particularly the recurring revenue growth and the growth of bundled offerings.  We do believe there'll be an Infrastructure Bill that comes and even if it doesn't come, we believe there is a fundamental ability for us to play a positive impact within infrastructure to have it is built better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener. So we've been -- we have been putting more resources to that which we in turn think will help us grow the business.  And we take up both the short-term and long-term view when we come to extent the questions around how we actually come to that answer. And we believe it's the right thing to do for the business. But I think it'll only have answered half your questions, so sorry. Tell me what else we can help with. [Indiscernible]
Kristen Owen: The internal processes, where you are in that process of identifying where you can create synergies internally, how you're going to market more efficiently. Just sort of connecting the internal data backbone. An update there would be really helpful.
Rob Painter: From an internal perspective there, actually, I like the progress we've made through our annual strategy exercise as we do each of our major franchises. I'm have defined there what Connect and scale means to them. And our industry. Cloud strategies are Platform strategies that relationship with Microsoft. And we think is a really big deal for us and where we take the business going forward.  We've got demonstrable success on digital transformation efforts with some of the underlying plumbing that we're putting in place. So things, like, common identity, licensing, entitlement engines, which really are just the call of the must-haves table stakes for where we're going as an organization.  Most of our businesses of identified where they see cross-sell, up-sell opportunity within the customer -- within, I'll say common customer personas. So I like the work that we're doing and in preparation, I wish it could come faster. How about these things do have a bit of a natural course they take.
Kristen Owen: And then if I could, the follow-up to a previous question related to the hardware sales versus our growth. Just wondering, given the strength that you've seen in hardware over the last, call it year or so. How we should think about that as a precursor for ARR growth. Thank you very much.
Rob Painter: Well, most of the ARR that we have is independent of the hardware, where I would say there is a potential precursor as we've talked before about our machine control and guidance business and our -- and civil construction that obviously has hardware and software associated with it and where we've moved to a recurring offering there.  So to the extent that that influx and we see more adoption of that and we have been seeing more adoption of that regardless of how the accounting has treated on it from a practical perspective, it does become more recurring and have an ability to drive that.  In addition, the more we connect that hardware and the software that they have overall, there, I think we see a large installed base of customers or have our hardware that would benefit also by connecting [Indiscernible] to office software to combine with a field hardware. So I do think there's an opportunity there, Christian.
Operator: Your next question is from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erik Lapinski: Hi team, this is Erik [Indiscernible]. Thanks for squeezing us in. Maybe, just a follow-up on that last question, when we think about some of the incremental investment you're planning over the next year. I was going through this process of connecting more of the assets that whether they were acquired over time or kind of built separately at all, impacted your appetite for M&A? Just wondering if that is a factor.
Rob Painter: No, I'd say it hasn't impacted it all. We will look at acquisitions where we think it can accelerate this strategy, and have a positive impact on Connect & Scale and building out our industry platforms. We also think more of these days is about partnership, and I think Microsoft is a good example of that there's multiple paths to get to this strategy.
Erik Lapinski: Thank you. I mean, maybe if I could squeeze in one more. You talked about the high-teens growth in viewpoint e-Builder, but when we look at overall subscription growth, somewhat flattening organically. Can you help us understand what areas of subscription grew somewhat slower? Is that mostly related to the transportation segment or there are any other factors?
Rob Painter: Transportation segment.
Erik Lapinski: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Ed Magi Berenberg Capital. Your line is open.
Edward Magi: Hi, guys. This is Ed Magi on for Gal Munda. My question relates to the Microsoft partnership with Construction 1, how much of this is technology partnership versus go-to-market efforts? And what do you estimate the timing for GA for this I'd love to hear some examples of new products that could follow after. Thanks.
Rob Painter: Hi, this is Rob. I'll take the question and thanks for the question. So technology and go-to-market from and from a GA perspective on the on both of those intersecting -- I think next year, mid-to-late, next year would be about the time to think about GA. And then before then from a technology perspective, we get, I'll say incentives and help to move technology that we have. So it helped us accelerate the velocity and the development efforts.  So we get some help on the technology side, there. Our nature of relationship does give us a better pricing on the Cloud cycles that we consume. And then yes, the idea is to build the Construction Cloud powered by Azure. And in doing so, we believe there are some unique and novel things that we can bring to that construction Cloud and just think about the breadth and depth of what we do at Trimble.  And now mapped out at a go-to-market perspective, you've got tens of thousands of sellers between Microsoft and Partner network on top of the sellers that we have on a global scale and quickly get a sense of why I am very excited about the opportunities to help us with reach and scale. as a result of this relationship. And we do think that there's some really interesting technologies to combine between the two companies and stay tuned for more on that in time.
Edward Magi: [Indiscernible] the question and congrats to the quarter.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Rob Mason of [Indiscernible]. Your line is now open.
Rob Mason: Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I'll try to be real quick here. I just wanted to clarification first the commentary around Connect and Scale investments for this year. Could you confirm, did you say that you thought you would be back on model with respect to incremental margins in 2023 or did I hear that correctly.
David Barnes: Hey, Rob, It's David. So I think I'd characterize our comments is sort of broad outlook to 2022, little early to talk about 2023, But just add a little more color. We are in an investment mode in the areas that Rob talked about in digital transformation, in autonomy, and in our major accounts. Go to market activities, which are all really critical to take advantage of the strategic opportunity we have.  And those are likely to result in OpEx, growth next year ahead of revenue growth. So I think we'll have, if you look back to the 2018 Investor Conference and the objective stated was operating leverage in the 25% to 30% range. I think we'll be in that range, but in 2022 at the lower end. And then I think it's logical to expect that we will have some of the positive benefit of that beginning in 2023. But I'll be cautious about making it firm prediction now.
Rob Mason: Sure, sure. Maybe the follow-on that is, if there was some news in the quarter around where you do have some autonomy exposure. Customer, they're planning to ramp some of the technology they leveraged from you. And how should we think about when that does happen, if it happens when -- is that more step function or is that more linear with, I guess the volumes around that?
Rob Painter: [Indiscernible] take more linear with volumes.
Rob Mason: Okay. Very good.
Operator: No questions at this time. I would like to return the call back to Michael Leyba, for further comments.
Michael Leyba: That concludes our call, everyone. Thank you very much and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Rob Painter: Thanks, everybody.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Trimble Second Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  And I would now like to hand the call over to Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. In the second quarter, our team delivered outstanding results. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.35 billion, up 11% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 29%, EBITDA margin of 26.4% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $798 million. We achieved record levels of revenue in many of our businesses, with exceptionally strong performance in machine control in civil construction, guidance in Agriculture and Survey in Mapping. Our results demonstrate the quality of our strategy and our business model. On the basis of this strength, we are raising our guidance for the year. Turning to market conditions. The overall landscape is generally robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure. We remain optimistic that an Infrastructure Bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would further improve our long-term outlook in our Construction and Surveying businesses. In Agriculture and Forestry, commodity price strength is translating into customer buying power. In Transportation, market strength has shifted back to carriers and this, in addition to improved execution, is translating into solid bookings growth. As discussed last quarter, we are investing in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and are stepping up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble Cloud Platform and our autonomy efforts. Our team is highly focused on executing our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which centers on building leading industry cloud platforms. Our strategy differentiates at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. As an example, our hardware businesses allow us to capture data and execute work in the field, while improving the efficiency and efficacy of workflows between the office and the field. At Trimble, we develop our strategies with an endgame backwards mindset. We balance short-term and long-term deliverables with our 3, 4, 3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. This is worth noting as quarterly comparables are skewed with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions. We have to be able to see through the performance of any given quarter and play the long game, which we continue to believe presents a compelling secular opportunity. We are focused on metrics such as ARR, backlog, EBITDA and cash flow as much as we focus on revenue and EPS. The combination of these metrics presents a more holistic picture of our performance.  Let's turn next to Page 3 for some proof points that the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy, people and execution is producing results. Starting with strategy. We continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. In Buildings and Infrastructure, our structural steel, concrete, mechanical, electrical and plumbing businesses are hitting their stride with their business model transformations. Bookings, ARR growth and new logo wins are evidence that the team is expanding the addressable market. In Transportation, our recurring bookings were up significantly year-over-year, also evidence that the conversion is working. On the divestiture front, we closed the sale of Manhattan Software in the second quarter and IRON Solutions early in the third quarter. Since January of 2020, we have divested or exited 8 businesses. We are focused on building our industry-leading and cloud-connected technology platforms that enable customers to transform workflows by connecting Trimble and third-party capabilities. On people, I'm pleased to report that our leadership team was recognized by our employee base as one of the top leadership teams in a Global Culture Survey. We were also recognized as a top-performing company for women and diversity. And our engineering team ranked as a global leading team. I'm proud of my colleagues and our purpose-driven culture. It's this team that is transforming the way the world works. In addition, we strengthened our Board of Directors with the announcement that Ann Fandozzi will join our Board in the next couple of weeks. On execution, we continue to innovate. During the quarter, we announced an autonomy partnership with HORSCH. We extended our machine control platform to soil compactors and we introduced our infrastructure BIM collaboration software in North America. In addition, one of the proof points we monitor is cross-sell annual contract value. Early wins in Construction and Transportation increase our conviction that we are on the right track with our bundled offerings. Turning to Page 4. I'm excited to announce that earlier today, we launched Trimble Ventures, our corporate venture capital arm, with a commitment of $200 million of capital. Our objective is to co-invest in Series A through Series D rounds in emerging technologies as well as in companies that will extend our industry platforms. Our co-heads of Trimble Ventures include our Treasurer, Phil Sawarynsky; and Ron Antevy, Co-Founder of our e-Builder business. In closing, it was the second quarter last year where we faced the initial and biggest uncertainty with COVID-19. While the virus and its variants remain highly concerning around the world, I want to step back and reflect on an early principle we established, which is we said we would emerge from the pandemic on a stronger relative competitive footing than when we entered the pandemic. Our results demonstrate we are doing exactly this. My gratitude to my 11,000-plus Trimble colleagues and our global partners and customers, we've got this. David, over to you.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on 5 with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $945 million, up 29% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 27%. Customer demand was healthy, rebounding across all of our end markets at a rate stronger than we anticipated. Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.2%. Gross margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the shift in mix in our business, with a higher percentage of hardware this quarter and the onset of product cost inflation given the disruptions we are seeing in our supply chain, partially offset by lower discounting. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, up 70 basis points, driven by higher revenue. Operating income margins expanded 110 basis points to 24.2%. As expected, our operating costs were up meaningfully from the second quarter of last year, when we had unusually low compensation expense and a very tight focus on cost control in light of the COVID lockdowns. Net income increased by 40%, and earnings per share increased by $0.20 to $0.72 per share. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $201 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $190 million. Our net debt decreased over $225 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $484 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in a bit more detail our second quarter revenue trends. As noted earlier, our ARR was up 11% in the quarter, with organic ARR growth of approximately 10%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a high teens rate in the quarter. Encouragingly, ARR trends in Transportation improved with segment organic ARR approximately flat versus a year earlier. Our nonrecurring revenue streams experienced strong growth relative to the second quarter of 2020, during which our business was most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 shutdowns. Our Hardware revenue grew 47% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Civil Construction, Geospatial and Agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 23%. In Europe, revenues were up 41%. Currency fluctuations positively impacted growth in Europe by about 9%, with the balance coming from catch up on project activity, which has slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. Asia Pacific grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Australia and New Zealand. The Rest of World, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 49% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the other key metrics that we follow. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Our deferred revenue grew 14% year-over-year. An important story this quarter is the growth of our backlog. Total backlog at quarter end was approximately $1.5 billion. Of that total, approximately $300 million relates to unfilled orders for hardware products. This compares with hardware backlog of about $100 million at the end of the second quarter last year, which is a more typical level for our business. In this time of both exceptionally strong customer demand and increasing supply chain pressures, our operations team did an extraordinary job, which enabled our record year-on-year Hardware revenue growth of 47%. Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 22% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses, with Hardware revenue across the segment up greater than 40%. Segment margins were down 40 basis points, due primarily to revenue mix. Across our recurring software offerings in this segment, bookings were strong, up approximately 25% versus a year ago. Geospatial revenue was up 48% on an organic basis. We saw a rebound in demand across nearly all of the end markets for our Geospatial offerings, and our new products are generating significant customer enthusiasm. Operating margins were up 430 basis points due to strong revenue growth and the success of new products. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 32% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in Precision Agriculture and Positioning Services. Margins expanded 160 basis points. Top line results in Transportation met our expectations. Revenue was up 9% on an organic basis year-on-year. The drivers of revenue growth were improved trends in both our mobility and enterprise businesses. Margins declined 170 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to increased mix of low-margin hardware and increased operating costs, but margins improved sequentially over first quarter levels. We remain confident that we are on track for continued sequential improvement as the year progresses. Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Our performance in the second quarter and the strength of our backlog give us the visibility and confidence to raise our outlook for the year. I'll point out that supply chain constraints continue to present us with meaningful uncertainty as the availability of some critical components remains unpredictable. The outlook I'll describe represents our best sense of this dynamic environment. I'll also point out that comparisons versus the quarters of 2020 are difficult to draw meaning from as the impact of the onset of COVID and the recovery following market reopenings created large swings last year. We will focus more on sequential evolution from the second quarter through to the second half.  We are raising our outlook for the full year revenue to between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion. Demand remains resilient across all of our end markets, but our Hardware revenues will likely be constrained by our ability to source key components. Note that this new revenue range incorporates our divestitures, including the recent divestitures of our Manhattan Software and IRON Solutions businesses. Divestitures will reduce our revenue growth in 2021 by a little over 100 basis points, but are reflective of our increasing focus on platforms, which connect the workflows in RT end markets. Sequentially, we expect that revenue in the second half will be well above 2020 levels, but below the levels we realized in the first half of 2021. The expectation of lower revenue in the second half versus the first half is entirely driven by constraints in our supply chain. We expect to end the year with hardware backlog at levels similar to the end of the second quarter. Given our strong bookings trends across our recurring software businesses, we expect organic ARR growth of approximately 10% for the full year. We anticipate that second half gross margins will be down approximately 50 to 100 basis points below second half 2020 margins, due to the net impact of product mix and cost pressures, partially offset by price increases. We are implementing price increases across many of the product lines impacted by the recent inflationary spike. But overall, the net impact on gross margins will still be adverse year-over-year for both the back half and full year 2021. We expect to experience the greatest gross margin pressure in the third quarter as we won't realize the full benefit of our price increases until the fourth quarter.  Our outlook for operating margins has improved as the leverage from higher revenue more than offsets the impact of mix shift, increasing product cost inflation and the investments we are making in support of our strategy. We now expect that operating margin for the full year 2021 will be comparable to 2020. Note that our software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring are accelerating in the back half of this year. These transitions will adversely impact operating margins by 150 to 200 basis points in the second half of 2021.  Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.45 to $2.65 per share. From a cash flow perspective, given our strong performance in the first half of 2021, we expect cash flow from operations for the full year of greater than 1.1x non-GAAP net income, with free cash flow comfortably exceeding non-GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
AshokSivamohan: This is Ashok Sivamohan on for Jerry Revich. Can you talk about the ARR growth for e-Builder and Viewpoint? And out of the growth, what proportion was from new logos?
RobPainter: The total ARR growth for the combination of Viewpoint and e-Builder was 17% in the quarter year-over-year. As it relates to new logos, we had actually strong performance in the quarter on new logo bookings. So it's a good sign that the Connect & Scale strategy is bearing fruit inside of Construction.
AshokSivamohan: Okay. And in Resources and Utilities, one of your customers is acquiring a competitor. Can you talk about your views on the competitive landscape as it relates to Trimble?
RobPainter: Well, to set context for the competitive landscape, let's start with the macros in the agriculture market. As we all know, it's -- the commodity prices are high, and that is fueling a positive farmer net income. So there's an attractive backdrop against that, farmer sentiment is high, new machine sales are strong. So the place to start is at the top level with the market conditions that are positive. And you see that playing through the results in the Resources and Utility segment, and the team did a really nice job in the quarter and really through of this year.  From a competitive landscape perspective, actually, what I want you to hear is that CNH is an important customer of Trimble. And so we expect that relationship to continue to go forward in a positive light, and that's been -- that's consistent with the signals that we've received thus far.
Operator: We have our next question from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
JasonCelino: Can we talk about this $200 million venture fund? Should we think of these as moon shots? I mean how does it fit in your Connect & Scale initiatives? And then with the business leader from e-Builder kind of co-leading in, is this going to be more targeted towards the Construction side?
RobPainter: Jason, so the -- I'll say the thesis behind Trimble ventures is twofold. It's to accelerate platform investments as well as the technology ecosystem. So from a technology ecosystem, think about emerging technologies that could relate to augmented reality. It could be in blockchain. It could be in IoT or autonomy. And that plays across all of Trimble potentially. And then from a platform perspective, Connect & Scale is synonymous with an industry platform strategy. And so I'll use the two interchangeably. We want this venture fund to participate with companies who can be part of the Trimble platform and extend the customer value and value proposition. And that also we could see playing across the breadth of Trimble. Having Ron Antevy, who comes from the e-Builder business we think is a great thing, because he is a lifelong entrepreneur who plugged into the bigger company at Trimble, and we think he's got the right, the mindset and the network to help companies succeed inside the Trimble platform.
JasonCelino: Okay. Great. And then one, if I can sneak in for David. It sounds like the lower discounting is being able to offset some of the higher product cost but sounds like its still a lot of kind of a negative net impact with the mix. I guess, can you maybe provide a little more color on the level of discounting change versus the higher cost?
DavidBarnes: Jason, first thing I'd point out is that the significant majority of the impact, both on the cost and pricing side, isn't yet reflected in Q2. Its much more of the impact is in the back half of the year. We have been ratcheting down our discounting from the old prices already for a couple of quarters now. And the way to think about it is that, that ongoing reduction in discounting was sufficient to offset the cost -- most of the cost increases we had in the quarter. For the back half of the year, what's going to happen is that much more of the cost increases we're seeing for our hardware products, some of which, by the way we believe are -- majority of which we believe are temporary in nature and they're related to the dislocation of the overall supply chain. But those are kicking in, in full force now here as we entered the third quarter. We are taking top line price increases across essentially all of our hardware offerings that are impacted by the cost increases. Those kick in gradually with slightly different approaches and timing from business to business. Overall, our outlook is that the top line price increases in the second half will offset most, but not all of the cost increase, but it will be reasonably close for the full year.
Operator: We have our next question from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
ColinRusch: Could you give us a bit more detail on the bundled offerings, the scope of those customers, the potential for follow-ons anything around the individual end markets that are really leading the way? I just want to get a sense of where that traction is, and how it might accelerate?
RobPainter: Colin, it's Rob. So we work backwards from the Connect & Scale strategy and the platform strategy. And we think about the bundled offerings and how they can be in service of delivering a greater value proposition to our customers. The primary places where we're seeing the fruits of -- the early fruits of the efforts are in Construction and to a lesser extent in Transportation. And we are measuring that success or we'll measure cross-sell ACV internally, and we'll measure new logos for proof points that we're creating success. And we're listening to our customers. And our customers are telling us that this is how they want to do business with us and that they want to see us connect to many of the point solutions that we have together to provide really workflow productivity. So I'm quite encouraged that we're heading in the right direction here with Connect & Scale, and I'm encouraged that its potential really across a great deal of our portfolio.
ColinRusch: Okay. That's helpful. And then we'd love to get a better sense of this Infrastructure Bill that just is getting released with over $100 billion in -- might earmark for the roads and bridges. How that potentially is different for Trimble versus past bills? And what you're expecting given kind of the first read on what's in there?
RobPainter:
Operator: We have our next question from Chad Dillard from Bernstein.
ChadDillard: So I wanted to dig into the Agriculture investment that you talked about that you're increasing. Can you just give a little more color on that? And could you just rank order what the priorities are for that business right now?
RobPainter: So when we look at the Agriculture business and think about the priority investments, our leadership for going on decades now has been in the guidance side of the business. So think of the controls and guidance. We will continue to invest in that business to keep us as the leader in guidance technology. So we're increasing our level of investment there. And think positioning technologies, think about ubiquity of coverage around the world with the positioning or correction services we have, the fast convergence that we can provide to farmers to get that high level accuracy. Think about position under canopy to provide better outcomes for farmers for positioning. So we will continue to invest in the guidance side of the business.  If I move next to the Precision side of the business, I think flow controls variable rate, which we see as the next really growth frontier within the agriculture market. We've been investing in this for a long time. The Mueller acquisition we did a few years ago really brought us forward into this space, and we continue to see attractive opportunities there. And then the 2 other areas I would put would be autonomy. And our autonomy efforts we are developing really in the core part of Trimble that serves construction end markets and agriculture end markets. So we could eliminate redundancy and duplication of efforts by serving multiple markets. So efforts in autonomy are important to us. And by way of example, the HORSCH relationship that was announced as it puts credibility behind the efforts we have there. And then finally, I would look at the software side of the Agriculture business and the bundling. It's more than just a bundling. But if we look at the software capabilities within agriculture, it's really that operational dashboard, an operational management system for a farm, and we believe deeply in the connection of what we're doing in the office and the field, the software to hardware to physical to digital, making it easier for the farmers to buy the software, the services and the hardware together. So there's efforts in that front.
ChadDillard: That's helpful. And then can you just help me think through the incremental margins in the back half of the year? Am I very rough back of the envelope math, it sounds like it could be a little bit negative. So can you just walk through just the puts and takes on net price, quantifying materials, logistics cost? And then just like how quickly do you think you can raise price and push that through to your customers?
DavidBarnes: Chad, it's David. Let me offer a few observations. So as you think about the dynamics in the back half, it's safe to say that the cost impact will hit faster than our price increases. So I said we would offset most, but not all of the cost increase with pricing in the back half. And just the logic of that says gross margins will be under more pressure in Q3 and Q4. Another dynamic impacting the gross margin line is the mix of the business. We saw a pretty big spike up with 47% Hardware growth, which comes in at lower gross margins, and that will abate it a bit. So that -- those are the key drivers on the gross margin line. OpEx is going up for the reasons that Rob mentioned and a few others. In part, we're restoring normalcy to compensation base and bonus compensation. We're really, really unusually low last year, and we're hitting our targets this year. So that accounts for about half of the OpEx increase that we expect. And the remainder is a function of the investments Rob mentioned and other costs that go up as our revenue grows.  We -- margins will be impacted -- have been impacted and will be impacted by the subscription transition. It will be a little more than 150 basis points in the back half of the year. So all of that complicated math gets you to a point where we now think operating margins for the full year will be roughly comparable to 2020. And you might recall, last time we said they would be between '19 and '20. But with the bigger revenue than we anticipated last time we're getting more fixed cost leverage. So hopefully, that points you to most of the items you need.
Operator: We have our next question from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.
ErikLapinski: This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe if we could just dive a bit into the bounce back you're seeing in your perpetual software business. I'm wondering if any of the strength or some of those products are tied to hardware products? And if so, to that point, could there be some headwinds to that business if hardware is seeing supply chain bottlenecks?
DavidBarnes: Erik, it's David. You're right. The meaningful majority of our perpetual software is sold together with hardware. So that's been a good news story. We do, by the way, continue to anticipate that hardware revenue will grow just year-on-year, just not as much as it did in the second quarter, and we do anticipate lower sequential revenue in the back half versus the front half. So that will have a direct correlating impact on perpetual software.
ErikLapinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could squeeze in another one. As we think about some of the perpetual sales coming back, and I know, ultimately, longer term the goal is to convert as much of the portfolio to subscription as possible. Is there a strategy around some of these products that are still sold on a perpetual basis? Or do they kind of fall in the category of the likely continue to be purchased on a perpetual basis?
RobPainter: Erik, this is Rob. I'll give you an example on our Civil Construction business. We have an offering we call Trimble Platform-as-a-Service, where you can get a technology assurance by subscribing to the machine control and guidance solution. And when we sell that, that sells with software that comes along with it and actually a richer software offering also can bundle some office software with that. We have examples, and a few they're not needle movers, but some examples in agriculture, where some of the large enterprise farms are buying what we refer to as everything as a service. So we do have examples in the business where -- call them, whether it's a onetime sale or what would look like perpetual can become ratable with it. And it works -- so we believe it works so long as you're providing a compelling value proposition and the root of that compelling value proposition and construction is around technology assurance. So we will continue to push that forward. We've been really in North America in Civil Construction, and that will now start to go out to more of a global model. And then if we look at the software that goes along with the hardware that you were just asking about, we also see opportunities that even for hardware that continues to sell as a onetime sale that those -- that perpetual software that goes along with it, much of that does, we think have an opportunity to go ratable over time. It could be a --
ErikLapinski: It's very helpful. Congrats on the quarter.
RobPainter: Thanks, Erik.
Operator: We have our next question from Gal Munda from Berenberg.
GalMunda: The first one was just maybe touch a little bit on the dynamics of the bookings growth versus the ARR growth. When I look at your split and the commentary around different segment results, both in Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation, you're noting that bookings are actually growing faster than ARR. What's driving the dynamic? Is it kind of maybe in Transportation still the churn that's kind of leaking out there? Or is it duration? Or is it just the fact that it's kind of more upfront licenses that's kind of providing the bookings growth ahead of the ARR?
RobPainter: Gal, it's Rob. The bookings growth ahead of ARR growth, actually, I see is very virtuous in the business. And the bookings is, of course, going to precede ARR. So I look at the bookings growth that we're having as proof points that the strategy is working, both the strategy for individual products we have, proof points that the macros are there, the fundamentals are there for the underlying businesses, proof points that the bundling efforts are working. Proof points that we're driving new logo growth. Proof points as well, Gal, I'll give you a specific example.  When we see -- we keep seeing when we have models that transition from perpetual to subscription that we're increasing the size of the addressable market. So our architecture and design business, for example, had yet another quarter of over 50% ARR growth. That's 6 quarters in a row. That doesn't happen unless you are expanding the size of the addressable market. Those growth rates exceed what we had before the model conversion. So that's going to show up in a booking growth before it shows up in ARR, that's exactly how I would want to see this play out in the business. So I'm very encouraged by seeing that dynamic.
GalMunda: Okay. Perfect. So that there is the upside to the ARR growth effectively in the --
RobPainter: Exactly.
GalMunda: That's good.
RobPainter: The timing of when that bookings growth translates into the ARR. So you connected the dots correctly.
GalMunda: Yes. Absolutely. Okay. That makes sense. And then last quarter, when we talked a little bit about the supply chain issues and the headwind to the growth, I think we're saying the reason why you didn't raise the guidance more last quarter was because of that. Is there -- now you've obviously raised the guidance quite significantly after the first half. How much is this still kind of providing, how much is it putting breaks on your growth? Or how much could you grow if supply wasn't an issue but kind of demand would allow you to grow faster than you think you are. Can you quantify that still?
DavidBarnes: Gal, it's David. Let me start with a couple of perspectives. Demand was more robust in Q2 than we thought a quarter ago. We also were able to squeeze more out of the supply chain than we thought we would a quarter ago. I'd point you to the comments we made about our hardware backlog. So in a normal year, hardware backlog at the end of Q2 would be about $100 million. That's what we had a year ago. We actually saw it creep up as the supply chain issues began to show themselves in Q1. It was about $200 million. Now we're at $300 million. So the simple way to think about it is that an awful lot of that $300 million or the $200 million increment above a normal level is what customers want that our supply chain isn't letting us get to them. And I'd love to say we're going to get through all of that in the back half of the year. But if you look through the guidance comments, you'll note that we're projecting that we think we'll end the year with backlog somewhere about where it is now. So we're -- our lead times on some products are longer than we or our customers would like, and we're working through it. But it's a interesting situation. We're not unique in facing these challenges. We've worked through it much better than we thought, but it will be -- it will constrain the growth we otherwise could have in the back half.
Operator: We have our next question from Rob Mason from Baird.
RobMason: First question was just around your operating expenses. You had noted as you go into the back half of the year, the second half, 150 to 200 basis points around your growth investments as those are increasing. Would -- should we think that those are still scaling up as we exit the year and presumably, those will carry over into next year? That's one question. And then relatedly, just around your compensation normalizing after the measures you took last year. I'm just curious if there's anything around the incentive side that we should think about perhaps resetting or resetting at a different level, lower level next year as well?
DavidBarnes: Yes. Rob, it's David. Let me frame this a little bit. If you sort of go through the outlook we gave on gross margins and operating margins, you'll see that we expect for the year operating expense to be up about $130 million plus or minus for the year. About half of that is relating to restoring compensation to a normal level, and we are beating our own benchmarks. So that will improve -- that increases comp in a way that would likely normalize next year. The remainder of it is partly just the normal cost of growth and then about 20% or so of the $130 million is relating to the growth initiatives. I'll probably look to Rob for commentary, but I will say, I think using Rob's word, this is a long game, and we're engaged in a multiyear effort to create and exploit these platforms, the digital transformation where we have underway. The spending by no means will be over, that's not what we're signaling this year. We will be spending against those initiatives next year and thereafter.
RobMason: I see. Okay. Just maybe a follow-up. Around the Geospatial business, in particular, obviously, very strong rebound off last year. But kind of noticing that across the industry as well. And historically, I know, Rob, you've talked about that perhaps being the most penetrated vertical or area you sell into from a technology perspective. So I'm just curious if there's -- is there anything changing around the technology side? I know you yourselves have some new products there. But is there anything changing in the industry around the technology? Or is there possibly your customers or channel trying to get out in front of what may be coming from an infrastructure side?
RobPainter: Yes. Good question, Rob. I see 3 things happening in the market. I see the new product introduction. I see channel excellence, and I see positive macros. The team did an outstanding job in the quarter. They've done an outstanding job really over the last couple of years, couldn't be more proud of what this group of colleagues is doing because they are defying the messaging I've had in the past about the nature of growth potential in the market. And I'll follow the numbers that are published, we are outgrowing our competitors and peers in the market in this business. Now we'll eventually lap this and those numbers will get hard.  On the new product introduction side, I'd say a couple of things. Yes, we have been mentioning many of the products that the team and the cadence that they've had here over time. And that does, let's say, create a replacement cycle opportunities. So whether we're talking our X7 Laser Scanner, we've got a new mobile mapping system, there are -- our R2 GNSS system, the TSC5 handheld data collector, these are all driving excellent business. And this business was actually well positioned in context of supply chain constraints because when you have new products coming to market, you're buying components well ahead of that. So that's the new product introduction side.  The second on channel excellence, really kudos to the sales leadership and channel development team who works with our global dealer partners, all of them, I think, are becoming more and more professional in how they run and manage their businesses and how they think about segmenting markets and addressing opportunities. And then finally, the macros. Clearly, macro such as residential and infrastructure are driving very positive benefits for this business. We saw oil and gas do better in the quarter. So in places like Texas, they were buying. I'll say, they were buying again. So we saw some growth in that in the quarter as well. And we look at those macros, Rob, not only for the current sales of the surveying mapping products within Geospatial, but we look at the correlation of how that might connect to the civil construction products that would be downstream of that from a workflow perspective. And so that gives us conviction in and hope of an Infrastructure Bill getting passed that that is a sign, an early sign of potential in our other -- some of our other businesses.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over back to Michael Leyba of Investor Relations.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Trimble First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. On today's call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to Rob Painter, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.
Rob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2, with the key messages we want to convey today. In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.32 billion, up 9% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 12%, EBITDA of 26%, and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $745 million. Our results demonstrate the quality of our business model and an improving macro-economic backdrop. They also highlight the strength of our Connect and Scale 2025strategy. On the basis of this competitive strength and the nature of the opportunities we see in the market, we plan to scale up investments in targeted areas of the company. At the same time, we are also raising our guidance for the year. Turning to Page 3, in the market backdrop, the common threat across the industries we serve is delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. The industries we serve our large, global, underserved and underpenetrated with technology. As our end market digitize, we are able to connect the office and the field with our hardware and our software offerings, in a manner that delivers productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. In buildings and infrastructure, we exceeded expectations in the business, leveraging our strong market position and continuing the conversion of our business models. The segment now stands at approximately 65% software-related revenue. In geospatial, the business experienced the strongest year-over-year growth we have seen, since we created a reporting segment in 2017. Global demand is healthy and the innovation that the team has delivered has strengthened our competitive position. In transportation, we met the P&L expectations we have for the segment in the quarter. Bookings in our mobility business improved to their best level since early 2019. Bookings in our transportation enterprise software business were strong, with subscription bookings more than double the level of our first quarter 2020. We remain confident that we will deliver demonstrable improvement in revenue, margins and ARR trends in the second-half of the year. In resources and utilities, the commodity price backdrop is providing global tailwinds to the business. And we delivered growth well ahead of our expectations. Let's turn next to Page 4, for some proof points on the Trimble operating system, capturing strategy, people and execution. On strategy, we continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities, particularly design and engineering software business announced its shift to subscription that went into effect in March. Different but better, is our tagline, and I think that sums it up well, which is to say, it's more than just change its progress. Our mechanical electrical plumbing business also continued its subscription conversion, and as mentioned, we saw a strong level of recurring bookings in our transportation enterprise business. Finally, I'd like to note that we closed the divestiture of the Manhattan Real Estate Software business early in the second quarter, and we wish the team well in its new home. On people, I'm pleased to report that we ranked number 15 out of 15,000 companies in 2021 Best Global Culture survey. I also want to announce that our CTO, Tom Fansler, retires at the end of the second quarter. Two of our other business leaders, Ron and Patty and Bryn Fosburgh will assume new role starting in the third quarter. Ron will operate as an entrepreneur and residents, driving innovation efforts. And Brent will act as our Interim CTO. I'm pleased to say that we promoted from within for Ron and Brent's current responsibilities for the e-Builder and overall construction businesses, respectively. On execution, we released our sustainability report a few weeks ago. I'm incredibly proud of the work of the team on this important initiative. Our teams also continue to innovate. We launched the civil construction estimating software package, we released a combination of our LOADRITE payload management system with Earthworks Grade Control Platform. We launched a new TSC5 data controller [ph], and we released the new SX12 scanning total station, which is an update to our successful SX10 instrument. The SX12 now supports additional applications in tunneling and underground construction. With respect to increasing investment in the business, we see Connect and Scale as being synonymous with an industry platform strategy. We want to play offense and invest now for the mid- to long-term opportunities that we see in the market. We see a generational opportunity out of a North America infrastructure bill, and a strong commodity price backdrop in the agriculture market. We will invest in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure, and we'll step up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble cloud platform and our autonomy efforts. A quick update on our plans for an Investor Day, we have concluded that an in-person meeting at our Colorado facility, where much of our leadership team is based, is the best way to facilitate the kind of in-depth interaction that many of you want from an Investor Day. We will hold the meeting in the spring of 2022, by which time the environment for business travel should be greatly improved. We also plan to hold one or two interactive virtual sessions with investors on specific topics of broad interest later this year. In closing, I'm as confident and optimistic about Trimble as ever. We have the right team, pursuing a compelling strategy and attractive markets. It won't be easy, and it won't be linear, but nothing worth achieving is. David, over to you.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5, with a review of first quarter results. First Quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3%, and divestitures subtracted 1%, for a total organic revenue increase of 10%. Gross margin in the first quarter was 58.4%. Margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.1%, up 340 basis points, driven both by higher revenue and strong cost control. Operating income margins expanded 330 basis points to 23.6%. Net income dollars increased by 36%, and earnings per share increased by $0.17 to $0.66 per share. The first quarter cash flow from operations was $228 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $218 million. We paid down $158 million of debt in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3 times. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.2 5 billion available on our revolving credit facility, and approximately $265 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our non-recurring revenue streams also grew with hardware growing 17%, and perpetual software growing 11%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth also contributed to perpetual software growth, and some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 9%. Excluding transportation revenues in North America grew 15%. In Europe, revenues were up 16%, roughly half of our Europe growth was driven by currency, with the balance coming from catch-up on project activities slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures, and recovering demand in many end markets. Asia Pacific had the best performance in the quarter, up 17%, driven by strong growth in Australia and Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina was up 5% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue was $1.32 billion in the first quarter, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Organic ARR growth was approximately 7%. Excluding our transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Research and Development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue. Our deferred revenue grew 12% on a year-over-year basis. And our backlog excluding the impact of the real estate software business divested early in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year. While growing backlog is obviously an indicator of strong momentum in the business. I'll note here that backlog at quarter-end was unusually high, in part because Trimble like so many manufacturers in this recovering economy is experiencing shortages and extended delivery times, for many key components of our hardware products. Our operations team is hard at work to expedite delivery of products, which are in short supply, but we do expect to manage challenges with both cost inflation and extended lead times of select hardware product lines in the quarters to come. Turning now to Slide 8, for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and infrastructure revenue was up 13% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil construction businesses. Segment margins were up 760 basis points, due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 22% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment business. Margins were up 590 basis points due to strong revenue growth and cost control. Resources and utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis. We experienced double digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. Margins expanded 190 basis points driven by increased revenue and cost control. Top-line results in transportation were consistent with our expectations. Revenue was down 6% on an organic basis year-on-year, and margins declined 450 basis points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we have highlighted previously. Revenue and margins were roughly stable sequentially, when compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and leading indicators provide encouraging signs for the recovery ahead. As Rob mentioned, bookings were very strong in both our mobility and enterprise software businesses. Our product performance is improving, and our sales pipeline is stronger than it has been in nearly two years. We remain confident that we are on track to improve performance later this year. Moving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update to our outlook for the year. Given our outperformance in the first quarter, our growing backlog and increasing confidence in our business trends, we are raising our revenue forecast range by $100 million to $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. I'll note here that the biggest risk we have to our revenue outlook for the next couple of quarters is the supply environment for critical hardware components. We expect that revenue growth will be strongest in the second quarter, as we lap the worst period of the COVID lockdowns in 2020, with more moderate growth in the back-half of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect organic ARR growth in the high single digits with improving trends as the year progresses. From a profitability perspective, we continue to expect that EBITDA margins will come in between the levels of 2019 and 2020. Margins for the balance of 2021, and especially in the second-half of the year, are likely to come down from the levels we achieved in the first quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect some operating expense acceleration as the year progresses and the environment for business travel opens up. Second, we are accelerating investments that Rob mentioned earlier. These investments include spending on our digital transformation and cloud infrastructure, and higher R&D on our autonomy projects, and our agricultural product offerings. And third, we are seeing growing cost pressure in our hardware costs of goods, across a broad range of commodities. We are adapting our pricing and discounting strategies to reflect these cost pressures, but still anticipate some adverse impact on our gross margins. We continue to expect that software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring will impact revenue growth and operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Our earnings per share outlook is raised to $2.30 to $2.50. This reflects the revenue and operating margin trends, I mentioned earlier, and a modestly higher tax rate outlook than we had anticipated a quarter ago. From a cash flow perspective, we spent cash flow from operations of approximately 1.1 times net income, with free cash flow exceeding net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ann Duignan: Yes. Could you provide some more color on your gross margins through the remainder of the year, and the impact of higher costs, whether those are just stem, the inability to get supply or, higher material costs going forward? Just would like to get a sense of what's more permanent versus what's temporary? And then could you dig a little deeper into your increased investments, particularly in agriculture? And, the digital et cetera, I think those are probably not surprising, but just dig a little bit deeper into both of those please. Thank you.
David Barnes: Hi, Ann, this is David. I'll take the first part of your question on gross margins. I'll say the environment for product cost has changed a lot, just in the last month or two. And it's a fluid situation, so it's hard to make specific predictions. I will say that the product inflation that we're facing really only began toward the end of Q1. So the results that we just reported don't reflect the full impact we anticipate later this year. And you saw our gross margins declined year-on-year about 70 basis points, and probably just under half of that can be accounted counted for in product cost increases. But we're seeing increases across the board. Obviously, we're all reading about semiconductor tight supply and cost increases, but we're really seeing it across a whole broad range of commodities, in transportation, particularly air transportation that we use to get our products where we need them to go. So, without getting too specific, I'll say that we do expect underlying cost of goods inflation for the balance of the year to be noticeably higher than it was in Q1. Now, I'll comment that we're adapting, as I mentioned in the script, our discounting strategy and our top-line prices, and we hope to accommodate a meaningful portion of the impact of the costs increases, but nonetheless, we expect gross margins will come down for that reason, in the remaining three quarters of the year. And then, I'll turn over to Rob for your questions about operating expense and the investments we’re making.
Rob Painter: Hi, Ann. So, I mentioned that Connect and Scale specific strategy is synonymous with the platform strategy and the nucleus, an agriculture market for us is the crop production workflow. So the stepped up investments we're making in agriculture hit areas of that platform that include autonomy, includes our software, includes our correction services, and continuing to build out the networks around that. And then finally, localization efforts, it is the majority of our business these days is outside North America.
Ann Duignan: Okay. And just quickly to follow-up, how much demand is there really, for the connected farm for the entire software package across the entire enterprise? I think, of farmers as wanting individual packages from different suppliers. And so, I'm just curious, what you're seeing out there in the marketplace from a connected farm perspective?
David Barnes: Our technology is on over 150 million acres of farm today, that's primarily the hardware, the guidance systems. We have about 20% of that same acreage covered with our software. So, it's not -- this isn't new, let's say it's been in motion for a long time. I see the delta of the 80% is a potentially addressable market, obviously, we won't serve 100% of that. The other way to look at it, Ann, that's a software hardware connection. The other way to look at it as from a correction services perspective. So we have well over 100,000 users of our correction services today. And the connected farm that is an aspect. So when the scale part of Connect and Scale is about making ourselves easier to do business with, and bringing that software, the hardware and the services together at the point of sale. So, we think there is a demand for a market.
Ann Duignan: Okay, I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good afternoon. You know, it's funny, Rob, you actually touched on what I wanted to ask about in your prepared remarks, and David did too. It seems like with infrastructure bill coming down the channels, we get a lot of questions just on what that'll mean, it seems like a bit of a potential coming out party for all the transformation the industry can do with digital construction. So, I'd just love to hear any stories or any color you have on how you're preparing the organization to see themselves, what your capabilities are versus what we all kind of know, a couple of years ago? How you see that opportunity to really showcase what can be done for construction with what you have? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Rob. So, we see it as a generational opportunity. And I'll focus on North America, but highlight that places like the UK are going with construction led recovery. We see markets like Japan promoting digital technologies. Australia has strong infrastructure development as well. In North America, I think about it from the value proposition of what the technology can do. We think about the funding around that. And we mentioned that we would -- with respect to our own funding, we would step up investments in the area, and then we also think about policy. So from a value proposition perspective, with digital technology, we can build greener, we can build more inclusively, and we can build better while doing so cheaper. So it just makes sense to use the technology. What we're hearing from customers and stakeholders in the industry actually is on the policy side as well as a desire to streamline project delivery, by promoting the digital technology. So really streamlining project delivery, really seems to be the core of what the market is talking about. And from a funding perspective, I'll start with government level funding. And, we do anticipate that the final amount will be well-negotiated, and it'll be different than the proposed American jobs plan. Nevertheless, and we need to also reauthorize the surface transportation bill. So the jobs plan, in addition to the reauthorization of the surface transportation bill, we think that will be significant. We think it will be incremental to the current baseline investments in our highways, airports, mass transit, and our ports. Now, we think that won't pass until later in the year. And the benefits of that wouldn't be realized in 2022. So when we think about the investments in our business to get ahead of that, we think both at a product development level, as well as a go-to-market level. So at a product development level, where we're going with the Connect part of Connect and Scale, as integrating the hardware, the software, the physical, the digital, the office, the field, being able to round trip that data to streamline project delivery. So, we'll continue our efforts on that front. And at a go-to-market level, it's putting the resources, increase the level of resources and capabilities in place to actually execute against what we think is attractive and important opportunity.
Rob Wertheimer: That's a great answer. Thank you. And just to highlight one thing you mentioned in there, do you feel like the customer is now well educated and calling for this kind of product in a way that was different from a year ago, or five years ago? Has that changed significantly? And I will stop there. Thank you.
Rob Painter: It is changing significantly, I'd say we may not be at the point of calling it significant, it's certainly meaningful amount of change. And I think about it from a few dynamics, I'll address owners, engineers and contractors. At an owner level, think about the Department of Transportation as an owner to talk about a state DoT as an owner. I do think there's increasing awareness of the technology. They're certainly increasing awareness of the concept of the digital twin, and how this can play through the operations and maintenance phase. And if we use the technology during the design, engineering and construction phase, how that can then be leveraged in the operations and maintenance phase. So I think there is increased awareness. We see a few more projects that are promoting the use of technology. Actually, the Federal Highway Administration, they made an announcement recently to recognize as a digitalize belt [ph] is an important technology innovation. So that's helpful to see that coming from that perspective. In the engineering community, certainly, it's in the interest of the engineering community to help fill the delivery of the projects better and faster, and for them to be able to win more of the work. And then at the contractor level, I see that's where we see the most level of proactive use and request for use of technology, because the contractors are the ones who are -- they're really seeing the most tactical benefit of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener, in their day to day work. So they're winning more work. It's becoming more just the way that construction is done. So very positive on the contractor side.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Ashok Sivamohan: Hi, this is Ashok Sivamohan on for Jerry Revich. You said that buildings and infrastructure margins expanded due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. And so, I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sustainability of buildings and infrastructure margins at these levels?
David Barnes: Ashok, it's David. We have a meaningful hardware business in buildings and infrastructure, so that will be impacted by the hardware dynamics, I discussed previously. And I also mentioned that overall for the company, we expect to see some operating expense pickup. I'll call some of it natural, because with COVID we had almost no business travel, we had lower incentive compensation. So that will normalize. And then the investments that we're making will be seen in the segments broadly. So those dynamics are going to put pressure on margins in all the segments, including buildings and infrastructure.
Ashok Sivamohan: Great. And in terms of the 11% growth and perpetual software revenue this quarter, I'm wondering if you can discuss which products drove the growth and our prospects for that growth to potentially continue?
David Barnes: I'll say one thing, as I mentioned in my remarks, we sell a meaningful amount of perpetual software bundled with the hardware. So, when hardware grows like it did in the first quarter perpetual software grows. We are in the process of transitioning from perpetual to subscription, Rob mentioned in one of our design software offerings, and that sort of tends to precipitate perpetual software growth. So that was a piece of it. But, overall, let's remember we're comparing with the first quarter of last year when we saw particularly toward the end of the quarter, a lot of hesitancy and great uncertainty. So customers were starting to be reluctant to buy. And I think all those factors contributed to perpetual software growth.
Ashok Sivamohan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Chad Dillard: Hi, good afternoon, guys. So, I want to dig in to your guidance change on the revenue side, just hoping to get a little bit more color on the moving parts planned out from an end market perspective, as well as a regional perspective. And then also, if I look at statistical seasonality, like you usually imply like a $4 billion revenue number for the year. So I just wanted to understand, is that delta really all about the supply chain issues? Or is there something else?
David Barnes: Yeah. Hey, Chad, this is David. I'll say first of all, that comparing quarter-to-quarter last year is a tough drill, because last year was so strange. And particularly as we recall Q2, we saw a rapid contraction in demand, and many of that are end markets, and then a lot of catch-up and pick up later in the year. So that's going to factor in. As far as the end markets that are driving the results, we mentioned in transportation, we ended about where we thought we would P&L wise, but bookings were up, and obviously the transportation market has picked up in terms of the macros with asset utilization and pricing and the financial solidity of our transportation customers is better. So, that's more of a tailwind for future quarters than this one. But, look beyond that, in the other three segments, we exceeded our expectations. So that's why the outlook came up in part, because Q1 was above where we thought it would be. And we think some of those trends will continue. And the caution I'll provide is that hardware still a meaningful part of our business. And for all the reasons I mentioned, with the supply chain challenges, that's creating the greatest level of uncertainty. So I don't know if that answers your questions about seasonality. We do think seasonality will be different in 2021 from 2020, for a number of reasons. And you're probably better off comparing with 2019 for a normalized year.
Chad Dillard: Got it. That's helpful. And just a question on gross margins and price costs. Just to be clear, will you be exiting the year -- will you be able to match your price with this cost? And then, you can just talk about just your ability to raise price in terms of a contractual dynamic fair as well?
David Barnes: Yeah, I'll say it's a very complicated formula. We have contractual arrangements with our customers and dealers that don't facilitate an immediate increase in price in some cases. So that's a factor. With some protection of supply chain side too, but those don't necessarily match up. So, I think for Trimble and every company producing hardware, this is a rapidly moving situation. Our intention, obviously, we will remain competitive. Our intention is to recoup a meaningful portion of the increase in product costs. And I'll say, we can't have a specific estimate with high confidence in that cost. But we believe we'll get a meaningful chunk, but not all of it. And that's why we expect to see some gross margin declines, or continuing decline for the remainder of the year.
Rob Painter: And this is Rob. To add to that, as we exit the year, I think the exit path would…
David Barnes: That's right. I think if you look at what's happening in the world, the semiconductor side of things is going to take probably three or four, maybe five quarters to recover. Some of the other input costs are likely to abate sooner than that. For instance, air freight will get more reasonable once trans-oceanic aircraft recovers. So there are a lot of moving pieces. I don't think this is a long-term change in the trajectory of our gross margins. But, it will be with us for a few quarters.
Chad Dillard: Great. That's helpful. I'll get back into the queue. Thank you.
Operator: Next question from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Kristen on for Collin. Thank you for taking our questions.
Rob Painter: Sure.
Unidentified Analyst: So nice to see some improvement in the backlog in transportation. We are obviously in a tight freight environment where carriers are making money, but also needing to bolster their ability to keep up with demand and some of the labor shortages. If we look through the noise, can you talk about some of the underlying trends in that business, as it relates to your portfolio? And how we should think about a more normalized business trend into 2022, as we comp some of these unique headwinds?
David Barnes: Kristen, I'll just point out the obvious that some of the factors that have been driving our trends are somewhat unique to Trimble, in terms of the issues we had, post the ELD mandate coming into effect. And we did have some product performance issues. And so, the pullback in ARR was a consequence of that. There's no doubt that the macros in the transportation business are dramatically better than they were three to four quarters ago, and that's helpful. Our business trends won't change linearly and right away with the changes in the macro environment, with the customers that we serve experience. So it's not at all surprising to any of us that we have some lag. But, I'll say there are a number of factors that give us confidence that we're on the road back to better trends and transportation, just to highlight a few. Our churn is trending down on a secular basis, there are bumps quarter-to-quarter as individual customers implement decisions they made some time ago. But, the data truly points to a better trend there. Rob mentioned the bookings, even beyond the bookings, our sales pipeline is looking up versus where it was a quarter or two ago. The performance of our products is improving. So our teams have done a great job of resolving the product issues. And I think we're seeing broader customer receptivity through the strategy of the integrated supply chain. So we have a lot of work to do in transportation, Kristen, so we're not changing the outlook, that things will get better immediately. But, we do look to see improve trends toward the back-half of the year, and especially the fourth quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful color. Thank you. And then, if I could ask a longer-term question, maybe dovetailing on a question that was asked earlier. I wanted to ask about your appetite for M&A at this stage. Historically, we think about a few points contribution every year to revenue growth. Balance Sheet is in great shape, because you're generating a ton of cash flow. But, as you're thinking about planning for these generational opportunities in infrastructure and ag, as you called out, can you talk about the M&A pipeline? Are there opportunities for more sizable investments? And maybe what's on the Trimble wish list?
Rob Painter: The short answer, Kristen is yes, that the pipeline is more active at the moment. And, certainly our areas of interest are going to be where we have the most strategic opportunity to grow and to build a platform strategy, whether that's in a construction, agriculture, or in some of our other vertical focused market. So that we feel pretty good about where we are. And as you said, the balance sheet is in a great place to be able to help us facilitate that.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: And your next question from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, team, this is Eric on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe if we can touch more on the demand impacts of the supply chain issues you're seeing? Are you seeing any element of forward ordering and maybe that was captured in your comments around the backlog earlier? Or even just buying ahead of potential supply chain constraints in any areas of the business? Or is visibility, I guess improved would be another way to say that?
David Barnes: Hey, Eric. I'll say it's a little hard to quantify when orders come through exactly whether they're for current demand or they're seeing the supply chain tighten up. I think it's a mixture of both. Our backlog, I mentioned is now up to $1.4 billion, a meaningful increase year-on-year. I'd say the increase year-on-year for the hardware piece is a mix of healthy demand and end markets, and some customers ordering before they otherwise would have. But I'll say inventory at our dealers is really low. And I think most of what you're seeing is the fact that the end markets are really healthy. And projects are picking up and customers need the product.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's extremely helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just touching on geospatial, it continues to be very strong and definitely benefiting from the construction, the recovery you guys have mentioned. How much of an element though I know you've had some product releases and refreshes. Do you I guess attribute to maybe some of that refresh cycle versus the broader macro demand?
Rob Painter: This is Rob. There's absolutely an aspect that correlates to the replacement cycle and new products that we have, whether that's on the handheld side with TSC5, or on the GNSS receiver side with our 12I. Those would be replacement examples where we're able to bring in a new instrument or tool, that's able to make the customers more productive. We've got a tighter integration of our software workflows into the hardware. So we've seen customers who are orienting their field survey crews around a Trimble workflow. So it's almost like the tail wagging the dog, where that software is driving the demand for the hardware. There's also examples of our, I'd call them new categories. So take our laser scanner, 3D laser scanner, it's an instrument called the X7. That's a market segment where we didn't historically drive as much business. So that's not a replacement market for us. That's new-new. And then I would say on the go-to-market side, the team's done an excellent job on a global distribution basis of getting our dealers in a better healthier states, and really understanding their own local go-to-market execution. So definitely a mix of both. And really, the team's done great work.
Unidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: Next question from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Just a question around the OpEx number the $308 million number in the quarter. Could you just maybe speak to the cadence of what OpEx looks like as we move through the second through the fourth quarter? I mean, we've got some puts and takes, obviously, but trying to get a sense of how much the COVID-related expenses, or penalties, I guess how you want to call it, come back into the number? You spoke a little bit around investments there. Maybe just define that a little bit. But, that's what I'm trying to look for a little bit of guidance as to how that number plays out for the next few quarters.
David Barnes: Hey, Richard its David. First thing I'll say is that in terms of what I'll call costs generated by COVID, we didn't have much. The impact of COVID on our costs was really negative. We had some costs in our cleaning our facilities and that kind of thing, but it was relatively de minimis. So we had sort of artificially low costs in a number of areas. With the revenue coming down, our incentive comp naturally reduced. We stopped traveling canceled events. And we really cut back on a lot of discretionary spending, that wasn't core to the strategy. So that's coming back. And as you look at the operating expense growth going forward, I'll put it in a handful of buckets. First of all, some of our OpEx is overseas and the U.S. dollar is weakened. So just the FX impact sort of takes up our accounts for about 20% of our OpEx increase that we expect for the balance of the year. But 60% of the increase is what I'll call go back to normal, as travel comes back, as incentive comp comes back, as we start hiring. We didn't even have our salary increase last year. So that's the normal part of things. And then about 20%, the remaining 20% of the year-on-year OpEx increase will be accounted for in higher spending in the investment areas that Rob mentioned. There a couple other things that are puts in takes, you've got some other headcount, ads and divestitures. But, hopefully that gives you a broad bucketing. And we do think year-on-year OpEx, which was about flat in Q1, it won't be flat in the remaining quarters.
Richard Eastman: Okay. It can't be. Okay. And then Rob, maybe you could just shed some color on the BIM piece of buildings and infrastructure, either geographically or perhaps by end market. In other words, as the commercial market look firm to up versus education market, government market, it'd be just to sift through that just a little bit as to where the strength was and should continue to be?
Rob Painter: Sure. So infrastructure and residential backlogs are solid. Healthcare, data centers, logistics centers, utility and fiber optics work, that's all good. And you can look at entities such as ABI and Dodge, and they're up. We look at OEM units, those have been pretty good from both the construction and agriculture side, even mining in places like South Africa and Australia, where we have some exposure of those have been good. So that, call it that general commercial work office buildings, that's low. Education, it's actually much bigger market than one might realize. And so it's still lower, but it's still a large number. And so that's doing okay. Geographically speaking, actually, it's a pretty broad based strength. So, Japan was strong, Australia, strong. North America, strong. Western Europe, and the Nordics are strong. And we see a play through both in software, and I guess we've given you some software answer, but we see it playing through in hardware. So for instance, when residential work picks up, we don't actually have as much exposure in residential on the building software side, but it helps us on the civil side and it helps us on the geospatial business. In civil construction, we see more of the smaller building construction product type equipment. If some of that equipments using technology or concrete screens for foundation work, I mean, geospatial it's survey work. So yeah, that's what's going on.
Richard Eastman: Yeah. In the 13% core growth for buildings and infrastructure, how much headwind was absorbed there from the SAS conversions and the growth rate there in that segment?
David Barnes: Good chunk.
Rob Painter: Probably a couple points.
David Barnes: Yeah.
Richard Eastman: Okay, couple. Okay, great. Thank you. And nice start to the year for sure.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Next question from Gal Munda of Berenberg. Your line is now open.
Gal Munda: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one that is just around the guidance for the rest of the year and the way you're thinking about, just to expand on the shortages issue. David, you mentioned that you expect semi shortage, for example, to take three to five quarters to really play out.  Is there a way where you kind of factored in a level of conservatism into your guidance for the rest of the year at this stage? Because you don't know whether, the supply can actually be met sorry, demand can be met with the supply that's available? And is there any sort of conservatism coming from that side? Or you don't think that's going to be an issue in meeting the demand?
David Barnes: It will definitely, I think, be a constraint. And as you think about the $100 million dollar range between the bottom and the top end of the revenue guidance, the uncertainties around hardware supply account for majority of that. So, I think the scenario in which we're at the lower end of the guidance range is characterized by increasing tightness in markets for key components. And the higher end is one in which, we're able to work through the constraints. So it is a hard one to call. It's somewhat unprecedented, talking to my colleagues who've been doing this work for decades, and none of them have seen anything just like it. So we have a very adept operations team. It's one of the strengths of Trimble of being flexible and figuring out how to handle bumps in the road, like we have now. So, we're looking at this component by component and product by product, and I'll concede that there's meaningful uncertainty, and that's what's driving the range in our guidance.
Gal Munda: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just as a second question, I'd like to spend a little bit on the guidance that you're still providing, in terms of the business model transition, which at this stage is still around 1.5 percentage points headwind to your growth. If we look kind of forward and maybe into '22, '23, like, how long does this persist for you? And how material it is going forward as well? Is there a way to think that maybe '22 and then '23, incrementally becomes less of a headwind but still is a headwind? Is that the right way to think about it?
David Barnes: Yeah, there's two ways I think about it, Gal. And where it would be less of a headwind is that a bit of a law of large numbers of 1.3, whatever $1.3 billion of ARR, that'll overcome if they had headwind. And we still have over $400 million on a TTM basis for perpetual software. So there are still available businesses for us to think about, some of which we are actively working on and some of which we're not. And we want to just see how things go and what will make really sense for the business. And so in that sense, you're right, it will be less of a headwind. The other side of it is as we look at other business models, so say, for example, hardware, and they take in the machine control guidance business, where we offer, we call it Trimble platform as a service. So they are cab technology assurance. By buying the machine control technology, we're bundling that with the software, that allows us to connect that physical digital field and the office. And if we're successful in driving that conversion, that may show up is more term type revenue, depends on the accounting works. But it could create some more ratability. And if it does, in that case, that could provide a headwind instead of the tailwind that I just described.
Gal Munda: That's interesting. And just to check, you said, that could happen on the machine control and guidance. Would it be potentially something that you consider in transportation as well? Some of the competitors kind of going down that route, is that something that even an ELD side could work?
David Barnes: Yeah. And we're largely already offering that today, bundling the hardware and the software together and that monthly service. The nature of how some of the accounting works, is it requires you to recognize the hardware revenue upfront, but you may ratably have the cash flow, depending on how the contracts are structured. I'll give you an example on really around our survey business. We've used it with a couple of customers to do a competitive swap on a fleet of equipment, by experimenting with the ratable business model. We've got one of our larger agriculture customers that's doing everything as a service arrangement with us. But those are small pockets and anecdotal examples. But just want to show and demonstrate that we're not just talking about experimenting with all our business models, we're actually doing it.
Gal Munda: Awesome. Thank you so much, and congrats for great results.
David Barnes: Thanks, Gal.
Operator: And the last question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.
Jason Celino: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Good segue, but to Gal's question on the pace of the transition, or transitions. In software, we've seen a few strategies for incentivizing customers to move to these new pricing offerings. Maybe you could categorize these as a carrot, and not a stick, Rob, maybe could you speak to how you guys are doing there?
Rob Painter: Yeah. Hi, Jason, this is Rob, I'll start. It's more of a carrot than a stick. So, our belief is that we can create more customer goodwill with the approach of the carrot. And so, the carrot that we can offer, I'll use that machine control example. The fundamental value proposition around technology assurance, so staying current on the sensors, staying current actually, on the firmware, that embedded software. You'd be surprised at how many customers can have outdated versions of the firmware. And when we can have a deeper insight to actually into the customer and help and drive customer success, I believe that's giving them a better value proposition and better ROI on their investment. The classic one, as you know, as we move from perpetual to subscription is to move IT operations off center for a customer, and that's providing them a value proposition that I would characterize as a carrot. And then one more I would mention, Jason, is I think a smart -- we think a smart way to do to provide the carrot is to increase the I'll call it increase the value of the offering when you move to the subscription. So in some cases, we're offering both the perpetual and the subscription offering. However, when you buy the subscription offering, you're getting a richer set of functionality and will start to only develop additional functionality in the cloud, because you have to make that break at some point. And we think by providing the better value offering that that is consistent with the carrot approach, as opposed to the stick. Now, that doesn't mean that we'll do both offerings forever. At some point, you do have to wind it down. But, thus far, we've given ample time to our customers to consider their own choices.
Jason Celino: Okay. So, similar question then, for your sales force and your partners, are you running any incentives to influence them to go for the subscription offerings?
Rob Painter: Yeah, follow the money. I mean, it's amazing what you can see if you change our own sales compensation to selling the perpetual versus the subscription, when we make it more attractive to sell the subscription offering the results correlate. No question. And at the dealer partner level, many times we'll use our balance sheet to make them whole at a cash level, because they may be running their businesses more on cash flow. And in that sense, you don't want to provide, at least initially, you don't necessarily want to provide a negative incentive to that. So yeah, you have to connect the go-to-market efforts, absolutely to the product strategy.
Jason Celino: Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thank you, Jason.
David Barnes: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand it over to Mr. Michael Leyba.
Michael Leyba: Thank you very much for joining us on the call, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-10 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and 2020 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now, I would like to turn it over to Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble. 
Rob Painter: Hello everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th week in the fourth quarter. Let’s start on Slide 2 with the three key messages we want to convey today. First, the customer ROI of our technology and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter. Our customer value proposition is rooted in productivity, quality, safety, visibility, and sustainability. We are pleased to announce that annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 0.4% year-over-year to $830 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, and we finished the year delivering a record $672 million of operating cash flow. Second, executing the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders across industry lifecycles and to transform customer workflows, while simultaneously making ourselves easier to do business with. As leaders of the business, we take our responsibility seriously to be effective allocators of capital. To this end, we will continue to invest disproportionately in our cloud and autonomy capabilities, as well as in go-to-market efforts to support and enable our long-term growth opportunities. Third, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We believe the secular trends of digitization provide long-term tailwinds and we maintain our resolve to exit this crisis on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it. As we come into 2021, we are both cautious and humble to recognize market uncertainty and volatility, while also confident that we are on the right track. Comparisons against 2020, especially on a quarterly basis, will be difficult, if not irrelevant. We will reinstate guidance at an annual level, and David will walk you through the details. In addition, we anticipate hosting an Investor Day in the second half of the year to update stakeholders on our long-term strategy and business model. As I reflect back on our May 2018 Investor Day and put that into context of our fiscal year 2020, while revenue is clearly set back with the pandemic, we are ahead in most all other aspects. At the Investor Day, we targeted adjusted 2021 EBITDA at 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2020 at 25.3% EBITDA. We targeted 2021 software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2020 at 58% of total revenue. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1 times. We closed 2020 at 1.2 times operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income. In July 2018, our net-debt-to-EBITA ratio stood above 3 times and we said we would de-lever below 2.5 times. Today, we stand at 1.6 times. We see these as important proof points that we are on the right strategic path that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds to deliver value to our customers and that our asset light business model works. Turning to my commentary on the fourth quarter, we beat our own expectations in Buildings & Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities. We hit our expectations in Transportation. Broadly speaking, we have seen signs of an emerging construction led recovery. We are experiencing favorable market conditions in agriculture. We see our innovation and go-to-market execution driving positive outcomes, and at the end of the year we benefited from government stimulus measures along with customers catching up on work.  David will walk us through additional segment details. Turning to Slide 3, this shows Connect & Scale delivering customer ROI in Transportation and Agriculture. In Transportation, our Trimble Dispatch Advisor solutions bring capabilities across our portfolio together to get the right load on the right truck with the right driver; thereby improving planning, reducing empty miles, and improving utilization. In Agriculture, Zlatiya Agro is a large farm enterprise in Bulgaria that has adopted Trimble's Connected Farm ecosystem across 100 of their machines. This offering consists of our GFX750 Connected display, and Autopilot steering along with our AutoSync data exchange functionality. The connected offering improves planning, process automation, and cost optimization. I will close my commentary on Slide 4 with an ESG update, a topic of increasing importance to all of our stakeholders. As a purpose-driven company, our mission of industry transformation and our leadership culture provides a compelling ESG backdrop. In the area of environmental sustainability, I'll highlight that the primary positive impact of Trimble on greenhouse gas emission reductions and other environmental measures happens through customer application of our technology. For example, eliminating rework in construction, reducing fuel and water usage in all our end-markets, and minimizing use of herbicides and pesticides in agriculture. We are also committed to developing science-based targets to further our positive impact. In the area of people and social responsibility, I’ll highlight that we ranked in the top 10% of companies for diversity in the Comparably survey. I’m also very proud of the work of the Trimble Foundation, where we contributed a record amount of money to put to work for our philanthropic efforts. Finally, in the area of corporate governance, our ratings with third-party firms like MSCI are strong, and we are committed to continuous improvement in our sustainability program. David, over to you.
David Barnes: Thanks Rob. Let’s begin on Slide 5, with a review of fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter total revenue was $830 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 0.4% year-over-year. To break that down, currency translation added 1% and acquisitions, net of divestitures, were essentially neutral. Organic growth, excluding the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2019, was approximately 2%. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue grew to $1.30 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year, and was up 7% on an organic basis. Organic ARR growth, excluding the Transportation segment was up 15%. Adjusted EBITDA, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was $217 million with a margin of 26.1%, reflecting both strong gross margins and continuing low operating costs. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16%, down 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net income was up 16% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.61, up 15% year-over-year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $188 million, up 54% year-over-year, while cash flow from operations for the full-year was $672 million, up 15% versus 2019. Free cash flow, which we defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $177 million for the quarter, up 64% year-over-year, and $615 million for the year, up 19% versus 2019. Note that on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was approximately 1.2 times non-GAAP net income. Our strong cash flow results reflect the combination of higher profit and improved working capital efficiency. With a strong cash flow in the quarter, we continued to de-lever. At year-end, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 1.6 times. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with flexibility to consider a range of capital allocation options. We expect to continue to de-lever and pursue modest share buybacks, while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities. Turning to Page 6, I’d like to highlight one of the key drivers of our cash flow in the quarter, working capital. Our working capital efficiency has improved over the last 5 years. We ended the year with just over zero net working capital. This progress was driven by a number of factors, including the growth in deferred revenue from our recurring revenue businesses, reduced [days sales outstanding] of accounts receivable, and lower inventory levels. Turning now to Slide 7, I’ll review in a bit more detail our fourth quarter revenue trends. As I mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our non-recurring revenue streams also grew, driven by a strong rebound in hardware sales in geospatial, civil construction, and agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North America revenues were down 8%, driven by declines in our Transportation business. Revenues in North America from businesses other than Transportation grew 2%. Europe revenues were up 9%, reflecting catch-up on project activity slowed earlier in 2020 and fiscal stimulus measures. Asia Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 13%, driven by strong performance in Japan. The Rest of World, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 10% year-over-year driven principally by strong demand from the agricultural sector. Now turning to Slide 8, I’ll review briefly our full-year results. Revenue for the full-year 2020 contracted 4% overall and 5% organically. Gross margins for the year expanded 140 basis points, and EBITDA grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3%. Operating income grew 7% year-over-year, and operating income margins expanded 220 basis points to 22.8%. Net income was up 12% and earnings per share were $2.23, up 12% year-over-year. Next, on Slide 9, we highlight a number of key metrics, which collectively give a good picture of the state of our business. I’ll highlight a few metrics, which neither Rob nor I have already mentioned. In this year of strong margins, we continued to spend over 15% of our revenue in research and development, reflecting our continued investment in areas of strategic importance during the downturn. We ended the year with a backlog of $1.3 billion, up 11% from year ago levels. Our deferred revenue at the end of the year was $614 million, up 13% from the end of 2019. The health of our backlog and deferred revenue point to improved visibility for revenue growth heading into 2021. Turning now to Slide 10, let's go through the fourth quarter revenue details at the reporting segment level. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of last year’s extra week, organic revenue for the segment would have been up approximately 4%. Revenue growth was double digit in both our SketchUp and Civil hardware businesses. Segment margins were up 90 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 14% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core surveying and mapping business. Revenue was up in all regions, aided by successful new products, stimulus-driven activity, and healthy project tender levels as projects which were delayed earlier in 2020 came back on line. Margins were up over 9 percentage points, due to a combination of higher margin revenue mix, lower levels of discounting, and strong cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis, driven principally by our precision agriculture business. Revenue growth was strongest outside the U.S., with higher commodity prices, stimulus programs, favorable weather, and a strong reception to our new products all contributing to growth in the quarter. Solid performance by our Cityworks business, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, also contributed to segment revenue in the quarter. Margins expanded over 5 percentage points, driven by operating cost control. Transportation revenue was down 22% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2019, organic revenues were down by about 19%. Operating margins were down over 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Our fourth quarter financial performance in Transportation reflects many of the same factors we have discussed in prior quarters. Customer attrition in our mobility business since late 2019 accounts for the majority of the adverse development in segment revenue, ARR, and margins. On that front there is some good news, as our product performance has improved and customer churn has declined sequentially in each of the last three quarters. Note that the ongoing subscription transition in our Transportation enterprise software business [to press revenue] trends in the quarter, and the Kuebix acquisition had an expected dilutive impact on segment margins. While we have more work ahead of us to improve the performance of this business, we continue to believe in the power of our connected Transportation strategy and project the steps the team is taking now will yield improved performance later in 2021. Turning now to Page 11, I’d like to share with you our outlook for this year. Our planning efforts have settled on a 2021 financial outlook based on a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that public health initiatives are successful in enabling a broad re-opening of constrained sectors of the economy by mid-year 2021. Second, our plan is rooted in the assumption that the economy grows through the year, with 2021 GDP at least recovering to 2019 levels. Third, our projections exclude the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. Our most important key performance indicator will continue to be ARR. We expect organic ARR growth to end 2021 in the high-single-digit range, with sequential improvement as the quarter’s progress. ARR growth in 2021 will be driven by the combination of organic growth of our existing recurring offerings, ongoing transitions from perpetual software products, and the gradual turnaround of our Transportation business. We project organic revenue growth in 2021 in the mid-single-digit range, with an additional 1-2 points if exchange rates remain near where they are today. That translates to a revenue range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Note that our revenue growth in 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points from our subscription model transitions. We anticipate that EBITDA and operating margins in 2021 will be higher than 2019, but lower than 2020. Overall our gross margins this year are projected to remain stable with 2020 levels. But a number of factors are likely to cause EBITDA margins to come down somewhat when compared to the historically high levels of 2020. First, the return to a more normalized level of incentive compensation, and in the second half of this year, higher travel costs will naturally cause operating costs to grow at a rate faster than revenue. Second, we are incrementally allocating more capital in both CapEx and operating expense to the areas of focus in our Connect & Scale strategy: namely digital transformation, cloud infrastructure, and autonomy. Third, our margins will be negatively impacted by the accelerated subscription model conversions of 150 basis points. I’ll note that we project income from equity method investments to be approximately $35 million to $40 million, and net interest expense to be about $65 million to $70 million with decreasing levels as the year progresses. We project our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%, and that our shares outstanding will be approximately 254 million. Incorporating all of these factors, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 for the full-year. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to project that operating cash flow and free cash flow will exceed net income, as the favorable cash characteristics of our business will continue. Nevertheless, cash flow will likely be flat or decline modestly from 2020 levels, as we saw extraordinary improvement in working capital in late 2020. A few words on the segment dynamics in our outlook: Generally we expect that each of our segments will mirror the trends I have just described, although I’ll highlight a few factors specific to the individual segments. In Buildings & Infrastructure, our hardware offerings were most adversely impacted by COVID in the second quarter of 2020, so we expect growth in the second quarter of 2021 to be very strong. Our Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities businesses have a lot of momentum now and we anticipate that momentum to generate strong growth through the first half of the year with more moderate growth thereafter. In Transportation, we don’t expect to see meaningful revenue growth or margin improvement until late in 2021. We don’t intend to provide quarterly guidance at this point. But I’ll offer a few comments on factors that will influence our revenue and margin performance as the year progresses. Year-on-year growth in each quarter will obviously be impacted by the COVID-driven swings we have seen in 2020. We expect to grow in all four quarters, with the strongest growth rate in the second quarter, when we lap the worst period of the COVID crisis. We expect that operating and EBITDA margins will be relatively constant across the quarters. Rob, back to you for closing comments.
Rob Painter: As we wrap up, I would like to thank the Trimble team and our global dealer partner network for their outstanding efforts throughout 2020. We entered the crisis with an objective to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing. I’m proud of our accomplishments in 2020 and the progress and commitment we are making towards our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We enter 2021 with increased conviction in our ability to fulfill our mission to “Transform the Way the World Works.” Furthermore, I’d also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Trimble’s inclusion in the S&P 500 as of January 21, a milestone for Trimble’s growth and global impact. Thank you to our customers, our global dealer partners, and our employees past and present for making this possible. It has been a remarkable 42-year journey as a company, and our best days are yet to come. Operator, let’s please go to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. 
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.
Rob Painter: Hi, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: Results continue to be very impressive on the margin side, and really among the better companies that we follow, I kind of have a strategic question on the results, it is just, it seems like farmers continue to adopt very quickly, you know, whatever tech offerings they're offered. There’s been a lot of, you know take rate success with different products, people have put out. My question is a little bit on how you see the shape of that market evolving? Whether there's a lot in the acquisition pipeline that you want to do or need to do to create increasingly integrated offerings? And, you know how strong your product pipeline is for the next couple or three years? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Rob. So if we look at the primary products that we offer in the agriculture market today, that would capture guidance, it would capture water management, it would include the variable rates, and then we also have the weed seeker product. So spot spray optimization, and then I would, you know, and then there's the software that we have. And so the strategy we have is the connected farm strategy in agriculture. So, just from an organic view of our product portfolio, we are bullish on the opportunities in agriculture to connect what we're doing together to create additional ROI for our customers. What we'll build on top of that is our autonomy strategy, and we see autonomy as a series of increasing levels of automation over the coming quarters and years to move us really more into that autonomous future. So, we believe we can do a lot of this organically. From an acquisition perspective, you know, we're certainly open if there's acquisitions that could help us accelerate our development and our efforts in any of those, any of those areas.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks, Rob. Are you able to give any metrics on this hand spray, how that product has been going? And I'll stop. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Well, we've seen strong double-digit increases in the Weedseeker and the Weedseeker 2. So, yeah, we’ve seen strong increases and really think we're going to see them really for a while. We initially saw that the take rate being very high in South America and then we see that moving around the world.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jason Celino: Yeah. Thanks, guys. So you gave the update on the transportation enterprise bookings were 80% of subscription. But I'm curious, you know, what was that mix at the beginning of the year because you've talked about accelerating the transition here? And then, more broadly speaking, how should investors measure the progress of the different business solutions you have? And then why not give more metrics like this on a more recurring basis?
Rob Painter: So Jason, this is Rob -- at the beginning of the year, we were tracking closer to an inverse of that, because we're really pretty early in the transformation of our enterprise business, so that bookings mix is pretty, actually exceeded our expectations of how quickly it has shifted to subscription offering. And when we do that 80/20 comparison, that’s at a TCV or total contract value levels, right. So, we can do it on an apple-to-apple basis. In terms of measuring the progress of the business and how we measure and look at the proof points in the business, we'll certainly hit on the first one right away, which is the ratio of the of the bookings because that's what we're, you know, the strategy, the end game, from a financial model perspective is to build a recurring offering, and we're talking about the enterprise business because we already have that in our maps business. We already have that in our mobility business, and we really also have that in our shipper business. So, really it's an additive view of moving that direction. And finally, you asked about, you know, additional measures or metrics that we could report in transportation. I think we have an Investor Day. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're going to target for the second half of the year. I think it's – we just have to make sure we get the right ones to tell the right story. I'm as – I think, as much as anything showing proof points, like the customer examples, such as the example that was in one of the slides, is the kind of demonstrable evidence that I want to be able to continue to put forward to our investors.
Jason Celino: Okay, great. Those were my two. So, thank you.
Rob Painter: You're welcome.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.
Ann Duignan: Hi, good evening it’s Ann Duignan, just FYI. Maybe, Rob, you could give us a rundown on the B&I business, just, you know, the different applications there, and some of the trends you're seeing and you know, usually give us an update on ARR for SketchUp, e-Builder Viewpoint, etcetera just, you know, a little deeper dive into that business and the outlook into 2021 specifically?
Rob Painter : Sure. Hi, Ann, it’s good to hear from you. So let's start in B&I if we run through the outlook, and what we're hearing from some of the different constituents throughout the chain. I’d start with saying that the outlook is pretty good. There are a few exceptions, but the outlook is pretty good. If we look at the type of work, infrastructure and residential backlogs are improving. EPC is down, so that's going to relate to oil and gas multi-sector, which picks up commercial work that looks flat to down, and not surprisingly retail is down and elements such as data centers and logistics centers are up. When we look at the public sector, the outlook is generally better than it was a quarter as you know the financing is in a stronger position. In January, the Dodge index was at its highest level since the pandemic started. Now, they did warn the recovery may be uneven in the coming months, which sounds about right. And at an OEM level, I would say the signals are mixed, so it is stronger and heavy equipment less so in the automotive space. So, in aggregate that outlook is a net positive. On the ARR front and B&I, really a very solid quarter, really the teams executed at an outstanding level in the quarter and for the year. Our net retention in businesses such as e-Builder and Viewpoint, they're well over a 100%. We had mid-teens ARR growth in Viewpoint and e-Builder. So, continued strong performance from those businesses and those operators. Did I miss anything Ann?
Ann Duignan: No, I think you captured it all pretty eloquently. Maybe just switching back to transportation, can you just talk a little bit about, you know, what happens if you cannot get the business back to the 20% margin target? You know, what are the strategic alternatives? You know would you be willing now, will you be willing to look at some portfolio cleansing or is the business too strategic to you, you know, even if it takes longer to get back to 20% you're going to ride it out and just curious over the long-term what your contingency plans are?
Rob Painter: The transportation business we see as strategic when we see it as attractive. We think we've got a favorable position and a favorable offering. And, you know, I think we have the, say the coverage of assets in this sector, which I think would be quite enviable from a competitive standpoint. So from the 20% level, that's absolutely the target that we have is to get this segment backup to the, I’ll call it the company level of profitability. In terms of how we measure that, you know, given how much of the business is recurring, we'll also look at it from a customer lifetime value perspective. So, I'll be cautious to be overly dogmatic about the 20% so long as we're continuing to get the bookings and to grow the business – grow the business and get that trajectory. So, the first order of business is to be able to show that demonstrable trajectory, which we said, we feel like we'll be able to do towards the later part of the year, second half of the year. And as we've got that trajectory, I think that's going to give all of us the confidence in what we're doing. And you know, we'll look at measures such as lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost, because that's a very indicative measure of how the business progresses. And then from the broader, I’d say strategic lens of it, we'll continue to look at – be open to looking at assets or partnerships that help us further and accelerate the strategy.
Ann Duignan: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. I’ll get back in line. I appreciate it.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you for taking our questions. This is [Kristin] on for Colin. Just wanted to ask a little bit about some of the increased spend that you've highlighted for 2021, the CapEx and OpEx targeting Connect and Scale, the digital information, cloud infrastructure autonomy, etcetera. And just wanted to see, you know, if you could provide a little bit more color there and where you're seeing exactly the opportunities to accelerate and how that connects back to the Connect and Scale strategy?
David Barnes: Hi, [Kristin] it’s David Barnes. So, as you pointed out, a meaningful portion of the increase in year-on-year operating expenditure will be really centered on the Connect and Scale strategy. So, we have a major initiative underway to accelerate our digital transformation. There’s technology and process changes that will enable us to fulfill the potential we have to sell integrated offerings to customers, and we have a major push there. So, our CapEx, which was in the past two years more focused on facilities is this year very much focused on digital transformation, and cloud infrastructure as well, which will enable us to enhance our position as a world-class provider, integrated cloud based services. So that's where the focus of our investment is.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then I guess my follow-up would be, Rob, you [hearkened] us back to the 2018 Analyst Day. You know, back at that time, I think you outlined a calculus of high-single-digit organic growth, you know, 25% to 30%, incremental margins 20% operating margin, you know, as they think about Connect and Scale, and maybe beyond the 2021 timeframe, is that still the right formula that we should be thinking about for Trimble?
Rob Painter: At a high level, it is [Kristin]. What I would augment from a measurement perspective is ARR growth. That is our primary focus of the, you know, the measurements out there. And that interplay, you know, between ARR, and the overall growth is important. So, I'll trade all day long. The top line revenue growth if it's going, if it's moderated because we're accelerating ARR and that's one that I think needs to rise higher in the pecking order.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.
Operator: Next is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.
James Faucette: Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the quarter and the progress. I maybe wanted to touch again on the geospatial side, and I know in your prepared remarks, you kind of noted one of the drivers being retail demand in North America. And that seems interesting, just given a preferences for where people live coming out of the pandemic and strong just residential construction more broadly. Can you maybe remind us how much of that business is exposed to residential construction? And you know, if you think that can be a lasting tailwind if it's more near term and source normalized and just what your expectations are over the next year or so?
Rob Painter: Sure, and I'll start by up leveling to the whole segment where we saw the outperformance come from a combination of three things: healthy demand, catch up in work, and the third is new products. So, in Europe, we know we think there's an anticipation of a construction led recovery tax incentives also helped, I should add. In North America, there's residential and from the new product innovation perspective our R12i GNSS receiver and the X7 scanner we think really led demand in all our markets. In North America specifically, and looking at residential, we see that as a near to mid-term catalyst, and then I would, you know, have an anticipation of normalization there. If we were to see, you know, more infrastructure work, then clearly our mix would shift or balance with the residential and infrastructure work. Historically, residential has not been a primary driver of the Trimble business. So, it certainly has been an accelerant, certainly from a percentage standpoint.
James Faucette: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just one follow up, I guess, as perpetual licenses started to recover, at least grew in the quarter, I guess some of that’s seasonally based just on timing of when those get renewed or should we think of that as more indicative of demand just broadly recovering? And if some of the push-outs and subscription growth could also be an opportunity to more quickly convert to subscription based offerings?
David Barnes: Yeah, hey, James. It’s David. Part of what you saw with the perpetual business is, we had meaningful slowdown in earlier quarters, as you'll know. So there's – some of that is catch up on projects that were delayed. Overall, the perpetual sales will obviously be – there will be pressure on that from the subscription transition. So, over time, in many of our businesses, the significant majority, we will be selling recurring rather than perpetual licenses for those businesses where a recurring model is viable.
James Faucette: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is coming in from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein.
Chad Dillard: Good evening, guys. So my question is on, just like the mid-cycle revenues for the transportation business? And how to think about that in this coming cycle versus prior cycles, you know, do expect to actually recover some of the churn that you've experienced? And then how should we think about the impact of, you know, the mix shift – some of the mix shift in there?
Rob Painter: We'll start with the question around cycle, because it tends not to be relevant in the Trimble context. It tends to be, you know, I would associate that to an industrial – a straight industrial context, and the fundamental nature of the markets that we're serving as their large global underserved and under penetrated by technology. So our correlation hasn't historically been very tight to cycles. So, I would really see the Trimble story as a secular story with a cyclical undertone. So, the cycle obviously has an impact, but a secular first cyclical undertone. From an expectation of, I think you asked about recovering turn, recovering business in the transportation market. Yes, we're very optimistic around that. I mean, that's table stakes, frankly. And we look at the pieces we have across the technology, landscape, and transportation, and we think we're in a favorite position. We've got over 90% of the top 100 trucking companies use our technology. We've got over a million powered assets. They're managed in the Trimble network. I look at the set of capabilities we have. We do telematics, video, ERP, maintenance, mapping, routing, navigation, analytics, visibility.  So, we have a strong set of capabilities. I believe it brings scale to the market. And when we look at Connect and Scale applied in the transportation context, that's where I think we've become really unique as if we can sell [outcome], we look at the bundled offerings. And then not only bundled offerings, but where we can provide unique value by stitching together our products. And that's actually why we put that slide as an example of Trimble dispatch advisor because into the slides is because that's an example where we're pulling capabilities across our tech stack into a uniquely Trimble – and to a unique Trimble offering. So, I hope that helps – give you context and let me know if I missed something.
Chad Dillard: Yeah, no, that's, that's helpful. And then just second question, just on the 150 basis points, so we've had one from subscription transitions, can you remind us, how does it compare versus 2020? And, you know, how should we think about that in the context of the next couple of years? Are we at the peak in terms of like the overall basis point impact?
David Barnes: Hi Chad, it’s David. The 150 basis points is more than 2020, probably about half again more. So, we're closer to 100 basis points. And that does reflect that in some of the businesses where there's a clear near term opportunity to make the transition. We anticipate making major progress this year. A little early to call [2022] on that. So, I'll resist the temptation, although we are, at that point getting past the valley for many of the subscription businesses, and we'll see more revenue uptick from that than we will this year.
Chad Dillard: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Nice to see the momentum on subscription transition, I'm wondering if you could talk about any parts of the transition plan that you folks might be accelerating, heading into 2021, given how strong the preference has been among customers for subscription versus perpetual license. And, David, I'm wondering if you could share the revenue number that's associated with that margin point that you just made? So, if we had, you know, run rate revenue, in 2021, how much higher would it be versus you know, the GAAP revenue guidance that you're providing once we get, you know, the existing products, transition to subscription?
David Barnes: Hey, Jerry, I'll do the second question first, and then hand it over to rob. So, I think I've got your question, right. The 150 basis points, what we're saying there is that if we weren't doing the next round of transitions, our revenue would be 150 basis points higher, and that nearly all flows to operating income, because the margin is very high.
Rob Painter: And Jerry, from acceleration perspective, within the business, I look at Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation. So within Buildings and Infrastructure, you know, we're talking about our building construction businesses accelerating the subscription transformations there. We mentioned in transportation, for example, the 80/20, booking split subscription to perpetual that we're seeing in the enterprise business right now. So, there I would call those the model conversions that are accelerating. And, you know, that's separate from businesses that you already know, like the viewpoints in builders and construction that continue to demonstrate strong growth. And then the last thing I would mention is, on the hardware side, you know, we are in very early days, but you know, early days of the – essentially it’s the hard ways of service, we call it Trimble platform as a service in the civil construction phase.
Jerry Revich: And in terms of capital deployment, can you talk about your M&A pipeline, as it stands today, obviously, strong free cash conversion. I'm wondering how deep is that pipeline? Because, you know, unfortunately, post the e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions, you know, multiples for those types of assets have moved up significantly. So, I'm wondering if you could just comment on, if the pipeline has subscription type businesses in it, and just expand on that opportunity set in-light of the free cash flow, if you don't mind?
Rob Painter: Hey Jerry, I characterize our M&A pipeline as being open for business. We have the confidence to assert our strategy, and we have the balance sheet to support it. As it relates to the, I’d say the opportunities themselves within the pipeline. I would say they're decent. I wouldn't say they're like overly robust. And on the other side there, you know, it's also not non-existent. So, I'd say it's a decent pipeline. And when we look at that pipeline, we certainly have a bias. You know, we think about that with a bias, well it’s more than a bias, the imperative is to support the Connect and Scale strategy. The bias, then within supporting the strategy is certainly towards software assets. But David also mentioned, you know, from a – linking it to capital allocation, where we're spending on the digital transformation, we look at capabilities and cloud, we look at capabilities and autonomy, for example. And so autonomy is another area that I would, you know put on that list, and I wouldn't – it doesn't classically define a software.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Richard Eastman from Baird.
Richard Eastman: Hey, I just want to circle back if you wouldn't mind, and good afternoon, by the way, just wanted to circle back to – the recurring revenue in the quarter looks like it was down, you know, a couple ticks year-over-year. Is that a function of the transportation business?
Rob Painter: Hey, Rick. Organic ARR was actually up a little bit. We should have a business, but yeah, organics improved a little bit.
Richard Eastman: And when you define organic, are you pulling out transportation?
Rob Painter: Nope. I'm pulling out the business. Hey, Rick, if you just be careful, you're looking at the 14th week impact. Because the recurring revenue, just take that piece of the P&L. That has an 8% impact.
Richard Eastman: I see. Okay. All right, then that's going to be the difference. So, organic ARR in the quarter was up low singles. And then for 2021, did I catch in your comments that recurring revenue is expected to grow high single digits?
Rob Painter: Yeah. So organic was up 7 in the Q4, and we said we'd end the year, our guidance is high-single-digits. So, faster than we are now, sequentially improving through the year for all the reasons I mentioned: organic growth of our existing offerings, the transitions and improvement of transportation.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then, as we look out to, you know, your revenue guide, and your, you know, adjusted op income guide, and EPS guide I guess, you know, at the mid-point of your revenue guide, and EPS guide, we kind of walk up to this, maybe low, low double digits, incremental. And what that's absorbing here, I'm sorry, probably ever repeating what you said already. But what that's absorbing is, you know, almost 50 million of profit from the SaaS conversion headwind, and then the balance of that would be just expense re-inflation in the business.
Rob Painter: Yeah, you've got the key factors. So, the conversions are there. And then OpEx, as I mentioned, is growing faster than revenue. Some of that is just replacing costs that that sort of naturally came out during the COVID period. So, we will have higher incentive compensation expense. We anticipate that we’ll begin to travel later in the year. A lot of the things we do normally including hiring were really low. And we are investing, as Rob said in the cloud and digital transformation. And then I'll add that part of the OpEx increase is FX because the U.S. dollars weaken. So, over half of our business is outside the U.S. so that naturally causes OpEx to grow.
Richard Eastman: Okay. I get you. And just one last question, I apologize, the civil business, how do inventories in the channel look there? Is there better – it is book-to-bill or just the sell through, you know, is the sell through greater than the sell-in into the channel on the civil side, the hardware side?
Rob Painter: Inventories are low. Yeah.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Okay. Very good. Excellent. Thank you for the time.
Operator: Next question is from the line from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to start out with, I guess you made the comment that you're coming out of the downturn stronger and you've been investing 15% into R&D, which is above the typical average. Can you maybe give us some examples of how this has been driving share gains and where you're seeing this show up the most in terms of that competitive position?
Rob Painter: Hi Jonathan, I see it in a few areas. One would be through innovation. And so an example we talked about in geospatial is with the R12i and the X7, so the right demonstrable evidence that the investment in R&D is producing new products. And we've seen that in Ag with Weedseeker. As an example, we've seen it in Buildings and Infrastructure with the model conversions, a lot of innovation actually happening there and creating some derivative opportunities in areas such as analytics, for example. And the other place where I see us coming out of – stronger is from an organizational culture perspective. Okay, that's hard to, let's say, measure as it relates to share gains or the other aspects. But I really think when you look at our employee engagement it's in a very strong place. We look at the retention of our people. We're doing well there. We look at – I talked to – used an example in the prepared remarks around how we've ranked in diversity and inclusion score. So, we see the culture in a strong place. And then from a share gain aspect, how all of this relates to, let's say, share gains in our competitive position, it's – I have to admit it's notoriously difficult to be very specific on share gains in our markets. It's just really not a lot of good data. So, you can't – you really can't find like the singular report that's going to tell you all of this. So certainly, we're looking at our results, compared to competitive results. We see how – we look at our win/loss ratios and the businesses that we have, and they indicate to us that we're maintaining or gaining share across the business.
Jonathan Ho: Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, you outlined a number of customers in your examples that are buying a broader solution set. How do we think about ARR growth relative to either new customer acquisitions or upsell just given you can sell a broader suite of solutions today?
Rob Painter: Yeah. It's a good question, Jonathan. And we'll keep including examples from now on to show you these proof points around Connect & Scale. Like an example, we didn't put in the deck this quarter is a construction example. So, we sold two in our 400 customers a bundled offering last year. And in both of those examples, we were able to increase ARR 30% with each of those customers by virtue of creating a – essentially a one Trimble offering, making it a lot easier to do business with us. I mean that's the kind of – that's the evidence, as it were, of where we're going and why we're doing this. We see where we're going with Connect & Scale, giving us an ability to better connect the products we have to streamline customer experience and handoffs between the products and the workflows. That expands the value proposition of our offering. It increases and improves the user experience of the products. And along the way, we'll enhance our customer success operations to drive a deeper intimacy with our customers. And we believe that's going to provide our customers better value. They'll get that productivity, quality, safety, visibility, and sustainability out of using our solutions, and that's going to unlock ARR potential. I'll close by saying when we – as we prepared our plans for the year and looking at our strategies and our connected strategies, we're looking at the ARR opportunity from cross-selling and upselling and bundling. And we believe there's a lot of opportunity within our house.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital.
Gal Munda: Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Guys, the first one, I would just like to ask you about this trend of the billings, you've basically seen deferred revenue growing ahead of ARR again, which kind of indicates the backlog is building up. And in terms of that, I just want to – wanted to see what's driving it? Is there any change in duration of the contract or anything or it's just the natural backlog buildup?
David Barnes: Yeah. Gal, it's David. The biggest driver of deferred revenue and backlog is the growth of our recurring businesses. It's not a – it's actually – yes, it's not a meaningful change in the duration of contracts.
Gal Munda: Awesome. Thank you so much. And then the other question I had is considering the fact that obviously, professional services are under pressure in a year like this – like 2020 was, how are you thinking coming back from 2020 in terms of the professional services? Some companies have basically – it's definitely helped your gross margins in general. But my question is like, do you reassess how much services you have to provide in order to kind of protect that margin? Or are you quite happy for that revenue to come back as fast as it can? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Hi, Gal, this is Rob. I'll start and maybe David will want to add. I think pro services might be a tale of two halves in 2021, first half, second half. Look at the first half. I think that will probably mirror much of what we saw last year where it's difficult to, in many cases, get in to do the implementation. And we've done better and we're learning how to do it, but there are businesses that we have where the pro service is significantly challenged as a result. From a – impact on Trimble gross margins, we don't have that much pro serv. So, it's not really – it's not a fundamental driver of the gross margin at Trimble. I'm looking and thinking more about the revenue impact it would have than, let's say, a margin profile impact at a company level. David, do you see it [similar]?
David Barnes: Yes. I think the only thing I'd add is that some of this is by designer, reflecting the mix shift of the business to more standardized offerings that require less professional services. But that said, what Rob said, some of our professional services business was highly constrained because we couldn't get access to the customer. So, it's a mix of both.
Gal Munda: Got it, okay. Thank you so much. Great results and good luck.
David Barnes: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research.
Blake Gendron: Yes, hey good evening. Thanks for squeezing me on here. My question was around just heightened investment levels for this digital transformation. Wondering if we can delineate, both on the CapEx side and maybe from an R&D perspective, how much is kind of due to this digital transformation. Then as we model it in the out-year, should we think of it over a fixed amount of time or are you essentially going to scale these investment levels with the receptivity of a cloud solution across the portfolio? Thanks.
David Barnes: Yes. Hey Blake, it's David. This is definitely a multi-year effort. And I'll say of the OpEx increase that you can interpolate from our guidance, somewhere around $100 million year-on-year, about a quarter is in the broad category of the strategic investments, which is cloud infrastructure, digital transformation and autonomy. And we've got a lot of conviction around this. This is not all entirely incremental. We started this effort. It was more within divisions or pieces of the business, and now it's a company-wide effort. What we're doing is developing playbook with standard processes that enable cross-selling and a common digital experience across the business. We'll course-correct to see how well it goes. We've got a phased implementation process, but I do see this investment extending beyond this year.
Blake Gendron: Understood. That's helpful. And then within that, as we think about something like data security, obviously, it's going to be important for your customers as they consider the move to the cloud. It's also going to be a fairly big cost, I would imagine, no matter what cloud application or a cloud platform you're running. So, how do you think about data security in terms of internalizing those costs versus maybe outsourcing those costs and kind of partnering with a third-party tier?
Rob Painter: Well, there's no question that we're spending more on cybersecurity. It's – these are the kind of existential issues that all of us in technology businesses face as we manage our customers' systems of record. So, it's incredibly important that we are world-class in the area of cybersecurity. Our spend is really OpEx. It's not CapEx-oriented today. It's primarily our own teams, but we will use third parties to do intrusion detection for an example – or it's best practice. So, we follow best practices, what you want to do with external firms. Of course, we use a lot of external technology but, right, you pay for that on an OpEx basis. It's not capitalized. The last thing I would say around the area of cyber is, as many threats as it provides, we also see it as an opportunity to distinguish ourselves. And the scope, the scale, the breadth of Trimble, we see as an advantage here because this is something customers are increasingly having to look at. And our ability to manage at scale and at this level of sophistication outstrips the ability of a smaller company to keep up and actually draw parallel to things like GDPR. And these are expensive endeavors, and our scale helps in that aspect of it.
Blake Gendron: Awesome. Thanks for your time.
Rob Painter: Thank you.
Operator: We have no questions at this time. Michael, you may continue.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please go ahead. 
Rob Painter: Hello, everyone and thanks for taking the time to be with us today. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. We'll start on slide 2 with the four key messages we want to convey today. First, the resilience of our team, the quality of our strategy and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the third quarter. ARR grew 10% year-over-year to $1.26 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $793 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.8%. Our shift to a more hardware connected, software centric and recurring revenue business model is working. I want to express my gratitude to the Trimble team, who continues to perform strongly under these challenging conditions, as well as our customers and investors for your continued support and confidence in Trimble. Second, executing on the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders and industry lifecycle data to improve and transform customer workflows. The business model transitions are an output of this strategy, not an input. Third, we continue to put organizational elements in place to enable the strategy. Most recently we have named James Dalton, as our newest Board member; and we promoted from within to hire a Chief People Officer, a Chief Digital Officer, a VP of Talent & Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and a Head of Sustainability. Fourth, our long-term conviction remains strong. We will balance cost containment and investment in innovation during the downturn. On one hand, we've reduced our cost base in transportation in the quarter. On the other hand, we continue to increase our investments in autonomy and digital transformation. We maintain our goal to exit this recession on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it; and on that note, we are in a more proactive mode of looking for acquisition opportunities, which will advance our Connect & Scale strategy. At the reporting segment level, a few strategic comments to make. In Buildings & Infrastructure, we saw better-than-expected results in civil construction machine control and guidance. In addition, our software businesses delivered a strong level of recurring revenue growth. In Geospatial, innovation is sparking demand. Our end customers have been getting back to work and catching up on project activity. In Resources & Utilities, the agriculture market has been resilient. In North America, for example, commodity prices have risen, while direct support payments to farmers remain well above historical averages. Markets such as Australia, Japan and Brazil all performed well in the quarter. These overall favorable conditions combined with the compelling ROI on investing in precision agriculture have contributed to our growth in 2020. In Transportation, we took several meaningful steps, which we believe will position the business for better performance in the quarters and years ahead. We implemented a substantial restructuring in the business during the third quarter, which will lower our ongoing fixed operating costs. Further, we made business plan decisions which resulted in an inventory charge in the third quarter. With these difficult decisions behind us, we can now see the path for improved performance in 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020. At the macro level, market conditions have begun to improve in the transportation market with higher asset utilization, improved spot prices and increasing capital investment. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic that market conditions will support sustained growth for Trimble through 2021. As we move from election mode to governing mode we will follow decisions on stimulus measures, especially, infrastructure and local government funding and policy decisions relating to trade and tax. Let me now turn the call over to David for a review of the numbers. 
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's begin on slide 3 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $793 million, up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Net of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange fluctuations organic revenue declined 1%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.8% up 180 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by improved revenue mix and also assisted by lower discounting and new products with higher margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, up 380 basis points year-over-year, a result of both gross margin expansion and cost reduction. Cost reduction was driven by structural actions and temporary factors related to COVID-19. Operating income margins also expanded 360 basis points to 24.2%. Net income dollars increased by 26% on a year-over-year basis, while earnings per share increased by $0.12 to $0.60 per share. Turning to slide 4. Our third quarter cash flow from operations was $181 million, reflecting the strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow represented approximately 1.2 times non-GAAP net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $165 million. We paid down over $150 million of net debt in the quarter and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.9 times. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $184 million in cash. In addition, we have no scheduled principal payments on our debt, until July 2022. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. Next on slide 5, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue, which as a reminder includes the annualized value of term licenses was $1.26 billion in the third quarter, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Organic growth of ARR was 6%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble organic ARR grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue represents approximately 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis demonstrating the asset-light nature of our business model. We continue to proactively manage our costs, while maintaining investment in key initiatives. Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was nearly 15% of revenue. Two additional metrics that we follow are deferred revenue and backlog. Our deferred revenue was up 20% on a year-over-year basis through a combination of organic and acquisition-related growth and our backlog was $1.2 billion, up more than 10% versus prior year. These two metrics give us additional visibility into the future revenue trends in the quarters ahead. Turning to slide 6. Recurring revenues made up 37% of total Trimble revenue in the quarter compared to 35% a year ago. We experienced recurring revenue growth, across a wide range of businesses. Even in a tough economic environment, these offerings are essential to the operation of our customers' businesses. Our non-recurring revenues, including hardware perpetual software and professional services, experienced a year-over-year decline of about 2% in the quarter. Performance in these areas was helped by strength in our Geospatial and agriculture businesses, offset by expected weak performance in Transportation. Overall, our professional service trends improved somewhat in the quarter from the beginning of the COVID crisis, but are still negatively impacted by lack of access to our customers' facilities and employees. In terms of geography, North America was down 5% representing a sequential improvement when compared to the second quarter, which was down 17%. Revenues in North America were adversely impacted by the declines in our Transportation business. Excluding Transportation, revenue in North America grew over 2% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe was up 9%, reflecting broad-based improvement in project activity across the continent. Asia Pacific was once again the best performer in the quarter up 16%. Agriculture was a bright spot in Asia Pacific in the quarter as Australia recovered from a multiyear drought and the Japanese government implemented increased direct support of farmers. Our business in China, while still small grew year-on-year in the third quarter as the country recovered from the easing of COVID-related shutdowns. Turning now to slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in our software businesses. Segment margins were up nearly four percentage points, due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 7% on an organic basis, driven principally by increased sales to OEM customers. Revenue from sales of system to the surveying and mapping sector was essentially flat versus prior year, a meaningful improvement from the second quarter when revenues were down nearly 20% year-on-year. Margins were up over 11 percentage points due to a combination of higher-margin revenue mix, compelling new products, lower levels of discounting and strong cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 16% on an organic basis. We benefited from double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. M&A growth also played a role in the segment growth in the quarter as the integration of Cityworks has added significant capability to our offerings for utilities and local governments. Margins expanded over 7 percentage points, driven by improved revenue mix strong profitability from M&A and cost control. While top line results in Transportation were consistent with our expectations coming into the quarter, the business performed well below our long-term objectives. Segment revenue was down 21% on an organic basis and margins declined over 10 percentage points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we highlighted in our last earnings call. The rate of revenue decline did improve in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter as did customer retention. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by lower revenue subscription transition and M&A as well as an inventory charge that we took in the mobility business. Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We continue to face significant uncertainty in market demand across the industry sectors we serve. With the rate of COVID-19 infection increasing in many countries, our customers face renewed risks of work restrictions stemming from governmental rules to curb the spread of the virus. And the pace of the recovery in the broader economy remains uncertain. As a result, we still don't have sufficient clarity in the end-user demand to enable us to give guidance. As we did last quarter, we will provide some color on the most important trends which will drive our performance. Starting with revenue. I'll remind you that our fiscal year 2019 had an extra week. The lack of the 14th week this quarter will adversely impact overall Trimble revenue growth by approximately $23 million or about 3%. In this quarter, we will enjoy less benefit from projects deferred at the onset of the pandemic last spring. Finally, the combination of lapping our Cityworks acquisition from the fourth quarter of 2019 and the recent divestiture of Construction Logistics resulted in less favorable inorganic revenue growth momentum. Considering all of these factors, we anticipate that total Trimble revenue will be down modestly versus prior year in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless we expect that our recurring revenue businesses will remain robust with organic ARR growth in line with third quarter 2020 performance. Note again that Cityworks, which is principally a recurring term license business, was part of Trimble for much of the fourth quarter in 2019. From a segment perspective, Resources and Utilities revenue will continue to grow in the fourth quarter albeit at a more modest rate as we lap the strong fourth quarter of last year. Transportation revenues are likely to decline at a rate comparable to what we experienced in the third quarter. The Geospatial and Buildings and Infrastructure segments are likely to see revenue trends at about the company average. Turning to gross margins. We expect margins roughly flat versus prior year in the fourth quarter. The extra week in the fourth quarter of last year did boost margins and we won't have that positive impact in this quarter. Separate from this factor, though, we do expect gross margins to continue their strong performance driven by software mix, new products and reduced discounting. Our operating expenses will grow modestly in the quarter, up approximately $20 million sequentially from the third quarter. With our improved performance outlook for the year, we anticipate higher incentive compensation and we are seeing a gradual increase in discretionary spending across areas where spending was unsustainably low due to COVID restrictions. Assuming the revenue and margin dynamics I've described, we expect to manage to decremental margins in the low to mid-30s. Finally, I will note that we project continued healthy cash flow generation. With our leverage now at our long-term target we have reinstituted a modest share repurchase program. We will continue to employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we manage our capital structure and invest for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Rob to conclude.
Rob Painter: Let me close by turning to slide 9 and reinforcing how we progressed against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy in the quarter. First, connecting solutions across our industry lifecycles. Two examples to share. In Construction, we released WorksOS, which integrates design data from the office with machine control data to deliver real-time progress and productivity updates for the entire jobsite. Slide 10 shows a visual of how Trimble is transforming workflows in construction by connecting the physical and digital worlds. This is how we bring together the office and the field with our hardware and software, in a unique Trimble way. Today, we put a constructible digital engineering model on the blade of construction equipment. With WorksOS, we can dynamically bring back surface data and view progress to plan. In essence, this workflow positions us to take the 3D constructible model and next add dimensions of cost and schedule to create a 5D model. From here we will integrate this enriched model into the construction ERP system with additional, financial and asset management views. The aggregation of all this data, coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is a further step towards an autonomous future. Back to slide 9 and another example from construction, we launched augmented reality into our Trimble earthworks machine control and guidance solution. Augmented reality is available in the cab of the excavator, which helps operators more easily understand 3D models, cut/fill information, slope data and other reference points. Second; delivering breakout innovation. Two examples to share. In Geospatial, our new GNSS receiver, the R12i, has been a market success. The innovation in the GNSS receiver is the integration of inertial technology that enables robust tilt compensation. What this means is that the surveyor can work productively and effectively in challenging environments. We are making our customers’ work easier. The second example is highlighted on slide 11. Our structural BIM software is used for many types of materials and projects. This past month, the team announced the winners of our 2020 BIM awards. On this slide you will see the winners for best infrastructure and best commercial projects. A closer look reveals that these projects deliver more than just incredibly detailed design visualization. What these engineering teams are delivering are the precise specifications needed to automate fabrication for each individual component, as well as instructions for assembling those complex designs in the field. This is what we call “Constructible Design” and these two projects are exemplary. Third; accelerating our business model transformation. In Construction, we sold our first Platform-as-a-Service offering in our civil construction business. We are delivering technology assurance for our customers while integrating construction cloud services and world-class support to keep our customers’ operations current and optimized. Fourth; we are taking actions that enable us to efficiently and effectively scale our business. Last week we closed on the divestiture of our construction logistics business; and in the third quarter we completed the acquisition of a business that further expands our positioning services network to now cover over one million square miles in North America. We are making decisions and investments in the area of cloud enablement, data management, and artificial intelligence that are connected in approach, which will enable us to scale to meet the opportunity ahead of us. With that, I’d like to thank everyone for taking the time to be with us today, and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let’s please go to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital. Your line is now open.
Gal Munda: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. I've got the first one. Just wanted to follow-up on the strong ARR growth, which kind of continued in this quarter. And what I was wondering is, if you can talk a little bit more around the growth drivers of the ARR as in how much is the organic expansions and new customers you're seeing versus how much it is the business model transition of on one side having lower licenses. Yeah that's kind of my first question. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Hi, Gal, welcome back.
Gal Munda: Thank you.
Rob Painter: As it relates to the ARR growth in the quarter, so 10% at a total company level around 6% at an organic level. If we exclude the Transportation business, we'd be in the double-digit growth on ARR including in the construction business, so in the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment. In terms of the breakdown between new customers and existing customers it's both is the short answer where we've seen growth. So we are figuring out a way to sell into new logo customers in this digital environment. So we take a business such as the SketchUp business ARR grew almost actually 50% -- more than 50% year-over-year. And that's clearly coming from an expansion of the addressable market and winning new logos seeing the same thing in the Viewpoint business. Having said that like compared to let's say a prepandemic level it is there is a greater weight towards penetration of existing customers at the total portfolio level and I think it's probably for the obvious reasons. Does that help? 
Gal Munda: That's very helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned your strategic -- one of the strategic levers is connecting the industry life cycles and you talked a little bit more specific about the construction. What I'm wondering is, when you start connecting those dots which previously were kind of best of breed versus now best of suite and you're becoming more of a suite of products, are you finding yourself -- how does that relate to the average contract size that you'd be seeing the sales cycles? And potentially, do you have a new buying center within those companies that you previously sold maybe one tool to someone else there?
Rob Painter: So if I say -- I'll use construction as the example. And you're right. I mean the connect part of the Connect & Scale strategy is absolutely to connect stakeholders data solutions across the industry life cycle, whether it's construction agriculture transportation utilities forestry. To give you an example in construction, we can see -- for example if I just take the Viewpoint business discretely which is the construction management system that system of record for the construction company we've had over $1.5 million of new ACV in the last 12 months. And this is really a customer pull. We're really early I would say in the Trimble push of the strategy. So customer pool essentially to create suites or bundles of solutions to connect into that system of record. So for example -- and construction telematics, the information on asset utilization that can augment job cost which is in the ERP. If we look at our structural business, fabrication management that ties into the material estimates which are in the back office software. If we look at the MEP or mechanical electrical plumbing business, we have there we see the integration of estimating, pricing, change, management job cost and procurement into that system of record. So we're seeing real examples where our customers are asking us to integrate the various Trimble technologies that they have. And we're starting to see a few more new logo wins as a result of being able to come in as a unified face to that customer. In terms of who we sell to in that new model a recent example with an ENR 400 customer who made a significant commitment to Trimble. I was with the CIO. So it starts to look more like C-level when we're up-leveling the sale to an overall Trimble sale. Clearly that correlates to the contract sizes. So let's say as opposed to three, 3 four separate contracts which could be in the tens or low hundreds of thousands each right it starts to become over on a total contract value basis they start to look more like $1 million type deals as where we're heading with it. 
Gal Munda: That’s great, very helpful. Thank you so much and congrats on a great quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Thank you and thanks for the questions. Rob, just first off, I just wanted to ask maybe throw a little bit more color around the Transportation side of the business and maybe how you're viewing this quarter. It sounds like you took some structural costs out of the business in the quarter. But from a revenue and op margin basis, I mean clearly this would suggest maybe a bottom in both of those metrics. And do you see this business starting to form the basis of some growth in 2021 once we get through the year here from a revenue perspective? 
Rob Painter: Rick so I think it's pretty similar narrative to what we had last quarter. I'll start by saying we did meet the topline expectations we have so it's clearly below our long-term ambition. But just to establish I'd say credibility that we can hit the number that we put forward as a starting point there at the topline. What's similar to the narrative from last quarter that holds is we expect that the moves that we're making now we'll see the fruit of that in margin expansion into I'll say the second half of next year. We'll see that more in the second half of next year than the first half. The nature of the recurring revenue business is that it does take a while for that engine to get going. And when it gets going it becomes a cumulative game from that point. So, really a similar view and -- but I think you characterized it well upfront. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just as a follow-up my other question. Just when I look at the hardware revenue in the third quarter, obviously, lots of noise around the second quarter. But I'm curious it did improve double-digits kind of 13% sequentially. Is there any message in there other than the second quarter was really bad? But is there any message in kind of the double-digit sequential rebound on the hardware side of the business just as a basis for follow-on software sales?
David Barnes: Hey Richard, it's David Barnes. I'll offer up a couple of observations. Part of what we did benefit from is catching up on projects that got stalled or delayed in Q2. So, that helped. But that's not all of it. As Rob mentioned we've had a lot of innovation in the Geospatial area which is improving revenue trends and margins by the way. And so -- and we're seeing some -- it's hard to draw a trend in these noisy times, but some improvement in a number of our hardware areas that you're right bring software with it. So a bit of all three.
Richard Eastman: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ann Duignan: Hi, good afternoon. Maybe Rob you could provide some color on the fundamentals around the different end markets. You usually give us some good color in terms of how you're thinking about construction activity from a more macro standpoint particularly now that we most likely won't get a large infrastructure bill. And then similarly on Transportation at least what -- the fundamentals have improved. We've seen a huge increase in truck orders. So, I'm just wondering how you're feeling about the fundamentals specifically in both those industries. Thanks.
Rob Painter: Sure. Hi Ann. So, I'll start with the Buildings and Infrastructure and do a little bit of a walk around the stakeholders. I think the logical place to start would be with the owners. And I'll use -- I'll start in the U.S. thinking about state DOTs or Department of Transportations as owners. And I would say the DOTs have been more resilient than we expected. And so that's been a good thing. So that would be a comment on a large owner segment. If I go next to architecture and when we look at the indicators the ABI is still below 50. Now, we saw September looks more encouraging than the numbers did in August. So, I think the ABI is helpful for macro health. But when we look at our actual architecture and design business it's meaningless because that's the business where we saw ARR up almost 50% year-over-year. If we go to civil construction and I'll stay in North America for a little bit. Civil contractors what we saw is a decrease in backlog with civil contractors, but an increase in backlog with civil engineers. And so that would suggest an initial recovery that could flow through to the contractors. If we look at our Viewpoint business where we could see the system of record for general contractors again confirm that some bookings are slowing and some of the velocity of hiring has been lower as compared to 2019. When we look outside the U.S., if we take construction PMI that shows a mixed view forward with the number of markets expecting expansion next year with I'd say an emphasis on Europe, when I quote construction PMI numbers. We also look at a basket of backlog at some of the largest construction companies in North America and Europe. And what we see there is that – and this is not surprising, we see that residential is doing well. Commercial's down. EPC and infrastructure have been down a little bit. So what we see, if I try to summarize that is, we see some of the end market work moving around. I would say, the numbers we see today are unambiguously better than what we saw in that March, April, May time frame. What's conflicting are the signals on sustained demand, and I think I would close on that, one by saying, what we do feel is that there is unequivocal demand for digitization and improved access to information. So we think at the secular level, we're in the right place. And if I go to Transportation, and I probably could start actually with some of the research you had we certainly saw that the Class eight unit sales well they're below last year, but they clearly improved in the last few months. So we do see some higher asset utilization improved spot prices and increasing capital investments. So Transportation does look like, it's in quite a bit better place at a macro level than it was a few months ago. I'll pause there, and see if I answered your question.
Ann Duignan: Yeah. No, that's helpful. It's always good to get your perspective from what you're seeing kind of feet on the street. And then again, on Transportation more on the margin side, you had talked about last quarter, the lower margins and you gave us a contribution. I think it was 3% macro, 3% Kuebix and 3% subscription conversion and then the rest to get back to the 20% was going to be kind of self-help. Could you provide us any kind of qualitative – just where you think you are today in terms of how much of the margin was macro? How much was Kuebix? How much was subscription conversion? And then also how much of the margin decline was actually the restructuring and the inventory write-off?
David Barnes: Hey, Ann, it's David Barnes. I'd say, the factors that we talked about last quarter are similar. The new one is that, we updated our plan going forward on the mobility side of the business. And running through those numbers, we did take an inventory charge, which essentially explains all of the delta between the operating margin in the second quarter and the third quarter.
Ann Duignan: Okay. But I think you said, you took some restructuring charges also. Or was the inventory write-down the restructuring?
David Barnes: No, we did a workforce reduction. But Ann that shows up in the non-GAAP restructuring charges.
Ann Duignan: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Ann.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. As you have worked through this restructuring on the T&L business and you're looking at some of the changes in the ELD offering, can you talk about kind of early returns and feedback from customers in terms of engagement and in terms of the receptivity? And how do you generally think that transition is going to progress? How long should we be thinking about this working through a transition period?
Rob Painter: So, Colin, I'll start with the setup at the financial level and then pivot to the strategic level. At the financial level, I'll anchor that really a similar narrative from the last quarter is that we expect to see more of the flow-through improvement to the bottom line in the second half of next year than in the first half of 2021. So we're taking the moves now to position the business for long-term success long-term progression. At the – that's the financial answer. At the strategy level, the strategy we're pursuing in Transportation is that of a connected supply chain. That means connecting carriers and connecting shippers. So that isn't changing. In fact, it's progressing I think in a positive way. And on the carrier side that means connecting the driver, the truck, the fleet. And we believe that the three legs of the technology stack are telematics, which we call mobility; the back office which we refer to as our enterprise, business; and then our mapping business for the routing mapping navigation engine. And so we believe at the intersection of those three aspects that we can do something unique as Trimble in terms of connecting carriers. And then -- or in addition and in parallel is connecting the carriers to the shippers and that's why we got into the Kuebix business at the beginning of the year. And if I were to use a customer example we do feel like we're seeing some customers who want to work with us because we can be that one-stop shop because we can bring all these pieces together of the tech stack. 
Colin Rusch: That's super helpful. And just adjacent to that the GM Super Cruise hands-free driving is actually getting pretty good reviews at this point. Can you give us a bit more color on that relationship how deep that is and if some of those reviews are helping open doors for you guys in the automotive market as folks look to push into Level four and Level five ADAS solutions? 
Rob Painter: Well yes I'd start by saying kudos to GM. They've been very good to work with. They've been supportive. And clearly the success they've had in their program has been a catalyst to open doors for us with other automotive OEMs with Tier one suppliers and has also been relevant to opening doors with across the heavy equipment OEMs and markets like construction and agriculture. And sort of the connection point with one of the acquisitions we announced in the third quarter with our positioning services business that was the acquisition that expanded our footprint in North America to now be over size to over one million square miles. And that really is for that to provide that ubiquitous high accuracy high quick convergence time accuracy to the customers. 
Colin Rusch:
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is now open. 
Chad Dillard: So can you just provide a framework for how to think about the bundling opportunities in Building and Infrastructure? How much is bundled today versus where it could go over the next like one to three years? And what do you need to do in terms of distribution strategy to achieve this goal? 
Rob Painter: So I'll start with the -- well there's -- I'd say there's a it happens at the intersection of the product strategy and the go-to-market strategy. So at a product level this is about understanding our market segments understanding our customers understanding that buying persona the user persona. And so when we talk about our Connect & Scale strategy it's very much a customer success strategy customer life cycle customer success strategy. So it's very much driven by that customer persona to understand what the logical bundle of technology is. What we continue to I'll say work on is making that bundle easier to consume. So think of a good better best type framework. Just make it simpler is really a point of emphasis we have on the product side because we clearly do a lot of things. And that can manifest as complexity. I actually think elegance happens through simplicity of that product offering. At the go-to-market level this is -- again if -- you start with the customer segmentation. And so depending on the size of the customer let's take a mid to larger-sized customer opportunity that looks like having one single point of contact for the customers and then having the specialists that are under the wings of that person who owns the account. So we'll have both strategy. We'll have both the reps and partners selling the individual point solutions and then at a key account or strategic account level doing business in a different way. So there's not a one size fits all. So we I'll say position ourselves or manipulate ourselves to meet the opportunity and really meet the customer where they are. 
Chad Dillard: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one thing that definitely stood out to me was just the margins to the positive side for the third quarter. And as we're trying to think through the puts and takes as we go into next year and I recognize you're probably not prepared to give guidance right now, but can you give a framework for thinking about how to think about some of the temporary costs that are coming back next year? And then just from like a margin perspective, do you see like what's in your backlog a mix supportive of similar margin levels that you received this past quarter?
David Barnes: Hey, Chad, it's David. I'll start by saying as you predicted, we're not yet in a position to really give a lot of clear thinking on next year. There's so much uncertainty, but if we start with the framework that the economy is going to grow back and I've seen a lot of projections that say go back in 2021 to where it will be in 2019 whether that's the U.S. or the world. And so we ought to -- hope to at least follow if not beat the overall economic trends. From a margin perspective, the megatrend driving our gross margins better principally is a revenue mix story and that looks to continue. So that will -- ought to support continued improvement at the gross margin level. We will see operating costs grow faster than revenue next year. Some of the cost reductions that we've had this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are not sustainable. We want to be meeting with our customers and some things that are just logistically hard to do. So how do those net out? We'll go into the year planning to try to hold margins at the operating line to close to where they are now with the gross margins going up giving us some cover for the operating expense going up a little bit. But that's just an early framework.
Chad Dillard : That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jason Celino: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One for Rob and this builds on maybe the last question. But you talked about some of the go-to-market changes with your Connect & Scale 2025 initiatives. You talked about one single point of contact for your larger customers and maybe a rep and partner model for your smaller customers. Where does this kind of sit today? And I guess how much more work would you need to do to maybe get to this level?
Rob Painter: Hi, Jason. I mean, I'd have to say that we're in the first or second inning of the nine-inning game. We're definitely early in this journey. And I view that as a good thing, because we're able to get a lot of learnings. Some of the success that we've had thus far, I really see as more of a customer pull than a Trimble push to the customer. So it's really, I'd say, early validation that we're doing the right things when we're just listening to our customers and responding to what they're asking us to do. We have -- we named -- it's been about a year ago we named a Chief Data Officer. And one of the things that I find to be an exciting opportunity is how we can leverage the data at Trimble. Think artificial intelligence, but I mean you could just think of some basic analytics frankly to be able to compare the customers -- the customer sets we have across the different, I'll say, businesses or products and draw the overlapping circles to identify who's already using multiple Trimble solutions and to get a better sense of the bundles that could be logical for customers of a certain type. So just by mining our own data, we think there's a heck of an opportunity to point us that way and I would call that the marketing side of the go-to-market is to mine our own data and point us the way -- use that to point the teams that we talked about in the right direction. Overall, as a reporting segment, we're over on a TTM basis $1.2 billion of revenue in this business. It's a majority software business and we're operating at a scope and scale across serving a variety of stakeholders on a global basis. And we think there's -- I just want to emphasize, I think, there's a really great opportunity within the existing base that we have today not to mention then a strong value proposition to those that we don't serve today.
Jason Celino: Okay, great. And then, next question. It looks like Europe saw some nice improvement in the quarter. But maybe with some regions, maybe going back in the lockdown, can you maybe speak to any more recent trends? Maybe, any positive engagement? And then, do you feel these businesses are better prepared at this time, since we just went through it maybe six months ago?
David Barnes: Hey, Jason, it's David. I'll tell you that what our teams are seeing is while you do see – you do see lockdowns in many countries around Europe they feel different from the first time around. And most of them are accommodating to project work, like what our customers do, that were for a while, sort of, out of operation in the spring. So you never say never, that it might tighten down. But surprisingly, our distributors and our end customers have been remarkably able to do their work even in this second wave.
Jason Celino: Great. No. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: Hi. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone.
Rob Painter: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about the e-Builder and Viewpoint organic growth performance just, so we can see how the businesses performed through the downturn here. And if you could talk about bookings growth and the pipeline. I think, I heard you say Rob, Viewpoint growth reaccelerated. Can you just expand on those points?
Rob Painter: Yes. To give you a couple of data points Jerry, if we look at Viewpoint and e-Builder in combination in the quarter, ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. So, clearly, a nice progression. The net retention in both businesses was over 110%. So, clearly, good results from the businesses there. That's probably the most definitive news I could give you, good news, on the financials, so top line financials of the business. On the bookings side, Q3 was a solid bookings quarter for the construction software businesses. I'll take it -- up-level it in aggregate. It clearly was in the Viewpoint as well. So the recurring ACV is strong double-digits increase. Now some of that, of course, is Q2 business that didn't happen and moving into Q3. So I also want to be careful not to overstate that. But really just nice execution from the teams in those businesses.
Jerry Revich: And nice to hear about SketchUp, posting its second consecutive year of over 50% user growth. One of the big initiatives that you folks have cited over the past call it a year or so, is accelerating the push for the organization towards subscription. Can you talk about how much of the OpEx discussion, David, you spoke about earlier is around your efforts to maybe accelerate that shift into 2021? I bet the numbers that you're seeing from SketchUp and elsewhere in the subscription side are pushing the time line earlier than I think what we probably thought of at the Analyst Day, but maybe you can comment on those items if you don't mind. 
Rob Painter: Well, there is an aspect that pushes earlier than what we talked about at Analyst Day. Clearly, the composition of revenue is ahead of where we talked about at the Analyst Day. And we've had a pandemic that certainly influenced the composition of that as we've seen the recurring revenue perform through. So I would say the context of the moment validates to us that we're heading in the right direction. The secular really I think given a -- creates a tailwind for us. When we talk about Connect & Scale, I've talked more about the Connect side in these calls. On the Scale side, it's important that we look at the systems and the processes that we have across the business. We named a Chief Digital Officer in the third quarter. I'm really happy to have this in place and I think it's going to provide us great leadership across the organization on this journey. We are investing. So when we look at the CapEx spend and you can see that flow through on the free cash flow, clearly, we will put CapEx behind this, because we do need the underlying architecture to enable additional conversions in the business to happen. We need the underlying architecture to enable the -- I'll call it to enable the bundles to transact at a scalable level. So there might -- I think it won't -- while these things I think will happen faster than we talked about at Analyst Day, I also would want to have a little bit of caution in terms of where the slope goes because we need to continue to create the enabling architecture to scale this opportunity.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Jerry.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, everybody. I had a couple of kind of strategic questions, if I may. On the construction side on automation, would you say that you're finding yourself a little bit more in competition with your OEM partner customers or finding yourself as a more valuable partner or maybe some of each as you broaden out your potential reach? That's really my first question, just how that dynamic is shaping up as different people make different investments and facets of automation?
Rob Painter: Hi, Rob. I think it's a little bit of both is the honest answer. And I think you could -- the easiest segmentation happens at the size of the organization. If you're a Tier 2- 3-sized OEM it clearly -- we believe it would clearly make more sense to work with a scaled technology provider then to try and create those investments in-house. And we start always by talking about the mixed fleet. So mixed fleet is so fundamentally important. So an autonomous site isn't going to work if you have proprietary -- multitudes of proprietary equipment running around on a site together not communicating with one another. In fact, when we look at the strategy we have in autonomy, yes, we have positioning technologies and a strategy that's very relevant to the autonomous -- an automated movement of equipment. But that has very little value without a deep understanding of the work that has to be carried out. So we think that by understanding the physical world in which these machine operates that we have the ability to develop the optimal plans for the tasks at hand and to really be that brain for the site or the farm. And we think that that's a really important aspect of the Trimble strategy. So to be that operational center for the mixed fleet is an important aspect of the strategy. And then -- and then when we get into the tech stack, what we've talked about for years is machine control and guidance that we do in civil construction what we call steering and guidance in agriculture. We call it automation. Well that's autonomy. It's sort of between Level 1 and Level 2 autonomy. And we keep working up that automation spectrum towards Level 3. We look at specific workflows that will make sense, machine types and workflows that would lend themselves to an autonomous work situation that will make sense. And then we think we've got a full spectrum of cloud perception, optimization and control technologies that are relevant here.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you. Fascinating area. The other question I'm sorry for the clarification, but for the decision you made in transport that -- the decisions and inventory write-down to the extent you're able, can you just clarify you exiting product lines anyway? Are you exiting just a product and replacing it? And then just how do you feel about customer traction there and ability to sort of ramp back up with truck production? Thanks. I’ll stop.
David Barnes: Hey, Rob, it's David Barnes. So as you look at the revenue line you can see that the volume of business we're serving is going down. So the restructuring in part simply recognizes that the business has contracted and smaller than it was. A lot of the strategy we're working through to improve customer retention and customer satisfaction is about streamlining the product offering, replacing old technology with more supportable technologies going forward. So when you support fewer platforms, you need less resource over time. The inventory write-down specifically was about products that were committed to when the business was bigger and more healthy and we've worked through our strategy with regard to customer targeting and pricing. And we've recognized that the inventory valuation -- we've updated it to reflect that plan. So we're not – we haven't exited any businesses per se. We're optimizing the business that we've got and as Rob said, aiming for the inflection point where on all the key metrics of ARR and revenue growth and margins we can get momentum toward what a good business looks like in Trimble in the second half of next year.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. So for clarity you're not like exiting a kind of business you're just I don't know if 80-20 is the right way to state it for you guys, but trying to serve the customers with a less diverse product set or such and that's what led to the right time.
David Barnes: No that's right. No we haven't exited any business. We're still serving the customers' needs just doing it more efficiently with products that are fit for the future.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Blake Gendron: Yes. Hi, thanks. Thanks for squeezing on here. So I wanted to follow up on subscription transition talk and just get a better idea for on a relative basis where B&I is in that transition relative to the software aspects of your other segments. And then digging into B&I, specifically I was wondering if you have noticed any interplay between the subscription transition and maybe the size of the customers that are signing on, presumably get the large customers to sign on first that drives some of the subscription transition and then by network effect some of the smaller stakeholders start to sign on as well and maybe that accelerates the transition further. Are you noticing any sort of interplay there? 
Rob Painter: So I'll start with B&I and where we think we are on the software transition. I would describe that more in middle innings maybe early middle innings on the software transition. In Transportation, I would say we're in the probably solid middle innings on that business maybe in the late middle innings on that one. Our enterprise business which is the back-office software, we are executing a transition to a subscription model in that business. The rest of the businesses really already are subscription and Transportation. So that's a little further ahead mathematically than B&I would be. I'd say Geospatial is a very small aspect of it. So it might be early but it's a lower dollar amount. And then the Resources and Utilities reasonably far along. And one of the strategies we have Blake is also looking at hardware businesses and rethinking the business models on some of those. So while you're asking about software I just also want to comment that I think if we take the civil construction business we launched what we call Trimble Platform-as-a-Service in the quarter and that's a new way to monetize the business, where think of it as a bundle of the machine control hardware with the software with ongoing support and service providing technology assurance for the customer. So we can upgrade functionality over the lifetime of that. So we're really taking a fresh look at all the business models we have. And then when you ask about the interplay with subscriptions and customer sizes, the one that we talk about the most is actually at the owner level. And our belief set is that if we can – when the owners and I'll say, some of it's hearts and minds and some of it is the owner business that we have whether that's a Department of Transportation or the owners that – the capital programs that we manage through our e-Builder business, where we manage hundreds of billions of dollars of committed construction volume, we see that as a mechanism or a catalyst to promote the use of technology into the field. And then at some level I guess you could say once you've done that you could look at the general contractors as the catalyst win the GC, win the subcontractor and think about the waterfall as such.
Blake Gendron: Really appreciate the answer there. And one follow-up if I could just on M&A. Any portfolio gaps in B&I that exist, particularly in light of the WorksOS launch, which seems pretty compelling? And then could you maybe contextualize the divestiture of the construction Logistics business in light of WorksOS? Is it that you're trying to focus more on the owner or contract or subcontractor and maybe away from the smaller inputs in the stakeholder chain? Or what was sort of the strategic driver behind that? 
Rob Painter: I'll start with the divestiture of the construction logistics business. It's a business we've had for a long time. It was arguably our first foray into telematics many years ago. From -- I'll say from a financial standpoint or maybe even a governance standpoint, I think as management we're paid to allocate capital efficiently. And when we look at how to allocate capital in the construction logistics business, it was a business that's reasonably concentrated and penetrated.  And we felt that when we look at the landscape of it that it was -- its future was best served to be part of Command Alkon was the buyer. It's the future of the business and therefore I think the future of the individuals who work in the business. And we wish that business great success. It's better served combined with Command Alkon.  So I think, we at a strategic level to allocate capital optimally either needed to be a buyer or a seller. And the nature of the market was such that we thought it was better to be a seller on the construction logistics business. It doesn't change the conviction of our view on the connected strategy nor as a signal of a shift of any intent whatsoever.  And then you asked on the acquisition side, I would -- rather than maybe be specific about where we might see gaps, I would say we think about making acquisitions that advance our Connect & Scale strategic imperative. So on the connect side, we certainly look across that life cycle and across the stakeholders and we'll think about where we have additional opportunities to serve.  In many cases that may be tuck-in and there's businesses out there. There's a long tail of activity in construction tech that -- I'll say construction tech businesses which arguably are -- their long-term futures to be a feature inside of a larger company such as Trimble. So there could be some aspects of that that really help us tighten the workflow or bring additional data elements that are -- that we think could be compelling. So that's how we think about the acquisition side. 
Blake Gendron: Understood. Really appreciate the comment. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
James Faucette: Great. Thanks. I just want to follow up quickly on the M&A commentary Rob as well as just the product portfolio. Where are we from divestitures and examination of the portfolio standpoint? Is there more to be done there? How do you feel like you're looking now? And as far as the acquisitions et cetera -- the acquisitions that you are doing, you would think about doing is there -- are they largely in kind of the business and pricing model that you want to get to already? Or is there going to be some transition period do you think for a lot of them as you pull them into the business? 
Rob Painter: Let me start on the divestiture question and I'll probably have to ask you to repeat the acquisition one. I didn't quite make all of that out. On the divestiture side, we continue to look at the portfolio. And so if the axes -- if the two axes are strategic fit and financial performance we have a point of view of our own portfolio. The time has to be right for us and I'd say a potential buyer. I don't want to signal that there's, major trunks or branches of the Trimble business that wouldn't be there. I just think we're doing the right -- we'll go back to my comment about -- I think we're paid to allocate capital efficiently and effectively. And we're looking at the -- in the context of the opportunities that we see in front of us, in construction and agriculture, transportation, and our core survey business, where do we have opportunities to continue to win, to gain a relative market share, and to effectively execute the strategy. And where -- if we feel, in any of those that we're in a suboptimal position okay well that would certainly say something about strategic fit. I just want to say, we are being diligent in the exercise. It's an ongoing effort. And I think it's something that we should always be on an ongoing basis, be looking at. So that's a divestiture answer, but I missed the acquisition question.
James Faucette: Sorry, I wasn't clear there. I was just asking, if the acquisitions that you are doing or looking at, are those businesses already kind of in subscription model structure, in terms of go-to-market. Or are there likely to be transition periods to move them over to that et cetera, especially where it makes sense?
Rob Painter: Okay. Got it. That's fair. Good question. I'd say that could look like two flavors. One would be I would call it, a software-centric acquisition. And the second would be really more, autonomy related. And the more autonomy ones, from an accounting perspective, are likely to show up in hardware. Now how they monetize over time okay, that we'll say remains to be seen. So those would be the two vectors that we think about James. And on -- for the software ones, we don't have a dogma that says it has to be a subscription business already, all things equal, that's a good thing. All things equal, if it's already in a transition, that's better than not being in one at all. But we don't make that a, hard cutoff criteria for acquisition screening.
James Faucette: Great. Thanks a lot.
Rob Painter: Thanks, James.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to our presenters, for any closing remarks.
Michael Leyba: Thank you very much everyone for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Trimble Second Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today’s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker for today Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Rob Painter: Good afternoon everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Despite difficult circumstances in the second quarter, our team rose to the occasion. I’m deeply grateful for the ingenuity and commitment to outcomes demonstrated by my colleagues and our worldwide network of partners over these last few months. What I said on our call in May remains true today. That is, we will get through this crisis. We are well-positioned to endure the macroeconomic shock. And we will emerge stronger on the other side of this. Our belief in our long-term strategy remains undiminished. Slide two lists the five key messages we want to convey today. First, our resilience, the quality of our strategy and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the second quarter. ARR, at $1.21 billion, adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.7% and deferred revenue at $531 million were clear highlights. Our shift to a more hardware connected, software-centric, and recurring revenue business model is paying off. Second, the decisive financial and strategic actions we took in March have put us in a position to restore employee pay as of August and senior executive pay shortly thereafter. I thank all my colleagues for their professionalism and demonstrated commitment. These last few months have strengthened our culture. Third, we take our responsibility to address racial injustice and climate change seriously. Speaking personally, I have a heightened sense of awareness that has strengthened my resolve to leverage our platform to lead Trimble to a different place. We have been public in our stance against racial injustice. We established a diversity equity and inclusion working group, representing both senior leadership in Trimble as well as advocates appointed from within the organization. We have also donated money through our Trimble Foundation to causes that align with our values and we remain humbled to know that we have a lot more to do. With respect to climate change, we are pleased to have named Leah Lambertson, our Head of Operations, to a larger role where she now has additional responsibility as Head of Sustainability for Trimble. Fourth, we reiterate our focus to execute on our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We will balance cost containment and investment in innovation during the downturn. We are connecting the industry lifecycles we serve such as construction, agriculture, utilities, and the transportation supply chain. By reporting segment, in a context of unprecedented conditions, we were satisfied with our progress in the quarter in three of our four segments. While we remain convinced of both the long-term market opportunity of our supply chain strategy as well as the viability of our strategy, we are currently performing below our potential in our Transportation segment. Earlier in the year, I set expectations of demonstrable financial recovery in the beginning of 2021. Given the environment and circumstances, we now believe the recovery will take longer than anticipated. In addition to the difficult macro and pandemic effects, which have suppressed demand, there are three discrete topics that impact our near-term results in Transportation. First, our acquisition of Kuebix, as we announced in February, remains strategically important but is currently dilutive. Kuebix takes us to the shipper market, which is key to our connected supply chain strategy. Second, we continue to execute a subscription business model transition in our enterprise business; and in our mobility business we launched a Hardware-as-a-Service offering. We have high conviction on these model transitions. Third, we continue to work through our Electronic Logging Device (ELD) product delivery commitments in our mobility business and are offering incentive programs to customers to upgrade older technology. Overall, we will take near-term actions to enhance our competitive position and will measure the success of our actions by delivering profitable ARR growth, enterprise bookings, and by growing the size and transaction volume in the shipper community. We are pleased that in our other three segments, Buildings and Infrastructure delivered solid ARR growth, offset by expected disruptions in our hardware sales and new perpetual software bookings. While we see projects coming back online, we also see uncertainty into 2021 for new projects and we are closely monitoring the impact of stimulus measures. Geospatial did an exceptional job managing expenses and finding available revenue opportunities in the quarter. And Resources and Utilities was led by growth in our Utilities business and positioning services business, and by relatively positive performance in the aftermarket agriculture business. Our fifth and last point, while short-term market uncertainty remains high, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We see green shoots in many of our markets and we believe the second quarter will mark the bottom of our revenue decline. Nevertheless, uncertainty prevails, and we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance for the balance of the year. I will turn the call over now to David to take us through the numbers.
David Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let’s start on slide three, with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $735 million, down 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation subtracted 1%, and acquisitions and divestitures added 2%, for a total organic revenue decrease of 15%. Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by improved revenue mix. The introduction of higher margin new products and lower discounting also had a positive impact.  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, driven both by improvements in gross margin and strong cost control. Operating income margins also expanded 260 basis points to 23.1%. Net income dollars decreased by 2% on a year-over-year basis, while earnings per share fell by $0.01 to $0.52 per share. Moving to slide four, our second quarter cash flow from operations was $147 million, demonstrating the strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $135 million. We paid down over $140 million of debt in the quarter and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 2.2 times. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.2 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $200 million in cash. In addition, we have no scheduled principal payments on our debt until July 2022. Our access to liquidity therefore remains strong. Given our strong and improving capital structure we are open to acquisition opportunities that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. We anticipate continued prioritization of debt reduction in the allocation of free cash flow, but will consider a modest return to share repurchases. Now, turning to slide five that highlight some of the key metrics we are following. First, I want to note that we have redefined our ARR metric. ARR now includes the annualized revenue of term licenses. Under GAAP the revenue from term licenses is recognized upfront rather than ratably, and for that reason, term licenses are excluded from the recurring revenue line that we report each quarter. But term licenses are renewable and recurring in nature and therefore share the fundamental economic characteristics of subscriptions. So, we believe that including term licenses in our ARR definition provides a more complete picture of our recurring business. Note that with this change, we have restated the ARR measure in prior periods, and that information is available in the financial summary document on our Investor Relations website. ARR was $1.21 billion in the second quarter and grew 6% versus prior year. Organic growth of ARR was 3%. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, represents approximately 1% of revenue on a trailing twelve months basis, demonstrating the working capital efficiency of our business. Through this period of proactive cost management we have continued to invest in key growth initiatives. One indicator of our investment posture can be seen in our R&D spending. Our trailing twelve months R&D is nearly 15% of revenue, and we believe our focus on innovation will enable us to emerge from this recession stronger than we entered it. Finally, I’ll note progress against two metrics that point to the health of our business going forward. Deferred revenue is up 17% versus the end of the second quarter a year ago, and our backlog ended the second quarter at $1.2 billion, also up from the level of a year ago. As a reminder, backlog represents contractual commitments that will be recognized as revenue in the future. Most of the backlog represents the unrecognized value of subscription and maintenance agreements, but it also includes over $200 million from non-recurring revenue businesses. We expect the substantial majority of that backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months. Both of these metrics give us enhanced visibility into our revenue trends in the coming quarters. Moving to slide six, I’ll elaborate a bit on Rob’s earlier comments about the increasing diversity and resilience of our revenue base. Recurring revenues made up 39% of total Trimble revenue in the quarter, and grew by over 4% even in an extraordinarily difficult economic environment. Of our major sources of recurring revenue, only Transportation saw a decline in the quarter, for reasons Rob mentioned earlier. Our other major sources of recurring revenue including Viewpoint, e-Builder, Building Construction Software and positioning services collectively saw recurring revenue growth of greater than 10% in the second quarter. These offerings are essential to the continued operation of our customers’ businesses even in the toughest of times. By contrast, our non-recurring revenues, including hardware, perpetual software, and professional services, experienced meaningful year-on-year declines in the second quarter. These businesses were adversely impacted by project suspensions, OEM factory shutdowns, and restricted access to our clients’ facilities. While many of these restrictions eased late in the second quarter, our overall non-recurring business remains meaningfully below year-ago levels as we enter the third quarter. Looking at geography, the results in the quarter were largely correlated with impacts from COVID in terms of shutdowns and the pace of reopening. The COVID-related dynamics in North America and Europe were similar, with business conditions very poor in April and improving through the quarter. North America was down 17% and Europe was down 13%, with a significant difference being North America’s higher weighting in the Transportation segment. Asia-Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 1%. Rest of World was down 19%, driven principally by difficult business conditions in Brazil and the weakening of the Brazilian currency. Turning now to slide seven, we take a deeper look at each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was down 12% on an organic basis. Recurring revenue growth was particularly strong in Viewpoint, e-Builder and SketchUp. Hardware, perpetual software license, and professional services revenues were down greater than 20% in the quarter. Segment margins expanded 400 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost reductions. Geospatial revenue was down 11% on an organic basis, with non-recurring revenue down in the mid-teens and recurring revenue experiencing growth. Margins were up 680 basis points. Resources and Utilities revenue was down 13% on an organic basis. Growth from the Utilities business, including Cityworks, helped offset some of the decline in agriculture revenue. Margin expansion of 440 basis points was driven by improved revenue mix and cost reductions. Transportation revenue was down 24% on an organic basis and margins declined 710 basis points. The adverse trends in the Transportation segment were driven by the factors Rob mentioned earlier. Turning to slide eight and the outlook for the third quarter, we continue to face significant uncertainty in the demand trends in our core markets driven by the risk of COVID-related restrictions and the broader impact of the pandemic on the economy. Therefore, we lack the visibility in the business that is needed to put forth a guidance range. However, I can provide some color on trends that we are seeing in our business and the markets we serve. Overall, we expect that revenue in the third quarter will be down on a year-over-year basis, albeit at a rate of decline more moderate than we experienced in the second quarter. We anticipate that revenues in the Resources and Utilities segment will grow in the third quarter versus prior year due to the relative resilience of these end markets, the fact that we are comparing against a tough 2019, and the addition of Cityworks. We project that revenue in both the Buildings and Infrastructure and Geospatial segments will be below prior year. The Transportation segment will experience the greatest revenue declines in the third quarter, driven by the same factors, which adversely impacted second quarter performance. Looking at our trends by revenue type, we anticipate continued growth in recurring revenues due to the resilience of these offerings and the ongoing conversions to subscriptions across our software businesses. By contrast, our non-recurring revenues are likely to continue to decline in the third quarter, albeit at a slower rate than we experienced in the second quarter. We expect gross margins to continue their expansion on a year-over-year basis due to increased software mix, although we don’t expect that gross margins will remain as strong as we experienced in the second quarter. Turning to operating expense, note that spending in the second quarter was extraordinarily low across our business. We anticipate that operating expense will be higher in the third quarter than in the second quarter. We estimate that the revenue and margin dynamics will result in year- over-year decremental margins in the mid-30s. I’ll add here that we remain committed to maintaining healthy operating margins going into 2021. Our view is that 2021 will be characterized by only slow and gradual economic recovery. We continue to evaluate our business portfolio and look to exit those businesses which are peripheral to our strategy or don’t meet our financial objectives. In terms of cash, we expect cash flow to be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half due to the drop in revenue and EBITDA. Nevertheless, we continue to expect operating cash flow will exceed non-GAAP net income for the full year, and we expect slightly lower capital expenditures for the year. Now, I’ll turn it back to Rob.
Rob Painter: Let me close by talking about key elements of Connect & Scale 2025 and our progress in the quarter, which I will describe in four elements. First, connecting solutions across our industry lifecycles; two examples here. In Transportation, we announced further integration with Kuebix between shippers and the Trimble carrier network. In construction, we press released a win with SNCF in France to manage railway construction assets and building construction data. Second, delivering breakout innovation that connects the physical and digital worlds. We launched a couple of analytics offerings in our construction business, leveraging our content and project jobsite data to enable customers to optimize project delivery. Near and dear to me, the Government of Nepal completed fieldwork for measuring Mt. Everest’s height using Trimble GNSS equipment. Third, accelerating our business model transformation. In Transportation, we began offering hardware as part of subscription bundles. In our Utilities business, we announced an IoT Solutions-as-a-Service offering for remote monitoring of water and wastewater infrastructure. And here in the third quarter, we will introduce our machine control Platform-as-a-Service initiative, which we announced earlier in the year at ConExpo. Fourth, we are taking actions that enable us to efficiently and effectively scale our business. We divested a small seismic business in the quarter, we have shrunk our real estate office footprint by 30 offices year-to-date, and we have increased our spend and focus on our digital fulfillment systems initiative. With that, I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to be with us today and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let’s please go to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ann Duignan: Yes. Hi, good afternoon everybody. Just a couple of clarifications. You ran through the Q3 guidance so quickly, I find myself scrambling. Could you restate what you said about your expectations for ARR into Q3 versus nonrecurring revenue? And then putting all the pieces together, given lower gross margin, lower -- higher operating expense, would you expect adjusted earnings to be down quarter-over-quarter in Q3? 
David Barnes: Hi Ann, David Barnes. So, yes, we expect ARR to continue to grow in the back half of the year and in the third quarter, because those businesses are resilient and the conversions continue. Non-recurring revenues will be down, so that results in the total being down lower than -- but not down as much as in Q2. Gross margins probably won't come in, in Q3 as good as Q2. Operating expense will go up a little bit. So, Ann, we're not certainly signaling increasing dollars operating profit. 
Ann Duignan: And why would you expect gross margins to be down in Q3 if ARR is going to continue to grow?
David Barnes: Well, gross margins will be up year-on-year for a lot of reasons, none big, but many cumulative. As you've seen, Q2 was a very high gross margin period. So, we do think gross margins will be above prior year, but probably not higher than Q2.
Ann Duignan: Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the Transportation side, could you just dig into that segment a little bit more and tell us what do you think is are cyclical issues versus are there any structural issues that we need to be concerned about? I mean, ELD has been a weight on Transportation for a while now. How should we think about that maybe beyond this year and into 2021? 
Rob Painter: Hi Ann, this is Rob. So, when I think about the macro of the end markets we serve, I would say, transportation, particularly -- specifically North America, transportation is certainly the most challenged at the moment. There is, I think, as you know, a supply/demand imbalance, which is creating pricing pressure on the carriers. And that actually started in 2019 and was playing through to the beginning of the year. I think the market probably expected balance to come back there on the pricing side and then the pandemic set that back. So, I look at the macro backdrop in transportation and I put at least half of the delta to that macro backdrop and that also includes trucking companies idling some assets. And so if you're idling some assets that could have adverse impact on our units serving those trucking companies, at least in the near-term. So, let's say, a view forward for some quarters or the couple of quarters or maybe the next year. So, that exists that backdrop. And then just to reiterate a couple of points from the prepared remarks. In our Enterprise business, so the back office software or transportation management system, we are intentionally engaging in a model transition, so moving from perpetual to a subscription offering. And that is emphatically the right thing to do for the business, for the market, for the customers, and as we all know, has short-term negative impacts to the P&L. So, we're offering -- we are offering both models, and we're seeing almost two-thirds - actually, it's above thirds of our new bookings are coming from subscription offering. So, the more we're driving that subscription offering, the subscription bookings, that does create a near-term -- a near-term drag. And then the last bit I talked about was the Kuebix acquisition, which takes us to the shipper side of the transportation market, which was when we announced it in February, we did announce it as a dilutive deal. So that hangs heavier in a market that is down. So, those are the majority factors. And then yes, we also talked about ELD itself and continuing to work our customers through the migration. And now Canada ELD comes after the U.S.
Ann Duignan: And the ELD issue should be resolved by end of this year? And then I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Yes, I think it would be fair to say that from the end of this year and I mean it will probably bleed into the beginning of next year as well, working through those -- working through our product commitments.
Ann Duignan: Okay. Thank you. In the interest of time, I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Rob Painter: Thanks Ann.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon everyone.
Rob Painter: Hey Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could just update us on the performance of e-Builder and Viewpoint since you folks -- ownership. Can you just talk about the growth in logos that you folks have delivered? What kind of win rate for new logos has the team delivered? Can you just frame the performance for us over the past year plus and especially over the past quarter?
Rob Painter: Yes. And for those who may not know, Viewpoint and e-Builder are two acquisitions from a couple of years ago that are in our Buildings and Infrastructure space. They continue to perform very well. So, very pleased with the respective management teams and what they're delivering since they've been a part of Trimble. To give you a bit of quantitative to overlay that qualitative. In the second quarter, ARR grew in the mid-teens for both of those businesses. So, I would say that's emphatic demonstration of the strategy working and the business model working. When we look at new logos that those businesses have driven in the last couple of years. If we look at e-Builder, about two-thirds of the ARR growth has been through new logos. So, it's also a good sign of driving new growth since being part of Trimble. And then on the Viewpoint side, it's been about one-third new logo and two-thirds from existing customers, and that makes sense because we are transitioning the model there to a subscription model, whereas e-Builder was already a subscription model. And then to connect the dots to that, if you look at new logo wins, it's around our RFP type win ratios, they're around 50%. And the majority of times when we don't get a deal, it's from a no decision. So, hopefully, that gives you some color, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I appreciate it, Rob. And then what stood out was the growth in deferred revenue this quarter, was that because bookings were stronger than ARR? Can you talk about that or was there any acquisition impact in the quarter?
David Barnes: Yes, there is some acquisition impact in there, Jerry, but the bigger portion of that is the ARR growth and the health of the recurring businesses, both subscriptions and maintenance and support.
Jerry Revich: And then it was nice to hear about two-thirds of the Transportation back office customers signing up for the subscription offerings. Can you talk about growth in the addressable market that you're seeing? Obviously, not a lot of orders in April, but I'm wondering any conclusions that we could draw from what's going on in June, July in terms of how much the subscription offering is helping you folks expand the tail, so to speak?
Rob Painter: Yes, it's a good question. What we can see and what we've learned from other businesses where we've made the transition is it certainly does expand the addressable market. I'll use our SketchUp business and construction as an example, and we had another quarter of over 50% year-on-year unit growth. And that, to me, is a tremendous sign of -- and a clear sign of expanding the addressable market. If we look at Transportation, the fundamentals there would be taking us predominantly from the larger carriers into the medium-size carriers who are not going to want to have a, call it, a custom implementation. So, they're going to want more of a standard configuration out of the box offering. So, there's a logic to it. And so we do see ourselves reaching a set of customers that we weren't reaching before. But I'd also say that the largest subscription bookings we've had in the last, I think it was three quarters, was from a very large carrier. So it does seem to be attractive to both segments. 
Jerry Revich: Appreciate the discussion. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital. 
Jason Celino: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. To build off the subscription offerings, it sounds like you also announced another as a service offering for your Utility segment. But for those two new announcements you made, what's been kind of the feedback from customers? And then for those particular products, how should we think of pace of kind of the -- that transition? 
Rob Painter: Sure. I'd say it's pretty early days to give a quantitative view of how they are performing in the market. I can say qualitatively, they were customer-driven initiatives that we made to make the move to the subscription, the subscription offering. And I use them as an example to show really, across the board at Trimble that we're looking to the business model conversion.  I mean, one, in a down market, we all know moving from CapEx to OpEx has a financial advantage. We talked on the last question about the expansion of the addressable market that we believe that we can see through this. And then there's the pursuit of our -- the connect part of the Connect & Scale strategy. being able to connect the data, being able to connect stakeholders across the industry continuums, we really believe in the pursuit of the strategy that to connect the data, which is really where we think there's huge optionality going forward as you connect the data a business model transition and is an enabler to be able to get data back to the cloud. And so there's both strategic and financial reasons that have us very motivated and committed to this. And so yes, I was wanting to show examples from parts of the company, you don't often hear us talking about or elements such as hardware of changing the business model that we haven't talked about before as signals of just how serious we are about this. So, time will tell on customer pickup and so we can certainly come back to that in future calls. 
Jason Celino: Okay, great. And one quick follow-up, if I can. A lot of other software companies have been talking about their customers accelerating different digital investments. Was the strength in Viewpoint and e-Builder this quarter due to that or why couldn't the construction end market see this also?
Rob Painter: I have to say, you're very faint. It's hard to hear you, so I missed the question. 
Jason Celino: Okay. Let me try to speak a little louder. A lot of other software companies are talking about customers accelerating different digital investments. Was the strength in the quarter from Viewpoint and e-Builder due to that? And then why couldn't the construction end market see that also?
Rob Painter: Got you. Well, for sure, at a secular level, we believe there's an acceleration of digital. And it's and you look at what we do as Trimble, the connection of the physics solutions that connect the physical and the digital worlds, and really the in essence, we're digitizing markets such as construction, agriculture, transportation. So, we believe at a secular level that we're in the right place. We've seen some of the -- I'll use Viewpoint as an example, some of the acceleration in that ARR. And then the bookings we had this quarter were customers who had on-prem -- on-prem software, weren't able to get connectivity they wanted. And so we actually did some lift and shifts during the quarter to help our customers. And that has a side benefit of course, once they've seen how the software operates in the cloud, we've seen them, by and large, want to stick to that delivery method. Now, in the short-term, we have the disruptions of being able to actually access customers. And so I would separate the very near-term from the mid to long-term in terms of the digitization secular. So long-term, I think it's there. In the short-term, new logos have certainly been harder to reach from the new bookings that we've had. And again, that has a certain logic to it. And we saw new bookings trends in the quarter and the second quarter move from quite negative at the beginning of the quarter and progressively move better through until the end of the quarter and here into July. So, hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color how we see it on both sides. 
Jason Celino: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you, operator. Hi guys. Rob, just following on your last answer there. I think you're through the quarter progress on new logos or new customers was construction related. Transportation obviously had a tough quarter. Could you talk about the non-hardware side through the quarter there? And whether there's any of that similar digital push really taking hold?
Rob Painter: And you mean specifically in transportation, Rob?
Rob Wertheimer: Correct. 
Rob Painter: In our -- in the Enterprise Business, we saw bookings progress better throughout the quarter. Well look, that's software -- software-oriented, of course, in the enterprise business. I would say a bright spot there. I think if we look at the -- kind of elevate back a second, when we look at some of the macros, which I know you know well, whether it's truckload line haul indices or shipment indexes or Class eight unit sales, those were all pretty negative in the quarter, maybe even historically negative. Now, by the end of the quarter in June, it looks like those indices may have bottomed. We saw spot rates increase. If you look -- compare April to July, Class orders were up in June. And so if we see that freight demand coming back, then let's -- we feel like the market's got at least an incrementally better backdrop than it did in the first couple of months of Q2.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. And if I can just ask maybe a different one, but you took a really prudent approach to this economy, which is highly uncertain. How is your appetite, if an acquisition appears? I mean, do you feel like that just is on hold because, who knows how the world works out over the next year or so? Or is Trimble actively looking? I mean, what's your current feeling on willingness to do that? Thanks.
Rob Painter: Sure. Well, from a financial perspective -- a financial strength perspective, you look at the net debt to EBITDA, and we're in a strong and healthy position. You know the working capital was less than 1% of revenue in the quarter, producing strong cash flow, over $500 million of deferred revenue on the books. So, we have the financial wherewithal to pursue an acquisition. If I move to the -- that's a financial answer. From a strategic perspective, it really is a function of not pursuing acquisitions for the sake of acquisitions, but really in the pursuit of executing the strategies. And so what I would signal is that we have an openness to it, but it's also not meant to be a signal that you're about to hear something meaningful or big, given what we -- the commentary we had in the last call about pulling back on acquisitions and buyback. We just wanted to be transparent that given where we see ourselves now and we saw Q2 as the trough of the revenue decline, that we would be open. And so we are open in the context of, particularly, I'd say, in the construction space, number one, in the overall segment. Secondarily, would be, I'd probably say in the agriculture space, but there's not actually really too many deals, I would say, to be done in that space.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Can you give some more granular sense of what you're seeing in construction? I really love to get a sense of public projects versus private projects as well as buildings versus infrastructure. We've seen some softening in June and July. Just would love to get some color on that from you guys as you move into 3Q.
Rob Painter: Sure, hi Colin. So, if we look at -- I would break it down by type of projects on one dimension and the other current and future. And the punchline is we see current work coming back online, and much of it never went offline and what went offline has, by and large, come back online. And then from a future perspective, we see customers with some concern about the 2021 pipeline. And we're all watching to see what happens with infrastructure, what happens with the FAST Act, will that get renewed in September, or will it be continuing resolution, that pushes that out, what will be -- will there be a backstop on state DoT funding or there's a number of factors that are impacting the view on the future that hopefully get resolved here shortly. If I then look at the type of construction, let's take residential, non-residential and civil, I would say, non-residential, the data would show that's been hit the hardest. And if we look at civil, that's been impacted by about half of what the non-res numbers have been impacted by. And so when we look at the segments that we serve across the value chain and construction, if we looked at a market such as architecture and design, we would look at the ABI data and ABI data would tell us that the number of the June stabilized after the April, May decline. So, that does look more positive. Now, multi-residentials look more positive than commercial and industrial, which, again, that also makes sense. And I would note that in our SketchUp business, we grew units over 50% year-over-year. So it didn't play into -- whatever the number was, that didn't play into our business. And if we look at general contractors in that segment, we can see from our own systems because we can see how our customers are at a macro or meta level, we can see how the systems are being used, and we can see the current activity is solid, and we can see that project backlogs are currently down. And then if we look at owners and occupiers of that we serve or occupiers of buildings, where we serve occupiers of buildings, they're looking to be more efficient with their space management, and that fits nicely with one of the technologies that we have to help you manage space more efficiently. So, that historically is a business that's grown the most during down markets. In our e-Builder business, we've seen verticals such as data centers or government have been good. And of course, markets like retail are not good. So, it differs within the segments. And then civil, again, we're watching to see what happens with the project starts and with the project bids. And that's an answer in the U.S. But if you go around the world, you see places or places like in the U.K., HS2 has come back or was greenlighted and is back to work, and we've seen some good performance in a few other markets outside of the U.S. as well.
Colin Rusch: That's incredibly helpful. Thank you. Just a follow-up just briefly on customer engagement through the pandemic response, are you seeing more of your non-software customers showing interest in discussing some of the enterprise solutions? And I'm just trying to get a sense of that migration and how much of that is even more of a push effort and how much is a pull effort from the customers?
Rob Painter: Well, one indicator, especially when we have our SaaS businesses, we can measure the intensity of the usage of the software and at the beginning of the quarter in Q2, not surprisingly, we saw large dips from late March into April. And then we saw -- and we've seen since then, quite intensive usage. And that's important for us. It also plays through by the way, through the net retention we've seen in ratio and a number of the software businesses. And hey, I think maybe the work at home is positively impacting the usage of the system because we have remote access to be able to continue to do the work. In terms of engaging new customers, I mean, like most companies -- or all companies, we're certainly shifting the nature of digital engagement and how we reach customers and we're all learning new ways of sales and marketing. And I'd say, so far, we've seen some really nice pockets of success. I'll give you one example. In Brazil, we did a virtual trade show a few months ago that had 3,000 attendees. And we would never get 3,000 attendees in an in-person demonstration, and we did it for a couple of thousand dollars. I mean, that's an incredible ROI from a digitally engaged. I will say on some of the hardware solutions, there are aspects of seeing is believing and the ability to be out there in the field is important. Now, there, we luckily have a worldwide network of dealer partners and our hardware predominant businesses. And they have been up and running. And really, while it's still difficult, let's say, to operate in the restricted environments, that's fundamentally different than if we were having -- if that was all direct sales, and we had to be on airplanes to do it because we wouldn't be able to be out there. So, having that channel in the hardware business is proving at the moment to be, yet again, very positive for us.
Colin Rusch: Thank you so much.
Operator: And your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, thank you. Thanks for the question. Rob, could we just talk for a second about the op profit in B&I and Geospatial. What I'm kind of looking at is, in B&I, the op profit was up $25 million quarter-to-quarter on flat sales, so from Q1 to Q2? And Geospatial was kind of plus $8 million op profit on flat sales in Geospatial. And is that -- could you just perhaps suggest to us or give us some feel for what the cost takeout or just cost control did sequentially versus the mix there?
Rob Painter: Well, if we look at the costs, and David can add on to this, as you know, we did the pay reductions in the quarter. But actually, if we look at the fundamental drivers of the cost delta in the business, we saw travel and entertainment was the largest drop, not surprisingly and that was across the board. We saw things like health care expenses go significantly down, not surprising. People weren't going to the doctor. So, those played in to the overall numbers. So, now if we're looking specifically within the reporting segments, okay. So, there are some nuances there. And I think you're asking, Rick, about ND&I compared to Geospatial OpEx, the sequential down Q1 to Q2?
Richard Eastman: Yes, I just again, I'm just looking at the dollar increase in op profit versus the revenue being flat quarter-to-quarter? And it's pretty substantial in the B&I business, $25 million more in profit on flat sales from Q1 to Q2. And obviously, there would be a cost component to that. But again, quite frankly, I'm just thinking for modeling purposes. As we move forward, we have more of a software recurring revenue mix there. I would think year-over-year, certainly, but sequentially, it's a rather significant increase in op profit.
Rob Painter: Yes. And there's an element that's going to play through with the gross margins being higher, so on -- even on flat revenue, that's going to be a help in both of the businesses. And then after -- and there's about an 800 bps delta in the gross margins between those segments. And then from an OpEx point of view, David, do you want to add to that?
David Barnes: Yes, I'll just add to what Rob said. So, we -- obviously, for the whole company, gross margins went up Q1 to Q2 and up year-on-year. And that's more pronounced in Buildings and Infrastructure, where the hardware pieces of the business were weaker and the software were stronger for all the factors Rob mentioned. But that phenomenon occurred in Geospatial as well. We had a really positive revenue mix. So, what you're seeing on the operating margin line in those two segments is the positive confluence of improved gross margins year-on-year and meaningful reductions in operating expenditure across every category. It's people, no one went to the doctor, travel basically was zero, as I'm sure is true in many of your companies and really across the board, operating expense was low. So, as we indicated, the operating expense levels, as you think forward and after Q2, they can't be sustained at that low level. So they will gradually go up, albeit not to the pre-pandemic levels.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Okay. And then just a second question on the BIM business, could you just characterize how Europe performed in the BIM business in the quarter?
Rob Painter: Really quite similar to the Rest of the World. I wouldn't say there's anything that particularly stood out in Europe. And we do have a bit more of a Nordic and a U.K. concentration. Nordic did better, not surprisingly.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg. Your line is open.
Andrew DeGasperi: Thank you. I just wanted to ask a question, again, on transportation, particularly the weakness. Could you maybe elaborate if any of that was due to competition? We know that Samsara has been particularly aggressive. I'm just wondering if that played a role in the weak -- in the downtick in revenues.
Rob Painter: Well, I would -- the way I'd characterize it is go back that there's the element of the macro impact but let is at least half of where we see the delta. But let's talk a little bit about the nature of the market right now. And so the ELD mandate certainly attracted a lot of capital to the industry. And I would say not all of that capital was with smart capital, and we've seen some early shakeout in the market with some of the technology providers, whether they've exited the market or there's been reductions in force from some companies. So, now you apply that and you look at the customers themselves and if you got a pricing imbalance that's pinching carriers at the moment; that is going to increase some of the competitive pressure. And the nature of how we've seen some of the competition in the market shift is really -- I'll give you an example -- a product example is the bundling of the hardware with the software. And by and large, that is now how the market has moved because you have companies, like ourselves, but I'll say, other companies, younger companies, wanting to get the long tail subscription growth. And so that is certainly -- I've been talking about this for a few calls, that certainly negatively impacted the competitive environment, the hardware margins and it has that wrapping it now into the subscription. And so one of our announcements was that I had in the press release was moving hardware as a subscription offering. So, we do have that available to our customers. And in aggregate, that does have some net impact on the cash flow of the business because instead of taking that hardware revenue upfront, we'll wrap it into the subscription over time. Now, on a cumulative base, it'll also be fine over time to have a cumulative cash flow growth. That's ultimately even a better measure than ARR, cumulative cash flow.
Andrew DeGasperi: That's helpful. And just a follow-up on your -- on the Hardware-as-a-Service. Can you tell us what the duration is of that subscription on average?
Rob Painter: Typically three years. I mean, you can have one year or three years, but we typically are aiming for three years.
Andrew DeGasperi: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your last question comes from Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Richard Valera: Thank you. One more question on Transportation, if I could. So Rob, the quarter-over-quarter decline in Transportation was obviously pretty severe and abrupt, about $20 million down quarter-over-quarter. And from what I'm hearing, it sounds like you're expecting a gradual recovery, perhaps just a little bit in Q3. And I would assume that looking out over the next several quarters, that's the way to think about it, that we're not likely to get back any of that revenue in chunks to the upside and that we should think about this as more of a gradual recovery, perhaps from the what I would think is the trough in Q2. 
Rob Painter: That's a good way to think about it, yes.
Richard Valera: Great. And then just one more, if I could, on the OpEx, which you have talked about. So, that was -- so OpEx was down a very impressive almost $20 million, I guess, quarter-over-quarter, Q1 to Q2 and understand that's not sustainable. But any color at all on how much of that we kind of think we give back in Q2? I mean do we give back half that, a third of it, any color on that at all, it would be appreciated. Thank you.
David Barnes: Yes, this is David. That depends a little bit on how the market evolves and the virus and everything. I think it's safe to say, OpEx will be up, but nowhere near by the amount that it was down in the second quarter. Many of the factors that constrained OpEx on travel and a number of discretionary spending areas will continue to be meaningfully down. So, it will be up -- I'd say, up modestly from Q2 to Q3. 
Rob Painter: And in addition, we would also see some FX.
David Barnes: That's right. The U.S. dollar has weakened considerably. So, just the FX rates, a lot of our cost is outside the U.S. So that will put upward pressure on OpEx.
Richard Valera: Got it, okay. Thank you gentlemen. Appreciate it.
Operator: And we don't have any further questions at this time. I will now turn it over to Mr. Michael Leyba, Director of Investor Relations.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Trimble First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Rob Painter: Good afternoon. COVID-19 is on the forefront of everyone's mind. Our presentation format will be different this quarter and is structured to address topics that seem to be top of mind amongst our long-term shareholders. As always our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Before we start walking through the slides, we want to acknowledge that this is an extremely challenging and uncertain time for all of us and that everyone listening has their own unique set of circumstances they are dealing with. While these calls are designed for our investors our employees are also active listeners. In fact over 40% of our employees are shareholders. As such these updates speak to both audiences. In our current environment, we lead with a moral principle to support the health and safety of our community including employees, customers, and dealer partners. We also lead with a strategic principle to keep our business moving forward.  We have customers and partners who rely on Trimble to keep their businesses running to move the goods of commerce, to feed the global population, to build and maintain our infrastructure, and more. With heartfelt gratitude and by the level of dedication and resolve from our over 11,500 Trimble colleagues, a worldwide network of dealer partners and our customers. As a leadership team, we activated a comprehensive global business continuity plan in early March. The vast majority of Trimble is working remotely and we are in the process of defining when and how we gradually return to our office environments. The ongoing economic impact to Trimble will correlate to when and how we and our customers establish a set of new normal working conditions. While it feels like we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the fact remains that there is still a great deal of uncertainty. The essence of our planning has been to plan for the worst-case scenario and hope for the best. We took early and decisive action and I'm incredibly proud of how our team has rallied together as one Trimble. We will get through this crisis. We are well-positioned to endure the macroeconomic shock and we will emerge stronger on the other side of this. While we are managing the short-term realities, we are also equally focused on executing our long-term strategy. Let's shift to the presentation. Slide two has the seven key messages we want to address today. As I've just highlighted our team has risen to the challenge and this is point one. Point two, our first quarter results exceeded expectations demonstrating the quality of the Trimble strategy and the financial strength in the first 11 weeks of the quarter, A big thank you to the Trimble team. Point three our balance sheet and access to liquidity remain emphatically strong. Point four, as we look to the past to inform the actions of today, the multi-year execution of our strategy and the transformation of our business model has established more resiliency than at any point in our history. Point five; we took early and decisive management actions including increasing liquidity and implementing broad-based temporary pay reductions to fortify the business. My commitment to our Trimble team is to restore pay as soon as possible. Point six, we are suspending guidance and we will be as transparent as we can with the puts and takes we are seeing in the market and in our business. Point seven, the cumulative actions we have taken enable us to stay true to our long-term strategy Connect & Scale 2025. No changes. Moving to slide three, the message here is that our business is essential and our team is leading. My opening comments addressed much of what is on this slide. Before I turn it over to David, slide four offers a few examples of how Trimble is helping our customers and communities during this time. In our transportation business our team is offering a free service to display and collect current truck stop status and amenity information. We are also offering free driver trip planning to suggest open truck stops and rest areas. Our leasing team has put together programs that are enabling customers to extend payment terms. In our communities I'd like to highlight our Cityworks team which is offering a web-based GIS-centric platform for local governments to manage their emergency response efforts. David?
David Barnes: Thanks Rob. Turning to slide five, non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $794 million in the middle of our guidance range despite greater-than-anticipated weakness in demand late in the quarter as the pandemic impact widened. I'll note that Q1 revenue reflects outstanding management of the supply chain disruption coming out of China. We exceeded our initial expectations in fulfillment of customer demand despite the fact that the shutdowns in China were more severe and longer-lasting than we anticipated when we issued guidance in mid-February. Total revenue growth for the quarter was minus 1% which included minus 2% from organic growth and approximately minus 1% from changes in exchange rates as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter. Acquisitions added about 2% to revenue during the quarter. Our recurring revenue was strong with annualized recurring revenue or ARR up 7% year-on-year and up 6% on an organic basis. Note that this represents about a 1% acceleration from ARR performance in Q4 of 2019. Gross margins, operating margins, net income and EPS improved versus prior year and EPS came in well above our guidance range. Margins improved during the quarter for a number of reasons. Gross margins were higher year-on-year driven principally by an improvement in mix, as our higher margin software businesses performed relatively well during the quarter. Lower levels of discounting and the introduction of higher end new hardware products also improved margins. As the impending weakness in the economy became apparent, we pulled back on discretionary spending, including travel and outside services and we reduced our rate of hiring. In addition, our expense relating to incentive and commission plans was reduced meaningfully during the quarter. Note that the temporary pay reductions Rob mentioned in his remarks did not take effect until the last week of Q1, so we will see the vast majority of that cost benefit beginning in Q2. Turning to slide six. We are showing here revenue and profit trends by segment, and I'll touch on the factors, which are expected to drive the sector businesses going forward. The Resources and Utilities segment had a strong revenue and profit quarter driven by demand in the agricultural sector for aftermarket products and correction services. Late in the quarter our OEM business was impacted by factory shutdowns, but end customer demand proved to be solidly resilient through the quarter. Revenue trends were aided late in the quarter by customers buying product in anticipation of shutdowns in distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our Buildings and Infrastructure segment had organic growth in the quarter driven by our civil business and growth in our recurring revenue offerings. The organic growth occurred despite March weakness in project starts and bookings. With some notable exceptions most ongoing construction project activity continued despite COVID-19-related work restrictions. The Geospatial business got off to a strong start in the quarter driven by new products and by the timing of dealer orders. March results were much weaker both because dealers drew down inventories and because demand began to weaken with the decline in oil prices and the implementation of shelter-in-place rules. Transportation revenue was weak in the quarter, driven in part by the factors we discussed in our Q4 2019 release. As you will recall, we have experienced challenges related to the implementation of the ELD mandate in our telematics business. Revenue trends weakened further in March as the COVID-19 crisis took hold. During the quarter we made significant progress in addressing product functionality gaps and partly as a result, we are seeing lower churn coming out of the quarter. Going forward we plan to accelerate the transformation to higher-performing hardware across our customers' fleets. While these steps will put continued pressure on margins this year, we believe they will position the business for stability later this year in growth as the market returns to more normal conditions. The transportation market in Q1 was a meaningful turmoil relating to the pandemic. Providers to food retailers saw a significant spike in demand, while trucking companies supporting capital goods or energy markets experienced a significant reduction in freight demand. Overall, our business was impacted in March by a deterioration in market conditions and a decline in the number of trucks on the road. I'll note here that our maps business, which has a recurring revenue model saw strong demand through the quarter. One additional observation about the timing of revenue trends within Q1, revenue growth was strong through the first two months of the quarter and then weakened in March as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. Revenue growth was in the high single-digits through the first two months of the quarter and then was down in the mid-teens in March. I'd also like to comment briefly on the trends we have seen in our business after the full COVID-19 crisis hit in March. I'll start with our recurring revenue, which remains strong even in this period of facility shutdowns and economic weakness. Customer retention so far is in line with our pre-crisis experience. Our enterprise systems are critical for our clients' operations. Approximately 75% of our recurring revenue offerings represent field or enterprise software used day in and day out in the course of our customers' businesses. So as long as our customers remain in business and project activity continues then our products are essential. In fact usage of many of our systems has grown since the crisis intensified. We are however seeing a delay in bookings of recurring software as customers rethink their priorities and cope with facility shutdowns, but this will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2020 and we are holding our share of the new awards that are coming through. Our non-recurring revenue businesses are unsurprisingly experiencing more adverse trends since the COVID-19 crisis expanded in March. Our OEM hardware business, which collectively makes up less than 15% of revenue have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of many of our customers' production facilities. Hardware sales have been adversely hampered by work restrictions at our dealers and at their customers, while much of our professional service business has been impacted by the lack of access to our clients' people and facilities. Encouragingly, we entered Q2 with over $1.2 billion of backlog. Of this amount roughly $250 million is from our non-recurring revenue businesses up versus the same period last year. We expect the majority of that backlog to convert to revenue this year. Turning now to slide seven. Our cash flow balance sheet and access to liquidity remains strong. During Q1, we generated $156 million of cash flow from operations, up 5% from the prior year. We ended the quarter with $217 million of cash. We have renegotiated terms of an outstanding term loan to extend the maturity from July of 2021 to July of 2022. As you can see from the table, we anticipate no principal due on any of our outstanding debt for the next two years. We also have over $1 billion of untapped borrowing capacity on our credit facility. Our outstanding debt is rated investment-grade by both Moody's and S&P with stable outlooks from both agencies. Moody's just reaffirmed their rating and stable outlook in a report issued last week. We finished Q1 with financial ratios comfortably in compliance with our credit line covenants. We have a strong primary focus on ensuring credit facility compliance and access to liquidity as we model potential scenarios for our business in the coming quarters. Our business generates significant cash flow, consistently in excess of earnings even in times of economic downturn. Our financial modeling shows that the business would continue to generate significant free cash flow even in environment of revenue reduction significantly worse than what we saw in the global financial crisis. In summary, our balance sheet is strong and we have taken action to further strengthen our capital structure as the COVID-19 crisis has unfolded. The current capital structure and the demonstrated ability of our business model to generate cash even under adverse scenarios gives us the platform to weather the crisis and to continue to execute our strategy. Turning now to slide eight. I'd like to point your attention to several ways in which our business model has evolved since the beginning of the last two phases of real weaknesses in our end markets, the global financial crisis at the end of 2008 and the commodity price declines of several years ago. Note that in 2008, hardware represented nearly 90% of Trimble revenues, and that the Geospatial segment made up just under half of our business. This revenue mix left us highly vulnerable to reductions in capital spend in a number of markets, especially oil and gas. With this business mix Trimble revenue declined 15% in 2009. In the last 12 years, our model has evolved significantly with hardware now making up less than half of our revenue and our sector and geographic diversification leaves us better able to withstand any focused reduction in capital spending activity. As I noted earlier, the one-third of our business with the recurring revenue model is holding up well through the first months of the COVID-19 crisis. The point here is that our business model is more resilient than ever with a more diversified and stable revenue mix. Turning now to slide nine. I'll talk about efforts we have undertaken across a number of areas to fortify our business for the recession we now see coming. From a capital allocation perspective, we've taken a number of steps to ensure that our balance sheet remains strong. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program and put a hold on significant new acquisitions until we can see clear signs of recovery in our business and end markets. As I noted earlier, we have negotiated an extension on the scheduled maturity of an existing term loan. From a cost perspective, we have taken action on a number of fronts. These actions include an immediate reduction in discretionary spend like travel, lower forecasted payouts on our incentive plans, the elimination of our planned annual salary increase, and a broad-based temporary salary reduction program. The salary reduction program, which took effect just as Q1 ended reduces our payroll base of $200 million per quarter by approximately 10%. Note that, the reductions were implemented in a progressive approach. Many of our frontline workers receive no reduction at all while our CEO, Board of Directors and senior leadership team have accepted temporary reductions of 50%. Of the $20 million per quarter salary savings approximately 75% or $15 million per quarter will show up in operating expense with the remainder in cost of goods sold. The salary savings when combined with our other cost reduction initiatives have reduced our quarterly run rate of operating expenses by roughly $30 million per quarter lower than the first quarter 2020 run rate and $50 million per quarter when compared with our pre-COVID 2020 plan. From a supply chain perspective, we plan to keep doing what worked well for us in Q1 as we managed the disruptions in China. Our team has shown an ability to be creative and flexible in responding to whatever disruptions we see in the market and we will constantly readjust our plans to ensure that we meet evolving customer demand. Now, I will turn it back over to Rob to talk about our views looking forward.
Rob Painter: Let's move to slide 10. While we are suspending our second quarter and total year guidance, we also want to be transparent and talk about the areas where we have more and less visibility. David described a number of ways in which our business was impacted in March as the economic slowdown took hold. I'll expand on those comments and give you some thoughts on how we see our business trending in the second quarter. The overall performance of the quarter will correlate to the opening up of global economies and the return of more normalized demand patterns. The areas of the business model where we have the most visibility and confidence includes ARR, gross margins, and operating expenses. ARR represents approximately one-third of our total revenue. In the second quarter, we expect this to be up in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. We'd also expect to see modest gross margin expansion as our revenue is increasingly weighted towards software-centric revenue. Relative to operating expenses, David covered the cost containment actions we took. In our non-recurring revenue businesses, new hardware demand and new logo software bookings growth has been depressed during the shelter-in-place time. We are digitally engaging with prospective customers and building our pipeline, but the fact remains that the rate of deal closure levels are below what we experienced at the beginning of the year. Looking at our reporting segments and taking a view of the puts and takes in the end markets, we have a point of view on the relative performance we expect across the segments. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue in all reporting segments to be down in the second quarter. We expect resources and utilities to outperform amongst the segments driven by our correction services and utilities businesses. On the other side, we expect Geospatial to underperform amongst the segments given the hardware centricity of the reporting segment. Turning to our last slide. I want to step back for a moment and revisit two of the three first principles we established upfront during the crisis. We said, we would protect and strengthen the core of Trimble and position ourselves to exit the crisis in a stronger competitive position. The underlying investment thesis of Trimble is stronger than ever. That is the digitization of end markets that are historically underserved and underpenetrated with technology that delivers productivity, quality, safety, visibility and environmental sustainability to our customers. With that backdrop, our long-term shareholders expect us to deliver long-term sustainable value. We believe we have taken the responsible short-term actions to confidently weather the crisis, which allows us to stay focused on our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which we believe is more relevant than ever. The takeaway here is that we will play offense on core elements of our strategy, in particular the transition to subscription revenue models across our business. We will also continue to invest in business processes and systems to accelerate the strategic transformation. As evidenced, we are pulling forward some of our transitions into 2020 and 2021. For example, we launched our transportation management system as a subscription offering and we now see more than half of our new bookings being subscriptions instead of perpetual license offerings. As another important example at CONEXPO in February, we announced what we are calling Trimble Platform as a Service that bundles our machine control and guidance kit along with Trimble productivity software into a subscription offering. Customers will benefit from technology assurance and a platform that can be feature upgraded. They also benefit by converting to an OpEx model and being able to more easily charge machine time to specific projects. We further connect this job cost information with our viewpoint construction ERP system and our works OS platform that bring together data elements from other Trimble and non-Trimble technology into a single tool to remotely manage productivity and uptime of the site. In our agriculture business, we are now offering bundles of our guidance hardware along with our software and correction services. The aim is to make ourselves easier to do business with and to reduce friction in the buying process. Next our strategy guides us to further connect our industry life cycles. As evidence of our progress in the construction market, we expect Trimble Connect to reach 10 million users in the second quarter and we currently have over 80,000 active multiuser projects being managed in Connect. This user base provides us a platform to deepen our customer engagement over time and more importantly than ever provides an environment for them to continue to collaborate on projects from anywhere. Finally, we have not pulled back our R&D efforts and we will continue our 40-plus year history of innovation. Two examples I want to share here. First at CONEXPO, we announced our Earthworks 2.0 system that enables extensibility of the base platform. For example, we launched automated horizontal steering capabilities, which advances our progress on the path to autonomy. Using this platform, we demonstrated remote control capabilities and operated a set of equipment in Dayton, Ohio from the show floor in Las Vegas. Second, in our correction services business, the team achieved a great milestone in the quarter, completing a multiyear effort, deploying our RTX Fast technology across the contiguous U.S. parts of Southern Canada and much of Western Europe. We now cover nearly five million square miles with RTX Fast capability, which allows users to realize one centimeter accuracy in less than one minute via Internet or satellite broadcast. RTX Fast is ideally suited for autonomous on-road and off-road applications. To conclude, I would like to thank everyone for your time and your support and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let's please go to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ann Duignan: Hi, good afternoon, I guess. It’s afternoon your time as well as ours. So good to hear all of you. My first question is around the resource business and it really performed significantly better than we had anticipated or forecasted. Can you just talk a little bit about what actually happened there? And how sustainable the margins are there? Or whether it was a one-off rollout of some new product? Thank you.
Rob Painter: So yes, there was a few factors that contributed to the outperform in the quarter, which includes some of the following. So it wasn't early planting season overall, which we think helped the business to some degree. To the credit of the team the new product introductions that have come out in the last month seem to be doing well in the market and we think that that contributed. The other part that's in Resources and Utilities as a reporting segment is our correction services business, as well as a set of utility and local government businesses we have. Our correction services business had a very strong first quarter which we believe also correlated not only to the health of the business but the early planting season. And then our utilities business has been coming along nicely and the Cityworks acquisition that we completed a few months ago is off to a nice start. So a number of factors came together in the reporting segment to set up a next quarter.
Ann Duignan: And if Q1 was supported by the early planting, does that mean that the margins have peaked for the year despite everything else that's going on but seasonally we would expect Q1 margins to be the strongest?
Rob Painter: Yes that's a good point, Ann and that would be correct.
Ann Duignan: Okay. And then on Buildings and Infrastructure, how lack -- how little visibility do you really have on the hardware side in that business just given what's going on with construction, equipment, production and then sales? I know you listed it as a risk in one of the further out slides. But if you could just address where do you see the greatest risk to your business in Buildings and Infrastructure? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Well, there's certainly less visibility into the hardware business than the recurring revenue, software we have in the reporting segment. If I take it from an angle of sentiment from customers, I would say we're hearing mixed reports from customers so far. On the positive side, we came in -- as we came into the first quarter, our customers had backlog and the sentiment was strong. And then as the virus took hold, projects clearly slowed down or halted and that was a negative at the end of the quarter. So here in the next few, I'll say weeks or months, as our customers get back to work, we expect, I'd say the hardware side of the business to proverbially come back to work as well. And now what I would say is we also hear some concern about work coming into looking forward into 2021. And then we also hear shift in sentiment as you would expect around some of the end market work. So something like commercial work or energy-related work will be difficult work such as hospitals or data centers would be good. So the mix of work is we expect to change as well.
Ann Duignan: So if I have to rank order your customers in B&I, the construction equipment probably the weakest sentiment maybe your contractors next given the projects just stopped. And then maybe the later cycle the architects, et cetera may be a little bit less impacted at this point is that a fair characterization? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Rob Painter: That's pretty close. I'd say, I mean in the software businesses, overall the work we do is of essential nature. It's an ERP system you're either in business or you're not in -- the technology continues to be fundamental to the business and used. The -- then there is the next category I would take the construction equipment, let's say the contractors and then the third would be the OEM. So OEM-related revenue that we have I would put at the bottom of the list in the rank order.
Ann Duignan: Okay. Appreciate the color. I’ll get back in line. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes. Hi, and thank you for the question. It's interesting you're offering some new utilities to some of your customers to help deal with coronavirus in various ways, whether it'd be on the trucking side or just on the safety side. I'm a little bit curious, I mean, it's a tough saying that it's obviously an opportunity to potentially reach new customers. So is that expanding your reach? Is it mostly to existing folks that you have? Is it offering new features that they wouldn't have otherwise seen to them? And can you just give a little bit of a sense of how much that helps you expand?
Rob Painter: Well, the apps themselves are available to any company. So we didn't make a distinction of a customer not a customer. Now you'll probably get more value out of it if you are an existing customer and you're integrating into the bigger workflow. So I suspect there is a degree of let's say visibility or reach to potentially new customers but I should say it wasn't initiated as a marketing effort...
Rob Wertheimer: Yes. I didn't mean to imply I'm sorry. And then the second question I guess is just on defensiveness. Again, this is a little bit of a real-time test and how bad things can get. And I'm curious if it gives you a sense of how much trucking activity is down you probably do? And just whether you lose firms or customers or individual licenses? So, just a sense of the defensiveness as to how far the market to fall in trucking might be interesting. Thanks. I'll stop there.
Rob Painter: That's a good question, Rob. Certainly, the trucking market and well I say North America is certainly challenged at the moment and we see that the same data that you do whether it's the new Class eight units or now inventory levels or spot market rates. So it is a tough macro setup here in the near -- I'll say near to midterm for trucking companies. And David covered looking back at Q1, there were actually also some quite bright spots. And -- but looking forward, yes, I would say the macro is more negative at this point. Now when we think about the defensibility of the business, we actually also think this becomes a strength for Trimble. And so far, as we've got the value proposition and we've got the balance sheet to continue to be able to invest in this business, we've seen a couple of competitive companies either go out of the market or significantly cut back in the last couple of weeks. So from a competitive position, we'll continue to play offense in this business. We think we've got a winning strategy and we believe in the team that we have that's pursuing the strategy. So, we won't back off of let's say the pursuit of the business strategy. And we're confident that as we come out of this that we'll come out of it stronger. And that's really a major part of the orientation, we have as we really came into this is make sure that we position ourselves to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing than how we entered it.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Rob, could you -- I think in the guide you spoke to just some thoughts around the second quarter suggesting that really all four business groups would be down year-over-year in revenue. And just trying to sift through your commentary about weakening in March, are there any of the four business groups that might be expected to see revenue growth sequentially in the second quarter?
Rob Painter: Okay. So, if we think about the businesses sequentially in the second quarter, the short answer is, it wouldn't change my answer. I mean historically, you would expect to see construction especially civil construction coming on stronger in the second quarter given the summer season for construction. But we don't see that happening this in the second quarter. Otherwise, if you took a market let's say Resources and Utilities which is ag-centric, you would expect to see that seasonally decline in the second quarter if I use that as a sort of a contra example.
Richard Eastman: Yes. And then Geospatial given the oil and gas exposure that's down sequentially and then transportation I guess you addressed. So -- okay. In your remarks Rob, you had mentioned that you can -- it feels like you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I'm just kind of curious, is that kind of a suggestion that you can maybe said differently you can see the bottom? Or what green shoots did you -- were you kind of looking at to suggest that?
Rob Painter: Well we stay in close contact not only with our dealer partners around the world, but our end customers and prospects and the pipeline that we have in the various businesses. If we look at a market let's say, if we take Asia, we can start to see business coming back in parts of Asia. So, if we take a market like China, now China is a small portion of Trimble these days less than 2% of revenue. But we have started to see business come back. If we look in the Nordics, we can start to see some of the business coming back as well. And so there's a bit of a geographic overlay to that Rick that informs the point of view that we feel like we're seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. As we look in North America and the governments are local -- and I'll say local governments are starting to talk about return to work or lifting some of the restrictions that it certainly plays into some of our psychology of seeing people getting back to work. They can be on the other end of that phone call for the demand side of this equation.
Richard Eastman: I got you. Okay. And can I just ask one more question. I think, I just wanted to go back to the -- you had mentioned you're entering the second quarter with -- I think it was $1.2 billion -- $1.2 billion of backlog. And I didn't catch the rest of the comment. There was a reference to $250 million, but the strong backlog again defers no cancellations. I mean you're basically just seeing project pushouts. Is that...
David Barnes: Hi Rick, it's David Barnes. Yes the $250 million is the backlog of our leading up the recurring business. And the point I made is that amount is higher than it was a year ago. And now we haven't seen any meaningful cancellations yet. There are as you inferred some delays but nothing in our backlog is being canceled of any consequence.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Devin Au from Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Devin Au: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. Just one for me. So I know you mentioned utility and construction are still performing. Just wondering if you could provide any color on other industries and geographies that you are seeing that are kind of underway back to normal level towards the end of I guess, April and thus far in May that you're seeing?
Rob Painter: Well the markets that we see coming back to some degree are in some of the Asian markets I'll use China as an example and in the Nordics in Europe where the couple of examples I pointed out that would be current time. If I look at Q1 itself, I can use Brazil as an example, where we had a strong quarter in Brazil both in the agriculture business but even more so in our transportation business in Brazil. And so there's pockets of performance around I'd say around the globe. I think you asked something -- I did miss the first part of the question around utilities can you repeat that?
Devin Au: Yes. That was just kind of looking an example that are kind of performing pretty well in first quarter but I guess are you seeing other industries that are I guess on their way back to normal level thus far in the second quarter?
Rob Painter: The way I'd approach that is from a business model perspective the ARR was up 7% in the first quarter and certainly outperforming -- differentially performing against the rest of the portfolio. And so the businesses associated with that I think are the ones to highlight. So the construction related ARR that we have. The correction services business has performed a really outstanding performance in the quarter and where we see that business now as well. So those would be a couple of the spots I would point out in particular.
Devin Au: Great. Thank you very much.
Rob Painter: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon and good evening everyone. I'm glad you're all doing well.
Rob Painter: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Rob your comments about gross margin expansion really stood out to be considering what I would imagine would be pretty significant declines in perpetual license sales. Can you just expand what level of perpetual license sales declines you're seeing in April? And how you folks are able to essentially guide to improving gross margin in this environment that really stood out to me? Thanks.
Rob Painter: Well, if I took three revenue streams when we took the recurring revenue stream, we took the aggregate of software and perpetual software term software and professional services is the second category and then the third one being hardware. ARR is certainly the highest performer. And then in the -- I could reference you to the web tables that also break out the gross margin by these revenue types. And of course ARR is going to have the highest -- amongst the highest gross margins. And then if we look at -- and of course that grew in the quarter the ARR that was plus 7%. And on the other let's say book end would be the hardware businesses were at minus 8% year-over-year in the first quarter and are the lowest gross margin it's a category of revenue that we have. And then if we look at the perpetual software and the pro services that was down in the quarter and it'd be down, as well and therefore, extrapolate down in March, down in April as well. It's just not down as much as the hardware. So it's a kind of low single-digit range. And I'll just give you one more I guess nugget. Within that software category, we have about $80 million on a trailing 12-month basis of term license revenue that shows up as software not as a recurring revenue and that tranche within the software is growing nicely and is a profitable stream. So yes, you take the mix of that and you get the gross margin expansion which was clearly a major driver of the beat in the quarter on the EPS side.
Jerry Revich: And that's pretty resilient performance for the perpetual license business as well. Okay. And then in terms of the subscription offering so you spoke about accelerating the shift, can you just update us on the performance in terms of bookings growth in the transportation management system so far this year? And can you talk about relative to I think the $500 million target of subscription opportunity you have within the existing portfolio with integrator approach here? What's the cadence on translating that from perpetual license to recurring? Thanks.
Rob Painter: So if we look at the transportation management system, business or product line that we have, more than half bookings in the first quarter came as a subscription bookings. So really actually outperformed our own expectations we have as we do offer both subscription and perpetual offering. And of course, probably goes without saying that having that subscription offering becomes differentiably a good thing for customers in a tighter cash environment to move to an OpEx model. It also expands -- we believe expands an addressable market into the mid-size carriers through the conversion. If I look at the other businesses, I'll give you a couple of examples within -- actually within Buildings and Infrastructure. So we have a mechanical electrical plumbing business that's well over $100 million in revenue same thing with the steel and concrete structure business. Both of which we think we have significant opportunity to convert to subscription. And so in fact in our MEP business, we launched what's called Accubid Anywhere. That is a subscription offering and it's off to a decent start. Our structures business -- and I'd say a number of other businesses in Trimble that we have put in the category of -- we have some subscription elements of those businesses, but they are small elements of the business and we're really looking to accelerate and do the work I'd say the groundwork in 2020 to be able to really move quickly as we come in to next year. So not all of these actions I'm talking about will turn into increased ARR this year. But what I would want you to hear is that we think this is the time -- in this moment of crisis, this is the time to move faster on these conversions. And so we're shifting resources around shifting priorities around so that we can come to market faster with these offerings. We think it's the right thing to do for the long-term health of the business. And at a time of uncertainty like we have right now I think that cause for us to be decisive and this is one of those areas where we really are I think taking decisive action to move faster.
Jerry Revich: And Rob, sorry, just a clarification. So transportation management you had mentioned that half of new bookings are subscription, but when you combine them subscription and perpetual what was the year-over-year growth that you achieved as a result?
Rob Painter: No. So what I would say from an overall bookings perspective, if we just kind of step back and talk about software bookings or perpetual software bookings and let's separate January, February from kind of late March until now, the new bookings are off significantly at an aggregate level. And I would say, in fact, more than 50% down in these last few weeks. And that's quite consistent from what we hear in the market. So in the short-term the new bookings are really -- they really are taking a hit. Now you won't see that so much in the revenue today or in a Q2, Q3. It becomes -- this really becomes a factor of how long does this last? When we hit bottom, how long does that -- what's the nature of the slope out of it will determine how much of that plays into 2021. And so I do -- I should just note that that's what we see on the overall bookings level. And then if I was to get really specific about the transportation management system in the booking, we'll look at -- when we take a booking you want to make it equivalent to what a perpetual booking would be so that you understand the real underlying driver. So look at it on a multiyear basis so that you can equate it to the nature of what would have been a perpetual booking as you plan the business around that.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is Kristen [ph] on for Colin. Thank you for taking our question. Just a few operational questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your supply chain in Mexico on the hardware side just remind us how much third-party manufacturing exposure you have in that region? And what you're hearing from your suppliers as they remain under those stay-at-home orders?
Rob Painter: Yes. So I would say Kristen, we have -- I'd say a meaningful part of our contract manufacturing comes out of Mexico in fact much more so than China. Of course, components come from China, but the manufacturing has a substantial elements in Mexico. And the short answer is -- is that we've been up and running. In fact in some cases, we've gotten more capacity from the contract manufacturers as other companies have either shut down temporarily or they weren't essential businesses whatever factor it may be that in some cases actually enabled resources, I'd say labor resources to move to Trimble product which helped in businesses like agriculture, for example in the first quarter that exceeded the expectations. We have one operation in Guadalajara that's under a state-at-home order that really isn't running at this point, but we had enough I'd say heads up on that to build a little bit of inventory and it happens to be a business where the demand is also quite down. So it hasn't been an impact. But where it really matters we've been up and running.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And sort of speaking to the inventory point, I wanted to ask about your dealer channel and how much of that was under essential services? I think you mentioned some pre-buy activity ahead of those stay-at-home orders. So any commentary that you can provide on inventory build? Or what you're seeing in the dealer channel right now?
Robert Painter: If anything, at this point in the quarter today, we would see really more of an inventory reduction or drawdown. I would say, there were certain parts of the channel in Q1 probably around the February time frame that were I think doing a little bit of buying ahead of the impending shutdowns. It's hard to discern exactly what the nature of the buy is. But we look at the levels of inventory right now, and we think that actually the dealers are being quite responsible overall. So it's really something we want to pay attention to, because it's in our interest that our dealers remain healthy and have liquidity. So we feel good about on an aggregate basis in all the businesses at the level of inventory that our dealers have. In terms of the essential nature of the businesses and how that impacts dealers, really for the most part on a global basis, our dealers have been up and running. I could go back to what Trimble does, feeding a growing population. It was planting season or it was and is planting season. In construction, we knew many of the projects were continuing to be at work and our customers were counting on us to be there as Trimble and also as our dealer partners. And same thing in transportation, you can imagine, the stress on transportation companies as they were moving essential goods and we needed to be there running for them. So, they've maintained being open for the most part. Of course, with the government had a complete shutdown with Italy as an example, we were also down during that time. And then -- but even on an interesting note in Italy, we were actually up on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter based on the strength of what that team brought into the beginning of the quarter and as well in the Geospatial business as well as the ongoing agriculture business.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now open.
John Weidemoyer: Hi. This is John Weidemoyer for Jonathan. Thanks for taking the question. I just have one. Can you talk about your level of optimism regarding the potential for infrastructure stimulus spend?
Rob Painter: Sure. So on infrastructure, I would say, we've got a mixed view. So let me take a global view first. If you look at the U.K., HS2 project got a notice to proceed. If you look at China, they've made some big infrastructure announcements. If we talk about the U.S., which I think is really what you're asking about. Well, what we know is our infrastructure is aging and that suggests that we're talking about when and not if something happens in infrastructure. So we are net optimistic that something will be happening on the funding side in the U.S. hopefully in the next package in the next relief package. But let's be clear that has not happened yet. I would note that many states in the last months or a couple of years have increased their own gas taxes. That enables them to take more control of their own destiny. But if we look at the flip side to be complete with the analysis, the FAST Act expires on September 30 and that needs to be either renewed or extended. If we look at state tax revenue that is greatly suffering and that would obviously benefit from some form of a federal backstop. And then we have the American Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019. And there we still have bipartisan disagreement on how to pay for it. So there are a set of, I would say, what I would call negative or cautious factors, the flip side being that infrastructure is such an obvious and important place for us to make investments here in the U.S. and a logical -- would be a logical part of a relief package. But of course, we haven't seen it yet.
John Weidemoyer: Thank you. That’s all. Appreciate it. That’s it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is Eric [ph] on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just touching on a piece that may not be as topical, but understanding you're taking maybe a slower approach to acquisitions for now. But I'm wondering has the current environment sparked your interest in any new potential growth areas or opportunities you could look to be more active in the future?
Rob Painter: Well, the first place we've looked in the current environment is internally. And in that respect, really pivoting we want to pivot faster -- I'll say, faster harder to the subscription model. We've referenced a couple of the software businesses. But I neglected to mention the announcement we made at CONEXPO that launch what we call Trimble Platform as a Service to essentially to bundle. Our machine controlling guidance with our construction productivity software to connect the office and the field together and which we think is a unique offering. And that to us is really the first place we want to think about and look. And so the extent at which we're leveraging balance sheet or P&L, because let's do the math, the movement from perpetual to a subscription offering does have a short-term drag to a P&L into cash. That's the first place that we want to look to that. Secondarily, as the market moves, whether that's geographies or end-markets, we will pivot fast to what the market makes available or what it has available. And just maybe as a small example. But I think meaningful is I take an example like a trade show. Well in our agriculture business in Brazil, the team in the first quarter did a virtual trade show in Brazil that had over 3,000 people attended. Extraordinary ingenuity and creativity from the team and I would call that taking advantage of what's available and taking action around what's available to us in an environment. Now you asked then about externally in acquisitions. And with that pivot how we think. I would say there wouldn't be a fundamental pivot is the short answer.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it that’s helpful. And then maybe just kind of sticking on some of the bundled subscriptions offerings, how are those being structured where there's kind of hardware and from like thinking through a replacement cycle side? Is there a cadence built into those offerings? And maybe like just how we should think about that?
Rob Painter: That's a good question. So if we took an example -- I'll give you an example on agriculture and an example on civil construction. And an agriculture example, that looks like bundling our guidance hardware with our office software or office and field software with our correction services. So you can get that centimetre level accuracy on the farm that a farmer needs. That to me is, less about accounting and technology replacement. That's really about reducing friction in the buying process. Instead of three separate transactions, it can happen as one transaction at the proverbial point of sale. If we take the civil construction example and the technology, our Trimble Platform as a Service offering, we announced at ConExpo, that does have a technology assurance aspect to it. And so there we could see a cadence. Let's take an example of a GPS receiver. If we have a new GPS or really GNSS receiver available, we can use that to upgrade the kit that the customer has on-site to provide them the latest functionality. So technology assurance is a really meaningful part of the strategy. The technology continues to get better every year, not only the sensors or the hardware but really the firmware and the software. And so for us it's important to be able to have a continued touch point to be able to update that. To be able to update firmware and display software you have to have connectivity to the machine. And we have that through the telematics product lines. We have that will also integrate into this offering. Now if we get forensically -- forensic on the accounting of it, the accounting has what's called an SSP, which really breaks out the value into its parts. And so the accounting will dictate what will show up, on the P&L.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to, Michael Leyba for closing remarks.
Michael Leyba: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-12 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Michael Leyba, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Leyba: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. I’m here today with Rob Painter, our CEO and David Barnes, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today’s call are available on our website at www.trimble.com as well as within the webcast, and we will be referring to the presentation today. In addition, we will also be posting our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website at investor.trimble.com shortly after the completion of this call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company’s Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today’s call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. First, Rob will start with an overview of the quarter and the year. After that, David will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter and the year, our guidance and then we will go to Q&A. I would also like to briefly mention that, we will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference on March 2nd in San Francisco. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and will I will turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Painter: Good afternoon, everyone. The focus of my comments today will be on Trimble’s direction going forward. For baseline context, our fourth quarter revenue came in well ahead of expectations as that EPS. More importantly, ARR was $1.13 billion, up 6% and free cash flow was $516 million on a trailing 12-month basis, up 23%. Revenue and EPS were record levels for 2019. This represents my first call as CEO. Steve Berglund is now our Executive Chairman and Borje Ekholm, CEO of Ericsson has joined our Board of Directors. In addition, David Barnes is in place as our new CFO. David is off to a strong start and is focused on helping us both transformer business models and put in place the enabling mechanisms to efficiently and effectively scale on a global basis. As I take over as CEO, I have the benefit of having been with the company for 14 years, in both operating and executive leadership roles. I continue to believe with great conviction and the strength of the Trimble business model. I’m also mindful that as an important to refine strategy when macro or competitive dynamic shift in meaningful ways. From an investor lens, our objective is to allocate capital and resources with an owner/operator mindset. That looks like one, executing a compelling strategy that drives unique customer value, thereby creating and sustaining competitive advantage. Two, pursuing business models that create lifetime customer value, and three, putting shareholder capital and management bandwidth to work in the highest return areas that is ultimately measured by free cash flow. Would have stayed the same since we put our business model for the Investor Day in May of 2018 is threefold. One, our end markets are fundamentally attractive at a secular level. They’re large global markets that are undergoing digital transformation. Two, our solutions deliver substantial return on investment as measured by productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. Three, our differentiation, which happens at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds, that is, the technology stack enables hardware, software and services that allow us to connect work from the office, to the field and back. Overall, we believe strongly that our business will create compelling returns over a cycle. We played out different than we anticipated a couple of years ago, with the emergence of trade disputes as well as the influx of private capital on December of our end markets. On the positive side, we played out better has been the acceleration of software and ARR as a percentage of our overall revenue mix, as well as our product innovation achievements. As I come into the CEO role, my aim is to make the right long-term decisions that unlock sustainable shareholder value. In our last call, we said we would take a fresh look at the portfolio, strategy, structure and systems while respecting 41 years of what got us here. On that note, I think we are off to a strong incredible start. We have launched the new strategy that we refer to as connect and scale 2025. We will connect the industry lifecycle as we serve, we will accelerate our move towards subscription business models, both in software and hardware. We will connect our solutions in the bundled offerings, and we will begin to enable our data strategy that we believe we are uniquely positioned to fulfill. Our strategy challenges us to reinvent ourselves, whether that’d be through business model transitions or making disciplined and strategic bets on further shaping industry transformation. Our markets are dynamic and changing fast and we will lead. We will also allocate capital in our underlying systems to help us efficiently and effectively scale. As proof points that we are in motion on the strategy, four examples. First, we said we would take a fresh look at the portfolio. In the last four months, we exited three businesses, while financially immaterial to Trimble, they do increase our focus. Second, we said we would take a fresh look at the organizational structure. I moved from having 10 businesses operational, direct reports to five, we did this by bringing together the assets within our construction, geospatial, resources and transportation franchises. The structure enables our industry lifecycle strategy, breaks down organizational silos and helps us approach our markets more holistically. One leader; one unified direction. We also stood up a fifth franchise business for autonomy, where we brought together a number of efforts across Trimble under one umbrella. Third, innovation. In the fourth quarter we launched a number of notable solutions, including some of the following that are also shown on Slide 7. We started shipping the XR10, which is mixed reality device, purpose built for integration into an industry standard Hardhat for using construction environments. The XR10 enables users to overlay a constructible building information models and other digital project data on to the physical context for the job site, truly connecting the physical and digital worlds. In Geospatial, we began shipping our X7 3D laser scanner, which opens up a category and serving in construction that was previously missing. We also launched our new R12 GNSS receiver, which allows surveyors working in challenging GNSS environments to reduce both the time in the field and increase accuracy up to 30%. Weedseeker 2 in agriculture launched and it spot sprays weeds and provides growers up to 90% savings in input costs when targeting and treating herbicide resistant weeds. In our construction software business, we own a number of new logos that included a solutions bundle with Viewpoint 1 and Tekla structures. In this case, we are integrating pre-fabrication and shop planning through Tekla with purchasing and project costing through Viewpoint. As a fourth example, to highlight our willingness to reinvent ourselves, by putting the spotlight on our recent acquisitions on Slides 5 and 6. Starting with Kuebix, which we closed on January 14th. Kuebix provides a platform that we believe accelerates the reinvention of our transportation strategy and business model. The fundamental problems underlying the transportation industry include; tight operating ratios, driver turnover and poorer resource utilization. The Kuebix investment thesis is threefold. One, to extend the Kuebix cloud-based community of shippers, carriers and intermediaries to include Trimble’s carrier customers, representing approximately 1.3 million assets, enabling dynamic and optimal planning, execution and freight matching. Two, to expand the addressable market by more than $2.5 billion. And three, significantly accelerate our delivery of a multi-tenant carrier transportation management system in the cloud. Overall, the strategic thesis is compelling. In the short term, the acquisition will be dilutive to transportation reporting segment margins and company earnings per share. The proof points in 2020 of our execution will be; increasing the size of the shipper community, connecting carrier capacity, accelerating transaction volume through the platform and accelerating our next-gen carrier SaaS platform. We also announced three acquisitions in the fourth quarter. In our utilities business, we acquired Cityworks, whose core strength is an enterprise asset management software platform for utilities and local governments, which include mobile, IoT and infrastructure lifecycle solutions. The combination will provide a comprehensive digital platform with real-time asset intelligence, workflows and analytics for transforming the way governments and utilities prioritize infrastructure maintenance and construction investments. In addition, we announced the acquisition of two virtual reference station networks that add over 1.1 million square kilometers to Trimble’s correction services coverage in Canada and New Zealand. Our subscription based DRS correction services are accessible to customers around the world who rely on high accuracy corrections to increase productivity and reduce operational costs. The correction services are ideal for professionals in agriculture, Geospatial and construction as well as emerging high accuracy applications, such as on-road positioning for passenger vehicles. The common thread of these acquisitions is that they are all software businesses that connect industry lifecycles. Our leadership team is committed to the new direction of our connect and scale 2025 strategy. Over the next couple of quarters, our team will cascade the strategy deeply into the businesses by applying the Trimble operating system framework, which calls on us to continually focus in all three dimensions of strategy, people and execution. These build on each other to create a high performing organization. The natural question that emerges is, what is this implies for a long-term financial model. Our aim is to hold an Analysts Day to update the view on the long-term model in the second half of the year, and then in the fourth quarter user dimensions user conferences is a solutions demonstration and education venue. What we can share now is that we will look towards the metrics that reflect the transition of our business to an increasingly subscription-based digital model. You will see some of these metrics on Slide 4, such as ARR and cash flow. Our recognized revenue and EPS remain important, yet increasingly incomplete measures of progression. Last, a couple of comments on company performance. In the transportation reporting segment, the results are not to our standard. We have work to do and we have a plan. In our mobility business, meeting the demands of the ELD mandate proved harder than originally expected. We elected the right software for both our older hardware technology as well as our newer hardware platforms. Supporting multiple platforms has proven to be a larger than anticipated R&D and customer migration support effort. This resulted in higher expenses and customer churn, which is negatively impacting margins and ARR. We’ve got a plan to get the performance back on track, and it begins with delivering upon our customer commitments. We brought in a number of new leaders into the business and we are more proactively migrating customers from old technology platforms to new technology platforms. The nature of the business is that, we have long subscriber lifetimes. It is therefore in our interest to take short-term financial pain to upgrade customers to newer technology platforms in order to preserve the lifetime value of our customer relationships. Between the acquisition of Kuebix and working on the mobility business, we anticipate 2020 profitability roughly in line with 2019 profitability. Our commitment is to make progress in 2020 that puts us on a course to deliver 2021 profitability closer in line to the Trimble model. In the other reporting segments, revenue exceeded expectations led by solid performance in all of Buildings & Infrastructure as well as Geospatial. On earnings per share, performance exceeded expectations with robust performance in Buildings & Infrastructure, Resources & Utilities and Geospatial. Let me now turn the call over to David.
David Barnes: Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon. In my commentary, I will review the results for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2019, before closing with guidance. Starting on Slide 8, fourth quarter total revenue was $827 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 4.3% year-over-year and above our guidance range. To break that down, currency translation subtracted 1% and acquisitions net of divestitures added 1%. Organic growth was 4% with approximately 3% growth from the impact of the 14th week. ARR or annualized recurring revenue grew to $1.13 billion in the quarter up 6% year-over-year and was up 5% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was $193 million, with a margin of 23.4%. Operating income dollars increased 4% to $178 million with operating margins of 21.6% essentially flat versus prior year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% also flat on a year-over-year basis. Net income was up close to 10% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.53, up 5% or over 10% year-over-year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $122 million, up 20% year-over-year, while cash flow from operations for the full year was $585 million, also up 20% year-over-year. Free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures was $108 million for the quarter and $516 million for the year, each measure up 23% year-over-year. Consistent with changes in tax laws and to align with our international business operations, a non-US intercompany transfer of intellectual property completed in the fourth quarter resulted in a one-time GAAP tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP rate remained consistent with the prior year, and we expect that our 2020 non-GAAP rate will be 17% to 18%. Our balance sheet remains strong and provides us the flexibility to simultaneously consider a range of capital allocation actions. We expect to continue to de-lever and pursue modest share buybacks, while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities. During the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisitions of Cityworks and Can-Net, we did not repurchase shares. Turning to Slide 9, when looking at the full year for additional perspective, we view 2019 as a year that presented both opportunities as well as challenges. Revenue grew 4% overall and 2% organically. Operating margins for the year contracted 20 basis points to 20.4%, reflecting margin dynamics in transportation, as well as impacts from subscription transitions. EBITDA margins expanded 10 basis points to 22.7% and EPS grew $0.05 or to 3% to $1.99, exceeding the guidance ranges that were previously provided during our third quarter earnings call. Lastly, our 2019 free cash flow is strong, driven by the growth in EBITDA, working capital management and lower acquisition expenses. Turning now to Slide 10, let’s go through the fourth quarter revenue details at the reporting segment level, which are presented on a year-over-year basis. Buildings & Infrastructure delivered 10% organic growth, with high single-digit growth in both the building and civil construction businesses. Approximately 4% of growth came from the 14th week. Our e-Builder, Viewpoint and civil engineering businesses each experienced double-digit growth in the quarter. Geospatial improved sequentially relative to the third quarter and was down 5% year-over-year on an organic basis and improved trend from recent quarters, despite a modest reduction in distributor inventory levels. Segment revenues benefited by approximately 1% from the 14th week. As discussed previously, our revenues derived from OEMs in China were down significantly year-over-year creating a continued year-over-year headwind for the operating segment. Resources & Utilities was up 1% on an organic basis, approximately 2% came from the 14th week. Segment revenue was up about 6% on a year-over-year basis benefiting from the inclusion of Cityworks, whose revenue stream largely consists of term licenses and software maintenance, which provides a predictable revenue stream. Lastly, the transportation business produced a little less than 5% organic growth in the quarter, approximately 4% came from the 14th week. We note that all of our segments other than Geospatial, have grown at a double-digit compound rate over the last three years. Moving on to Slide 11. Let’s go through the operating income details at a reported segment level. Fourth quarter operating income for Buildings & Infrastructure grew 26% year-over-year, with margins expanding 370 basis points to 29.0%. Geospatial experienced margin expansion as well with operating income margins expanding 200 basis points, despite a slight contraction in revenue. Resources & Utilities operating income grew 8%, expanding margins by 40 basis points. Transportation operating income contracted as a result of the dynamics that Rob described earlier, and margins were 14.8% for the quarter. Please turn now to Slide 12 for a review of our revenue mix by type, which is presented on a trailing 12-month basis. Software services and recurring revenues continued to grow, up 15% with organic growth in the high single-digits and now collectively represent 57% of total Trimble revenue. Within that recurring revenue, which includes both subscription as well as maintenance and support revenues, grew 19% year-over-year and grew approximately 17% excluding the 14th week. Recurring revenue now represents 34% of total Trimble revenue, software and services grew 9% year-over-year and hardware contracted by 7%, reflecting in part, the recent headwinds in our OEM related businesses, particularly in China. On Slide 13, I will now close with guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes stable exchange rates. We approach 2020 with optimism about our business model and long-term prospects, while still cognizant of some challenging market conditions in the short run. We enter the year with $1.13 billion in annual recurring revenue and a high degree of confidence that subscription and other recurring revenue will continue to grow at a healthy pace. We also have strong broad based momentum in our Buildings & Infrastructure segment, and we expect a positive year for the Geospatial segment, which was impacted in 2019 by OEM and China related weakness, and which will benefit in 2020 from new product introductions. Profitability will also benefit from structural cost reduction activities that we implemented in the second half of 2019. However, in the short-term, we are cautious about a number of factors. The agricultural market remains challenged and we do not believe that the phase one trade deal will have a meaningful positive impact on our agricultural business in 2020. So, our agricultural business plans for this year reflect the continuation of the market conditions we have seen since the beginning of the implementation of tariffs. In addition, Rob discussed the challenges related to ELD and our transportation business. Finally, we are actively monitoring the potential impact the coronavirus could have. Our business with customers in China represents about 2% of Trimble revenue, and this business will be heavily impacted in Q1. First quarter results will also be impacted by delays in our China-based supply chain and to a lesser extent by projects and commercial activity indirectly related to the Chinese economy. Our plants assume a resumption of more normal activity in the coming days and weeks, although there is obvious uncertainty and how quickly the coronavirus contagion will be controlled. If the contagion spreads further and recovery efforts are delayed, the impact on our business would grow. For the first quarter we expect non-GAAP revenue of $780 million to $810 million and earnings per share a $0.40 to $0.45. The first quarter revenue range assumes total company growth of minus 3% to plus 1%. With organic growth in the minus 4% to flat range, plus a little over a point from acquisitions with a little under a negative point from FX. Our cautious outlook in Q1 reflects an estimate of an approximately 3% negative year-over-year impact to revenue growth from coronavirus, and includes costs associated with meeting the demands of the ELD mandate. Our current full year 2020 total company growth is estimated at plus 1% to plus 4%, with organic growth in the flat to 3% range. Currently, we expect organic revenue growth to improve as we go through the year. We expect ARR growth in the high single-digits overall for the year, with growth rates increasing through the year. Organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be negatively impacted on a year-over-year comparison basis by about 3% due to the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2019. And that has a little less than a point negative effect on the year. From a profitability perspective, our earnings per share full year guidance is for flat to mid single-digit EPS growth, which incorporates the number of factors. We expect margins to expand in many of our businesses driven by growth in software mix, as well as recent cost reduction activities. Tempering that margin growth of the short-term negative profitability impacts from subscription transition, incremental costs primarily in the first half of the year to upgrade customers to newer technology platforms related to the ELD mandate, and the Kuebix acquisition, which is expected to be modestly dilutive in 2020. From a cash flow perspective, we expect to follow up a very strong 2019 with operating cash conversion of greater than 1.1 times non-GAAP net income. Interest expense should trend down as we go through the year, as we currently expect to dedicate a significant portion of cash flow to debt pay down. With that, I’ll hand it back over to Rob.
Rob Painter: Thanks, everyone for taking the time to be with us today. I want to close by acknowledging the efforts of our 11,500 global Trimble colleagues for delivering a solid 2019. 2020 will be an important year as we lay the foundation for our connect and scale 2025 strategy. My message to investors is the same as our employees, we’ve got this. We appreciate your support. Operator, let’s please open up the line for questions.
Operator: Sure, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Ann Duignan: Yeah. Hi, good evening. My first question is around ELD and the cost there, the actual dollar cost that you incurred in Q4 on the back of that. And what do you have the actual dollar or the EPS impact however you want to give it to us, the actual impact that you’re contemplating in 2021 Q1 and beyond?
Rob Painter: Hi, Ann. So if we look at the fourth quarter results in the transportation segment, and if I look at it on a year-over-year basis, that’s probably the best way to look at it at am op margin level and so at the operating margin level, we were, and I’d say 5 points to 6 points of degradation in the transportation segment from ELD, which is primarily threefold. First being hardware margins compressing towards the end of the second phase of the mandate going into effect. The second one were just some discrete one-time cost associated with the things like over the air updates which drive cellular bills up, and then the third impact was a bit of churn in the business that hit the fourth quarter. As we look to 2020 in the business, what I would set for expectations is a margin profile that’s roughly in line with the performance of 2019. So just think of revenue and profitability roughly the same and so we have some aspects of the business and transportation that will be improving and growing next year with somewhat of an offset in the ELD side which neutralizes that. So I would expect in 2020 revenue and op margins to be about the same as 2019. And that’s all in service of getting the 2021 results in line and protecting the long tail subscriber base that we have.
Ann Duignan: Okay, that’s helpful. And when you talk about sales in line, you talking organic like-for-like or are you talking including the Kuebix sales?
Rob Painter: It’s mostly organic, but there some revenue that’s associated with Kuebix, so on an organic basis, I would expect it to be slightly down, and transportation in 2020 that part of the down that we’ll also have in 2020 relates to our back office enterprise business – which is a transportation management system and we’re beginning the conversion to a subscription business model, which will be you know, a negative at the at the top and bottom line, but obviously virtuous to the business model as we grow the ARR in that business.
Ann Duignan: Okay. And just one final clarification on Kuebix. When I looked up that business on its website, the first thing that popped up was free software. So can you just talk a little bit about the profitability of that business and you did say it will be a drag, but is that just on an accounting – purchase accounting or is it lower margins on a go forward basis?
Rob Painter: So it will be lower margin in 2020, and there’s a, I’ll call it a freemium business model. So there’s over 21,000 shipper participants currently using the Kuebix shipping community. So a subset of those are paying participants in the model. So we’re driving shipper volume to the community and the platform to map to on the Trimble side, our carrier platform. So we think this is a – well these are very exciting space in ability, we think we have to uniquely connect the supply and the capacity side of transportation. So in the short-term, it will be a drag to EPS and we think this accelerates our ability to go after this strategy. There’s certainly a lot of transformation – digital transformation happening in all of our markets, we think are at the front and centre of that digital transformation. This is the next logical place and our interview in transportation is this connectivity between the shipper and the carrier. So if we would have done it organic – inorganically, it would have been an area where we wanted to put incremental investment. This is with the community of 21 21,000 carriers and growing - 21,000 shippers and growing this is – this to us was the best and quickest move.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg. Your line is now open.
Andrew DeGasperi: Thanks for taking my question. I guess first, could you quantify what the exact dilutive effect to EPS is Kuebix? And then maybe secondly, the 3% I guess headwinds from the coronavirus, can you maybe expand into how you came up with that number?
Rob Painter: Sure, on the Kuebix side in 2020 would be a kind of a few pennies of EPS. So low to mid single-digit EPS hits from that acquisition and the investments we’re making in the business and to grow that business. On the coronavirus so the, hey, here’s the way we looked at it, we have Business that we do in China, so called, domestic China business and then we have a supply chain that comes out of China and it’s less about the finished goods supply chain, it’s really more about the components that come out of China. So for the business that we have in China, you know, again, take the 2% of revenue. Look at a mid guidance and close to $800, $700 call it, $795 will take 2% of that, cut that in half and you’ve got what we would estimate to be a hit, potential hit their impacting Q1, that doesn’t bridge the whole number. The rest of it is really supply chain dynamic and answer first there would be about one to one and a half weeks of relevant loss sales as a result of that. So the way we would come up with that calculation is as follows. We see about a three week and so this is what’s baked into our numbers. We see a three - about a three week I call it, delay. The first is Chinese New Year was extended one week. The second is that, you know, we’re midway through the second week where factories are coming back online, ours included but most of these factories are running at about a third capacity due within – due to the nature of how the officials are allowing people back into work. And then the third week of potential delay we see is relative to the freight. So freight is moving slow out of China, commercial carriers aren’t flying to China right now. So there’s additional freight time, a lot of which is going to Hong Kong to then get out of the region. So if you take, if you add those week, a week, a week up, you get three weeks, we figure we have – we estimate we have about two weeks I’ll say a buffer and supply and inventory. So 3 minus 2 equals 1, we apply that to the relevant revenue streams, because remember, it’s not all the revenue streams would be relevant in this analysis and you get the 3% we talked about. The ARR. If I look at the ARR specifically, we would not expect an impact on that an annualized recurring revenue coming out of the quarter. So this really is, you know, mostly centric to the hardware businesses.
Andrew DeGasperi: That’s a lot of detail. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, thank you and thanks for the questions. Rob could you just speak to the balance. If we’re looking in 2020 corporates, 0% to 3%? Maybe just some thoughts around the B&I business, is that to kind of maintain a single-digit growth rate with maybe, you know, a point headwind on the deferred revenue side or just – maybe just go through the other three segments here, R&U and Geospatial and B&I relative to the 0% to 3%?
Rob Painter: Sure, Rick. So I would think about first half of the year, second half of the year, we see a second half of the year and an accelerated growth rate as compared to the first, as opposed to the first half of the year. If we look at it at a segment, more of the segment level, I’ll give you a kind of a high level view of that. Building & Infrastructure would, you know for us be on an, I’d say on an apple-to-apple basis, the strongest segment coming into 2020. What we’ll see in addition in Buildings & Infrastructure this year is the subscription conversion, which does create a headwind, top and bottom. So you’ve heard me talk on the last calls about the success that the Viewpoint business and the e-Builder business have had as part of the Trimble portfolio, and they continue to outperform well at the end of last year. The SketchUp product, which is an architecture and design business initiated the conversion and 20,000 – I’m sorry, 2019 and 2020, we would hit the bottom of that trough. So we would hit a decrement there and then really come out starting in 2021. And then we expect to start to see a couple of our other businesses with software businesses within construction begin the transition, you know maybe really towards the back end – the back end of the year. So those are the dynamics happening within Buildings & Infrastructure. If we look at the Geospatial business, I’d say the assertion we have on the year is, we start out on the rough patch because the coronavirus impact is quite centric to Geospatial of the four reporting segments. And as we come through the year, we get some of the lapping effects as we start to lap the OEM, you know, challenges we had last year. I look at the Resources & Utilities business bit of a tale of two halves of the year some of that’s a lapping effect, but to standout performer actually is our Utilities business has been performing nicely in the second half of 2019. And we expect to see that performing and driving growth in the business and some of that is acquisition, the three acquisitions, we talked about role and Resources & Utilities that we had announced in the fourth quarter. And then transportation you know, the way I answered Dan’s question, I would answer it, same when I think about the first half and second half of the year is revenue growth like really pretty even throughout the year, low and throughout the year and even.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just maybe one last question on the BIN business itself. Any – how did it perform in the quarter? And then has there been any, you know, negative impact that you could see from, you know from the Brexit, I mean there were some questions about that but anything kind of materialize or visible there?
Rob Painter: By the time it rolls up at the segment or the company level, it doesn’t become material. Certainly there appears to be some well I’ll say more clarity, I guess it’s not perfect clarity of where the clarity of where it ends, but maybe not clarity of how it ends. But that increased clarity okay can provide some stabilization in the market. What I would want to say is the segment had a – or that subsegment of Buildings & Infrastructure, the BIN businesses had a really nice fourth quarter, some of which would have been the 53rd week we had. But really, if I look at the fundamentals that our standout performer was that architecture and design business, the SketchUp transition to subscription, we saw 50% year-over-year unit growth every single quarter last year, and really just a tremendous performance from that team and showing the possibilities of expanding the addressable market through the model conversion.
Richard Eastman: Excellent. Okay, thank you much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi good afternoon and good evening.
Rob Painter: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Your subscription growth really performed nicely in the quarter accelerating from 13% to 18% despite the headwinds that you spoke about in transportation. Can you just talk about what parts of the business performed well and how big of a headwind was the churn in transport and appreciate 4 points from extra week? But still, the underlying performance looks like it accelerated?
Rob Painter: If I started at the top level, we would have expected to see another 3 points of ARR growth from the transportation business, were not for some of the churn. And then if I look at the segments that underlying the Buildings & Infrastructure businesses were really the standout performer in terms of growing the recurring revenue in the quarter. Secondarily, in our Resources & Utilities business that positioning services and I know you’ve written the reports on their RTK networks, or whether it’s our RTK or RTX networks, where we provide ubiquitous [technical difficulty] accuracy to customers on a global basis. They had another outstanding quarter and outstanding year.
Jerry Revich: And in terms of the subscription momentum, you mentioned a moment ago, the strong performance of SketchUp. It sounds like the pipeline at B&I and RTK is pretty strong as well based on your comments on the call. So is this level of double-digit subscription growth sustainable into the early part of ’20 based on the pipeline that you folks see for each of those segments?
Rob Painter: In aggregate, what I would expect to see is mid to high single-digits in the first half of the year and then the possibility for the double in the second half of the year and the delta on that is the transportation business we see getting back to where we want it or towards where we want it, I should say in the second half of the year and that would be our opportunity to get that back in the double-digit on an organic basis.
Jerry Revich: And lastly, Rob you early on the call, you spoke about essentially fewer reporting business segments and more central Trimble initiatives. Can you give us an update on your plan transitions to subscription for the other businesses based on the success you’ve had on SketchUp? Any change in plan, I think in the past, you had outlined $500 million worth of potential transition code subscription. And I’m wondering if you could care to update that and give us a sense of timing and cadence as you work through the plans?
Rob Painter: Yeah. So what I’ve talked about before, we’ve been closer to about $450 million of perpetual revenue that we have, that we would look at and analyze an ability to convert to subscription, not all of it will make sense to do. The plan we have is to accelerate the path that we were on for that. A good amount of that we’ll take this year 2020 to do the underlying planning and infrastructure building to start delivering upon it in 2021. And I would say in some cases, it’s a multi-year acceleration of the plans to move towards subscription. Two places where I would expect to see it the most on the software side would be in the BIN software and the construction side, and secondarily, and transportation and the back office software that we have, those are the – follow the 80/20 rule and those are the two big opportunities represented two big opportunities, we have to accelerate transition. I’m committed to you know, making the investments we need to in the underlying systems and plumbing of Trimble in order to help us execute upon the conversion strategy. It’s the right thing to do for the business. And I think the – and the potential is, I think, you know, outstanding for the company when we do this. And it’s more than just converting to a subscription business model for the sake of changing a business model, you know our strategy, when we talk about connect and scale 2025 is connect the lifecycles that we serve. If we’re going to connect the lifecycles that we serve, we need to be able to deliver integrated and bundled offerings of the hardware and the software. So – think about configurable packages or collections of the solutions that we have. So we think on many fronts that this enables additional opportunities down the line and ultimately, I think this can enable a data strategy for Trimble. The other place to look out for this year for us is on the hardware side. And we’ll have you know dropped that a couple – in a couple of the calls that we’ll investigate and experiment with some hardware as a service type business model. And those may show up as a term license in the end and then you know we’ll have to bridge for the Street when we’re trying that. One thing to know about the term license offer by the way, as it sits about $75 million. And that’s not picked up in ARR which, although right in the old accounting and 605 accounting that would have been considered recurring revenue. So that’s missing when we talk about that 1.3 – $1.13 billion of ARR that excludes the term license software as well, which is an attractive revenue stream, in addition then to converting additional businesses to subscription and software meets starting to make some experimentation on the hardware side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to start with the strategic realignment and sort of the business unit sharper focus that you talked about, you know, what does this maybe allow you to do, that you couldn't do in the past and, you know, sort of, you know, what's the impact on visibility, you know, having that maybe tighter span of control?
Rob Painter: I think about clarity when I think about reducing the number of segments. So if you take the construction business as an example and we’re pursuing a strategy of connected construction and agriculture, we talk about a connected farm and transportation, we talk about a connected supply chain. So this connectivity is central to the strategies that we’re pursuing. I’m a believer in single points of accountability. So in the construction business, we have a single point of accountability for effecting – positively affecting the strategy to connect construction. So the extent to which we need to make capital allocation decisions and priorities and tradeoffs. We’re doing so now within construction under one leader as opposed to what would have been multiple leaders reporting, I guess, gives the old construct multiple leaders reporting to me, it consolidates that effort within construction. So I think we can be faster and I think we can be better as a result of the structural reorganization that we made. So that clarity into direction of clarity and the priorities speed at which we can make decisions, I think these are all really important things. In terms of visibility, let’s say and if you mean visibility into the financials in the pipeline, you know, the visibility increase is going to come as we get more and more recurring revenue in the business you know as David mentioned now I think it’s 34% of our revenue is recurring, that keeps going north and there’s businesses and that’ll be a good thing for the visibility.
Jonathan Ho: Got it and you referenced, you know, maybe some impacts from I guess, you know, private investment and M&A activity in the industry. Can you talk about maybe where that’s most pronounced and you know whether that’s actually changed some of the competitive dynamics as well? Thank you.
Rob Painter: Sure, Jonathan, I think it’s most pronounced in construction and transportation. And if I back up at a secular level, to me the secular context is a digitization of industrial markets. And so from a good news perspective, it’s validating that I think we’re playing in the right field. You know, we’ve been doing this for 20 plus years at Trimble. And you know, at some point, right as the thesis played out that these markets are going to and are going under a digital transformation that ultimately is going to attract capital. Then you had an event like ELD as a government mandate in North America, okay, that’s going to attract capital on its own discrete basis based on the company’s having to have the technology and either have it or you don’t you have to have it. So that certainly created a level of disruption in the market. And I’d say disruption on a number of levels, because you know, a good amount of the competitors that came in have already gone out of already gone out of business. Just because capital comes into a market doesn’t mean its smart money that comes into the market. So that’s been a bit of what we’ve seen in transportation and in construction to an extent as well. You know, construction is such a large and fragmented business really on a global basis that I would say that’s been less disruptive. But those are the two places, Jonathan, where we’ve seen capital come in?
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is now open
Jason Celino: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Really just one for me. When you talk about your operational focus and some of the changes you’re making? How should we think about the pace that’s changed? And is this going to be a multi quarter kind of an initiative or an ongoing kind of just focus?
Rob Painter: Well, that’s thematic level I’d say it’s an ongoing focus. So and we’ve defined our strategy as we call it, connect and scale 2025. We work backwards from what we see as the 2025 opportunity in our business to get to that 2025 strategy, we were installing an operating system that simultaneously looks at strategy, people and execution. And we talk about renewing the culture at Trimble, the Foundation which is built upon inspire, engage and achieve, we inspire purpose, we engage to get the best out of one another and we orient to achieve outcomes, that I would say is an ongoing thing for us and don’t intend to change that in the coming months, quarters, years I’d call that the constant as we move forward. To get to your question about let’s say, what would change and what you should expect? Certainly, we will be talking – continue to be talking about the subscription business models and that’s something you know, we’ll continue to update investors on. That’s why we think it’s the right thing to do in the second half of the year is to have another Investor Day, you know, David and myself being new into the respective roles, and we’re talking about model conversions. It just sets up a logical timing to do that in the second half a year to get more specific about what that means on a mid to long-term basis. So that would be probably the thing I would point out in terms of to, you know, watch for the ongoing commentary around. Otherwise, the rest of what I talked about, I would say is ongoing.
Jason Celino: Okay, great. You know that’s really helpful. Thank you.
Rob Painter: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Erik Lapinski: Hi, team this is Erik on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just touching on the 2025 strategy and kind of how you’re thinking about the portfolio as you’re reviewing it? Are you contemplating or thinking about other potential small exits first as part of the strategy? Is there kind of still general – acquisitive kind of motions that you’re planning and maybe just how we should think about that part of things?
Rob Painter: Sure. So when we think about the connect and scale 2025 strategy, when we’re in the, I’ll say the strategy pillar, we’re looking at the nature of the markets that we serve. So we need to be serving markets that have attractive fundamentals, two, we need to have the right solution set just delivering customer value and three, we need to optimize the go-to-market model. Those are the three things we think about within the strategy. So when I look at and we look at the market attractiveness and map that to say, the portfolio of businesses at Trimble and I’d say that axis, the X and Y axis to think about are the 2 by 2 is going to be a financial performance on one axis and strategic fit/slash importance on the other. And great low and low in that matrix is, you know, not the place to be. And so when we think about what makes strategic fit, okay that can have a, you know, its own set of dimensions to it. In aggregate, when we look at the portfolio now there’s maybe 5% of the revenue that we think is relevant to take a harder look at. So 5%, not 10%, not 20% but 5% that does represent potentially a number of businesses and an aggregate and to the extent that I mean we believe that we can be more focused as a team and that really kind of becomes more focused with the management bandwidth [technical difficulty] more focused with capital, but more focused with our bandwidth. You know, we want to put that bandwidth we have to impacting the strategies in those five businesses that we talked about. So that’d be the – let’s say the potential exit side of an analysis in the portfolio from an additive side to the portfolio, I would expect us to be acquiring on an ongoing basis within you know say, constraints of the, you know, the liquidity in the debt structure and right deal, right time. Look at our long baseline, we’ve been an acquisitive company over time, we don’t acquire for the sake of acquiring and to positively impact and affect the strategy as we look to these to define the transformation – digital transformation of the markets we’re serving. Kuebix is of course, an example of that. We had announced there’s three deals in the fourth quarter. So I would expect you know us to be open to the right opportunities over time.
Erik Lapinski: Thanks, that’s really helpful for rightsizing kind of our expectations on that. And then maybe just changing gears a bit, I know that you touched on like the phase one China-US trade deal of not having much of an impact to improvement and kind of conditions that your customers are seeing. What do you think needs to change to actually have an impact there? Maybe how you’re thinking about that?
Rob Painter: I think it’s relatively simple. We move from the phase one signed piece of paper to purchases happening – purchases happen, inventory goes down, money comes in that is, farm income goes up, capital is outlaid. That’d be the chain I would draw on that. Now in between now and then, what we would see it say, on a positive side or positive side for Trimble is that equipment in the field is ageing. And the nature of the technology we have can make that equipment more productive. So we do look to upgrade technology that’s in the field and we’re not just dependent on new machines coming off the line certainly helps when your machines come out into the market, but the majority of our business – the strong majority of our business is an aftermarket business. And I should add for context, as you think about you know, modeling us. Our agriculture business in North America is now a minority of our business in Ag you know, we did used to be two-thirds, North American business it’s now inverse of that of the bulk you know, Europe’s now our largest market. So we’ve diversified geographically over these last few years in the agriculture business, that’s how we think about the trade deal. So I’ll be – it’s clearly a good thing that we have the deal and, you know, now let’s, it needs to play out.
Erik Lapinski: Got it, that makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. You know with these comments around a fifth franchise and autonomy, can provide some additional detail on what that franchise looks like? Should we expect it to become a separate business line at some point and how are the capabilities can be separated out from the existing businesses?
Rob Painter: Hi, Colin. So if we think about that – let me work backwards from the market opportunity that we see and we see a set of markets and capabilities we can serve on highway and then off highway. If you think about off highway, what we do in agriculture and construction, we call machine control and guidance. So that’s a level between level one and two autonomy already today. We just never called it on autonomy. So the nature of the guidance is already on a spectrum of autonomy. And we’ll continue to work our way up that spec – autonomous spectrum towards the level five. And we think the way to get there is to extend automation into workflows and you know, both in agriculture and in construction. And we also think when you bring together the whole portfolio of Trimble and we talk about connected construction or connected farm and if you really extend that analogy all the way out and we got level five autonomy at some point in time, those machines need to know what to do. They need a work order, they need a plan, they need to fit inside some other system. And guess what, we have those systems by virtue of the connection on the physical and digital field, the office, the hardware and the software that we do today. We think we’re really well positioned to do that. And so we’re bullish on the opportunity we have there. When we look at the on highway world, you know we’ve been arguably a contiguity, a supplier of high definition mapping systems. We sell a positioning stack of technologies you can trace back the 41 year history of Trimble and our routes and positioning technologies. So whether it’s RTK or RTX providing correction services to our inertial technologies to dead reckoning technologies to the GPS chipsets. We have a set of technology that’s relevant and our world is moving towards, you know, autonomy on highway. And like off highway, it may start with the automated driving systems and we called ADS systems where, you know we’re doing work with companies today, whether it’s the OEMs or the Tier 1s. And so, we see a continued same set of possibilities, interesting and attractive possibilities to us in that world. So then what we did structurally as I guess organizationally is, we looked across the company where we have let’s say, pockets or divisions or businesses that had relevant technology in the world of autonomy. And we brought those together under one leader. So rather than having a set of potentially subscale efforts in a number of different parts of the company, we brought them together and, you know, to that you know, mantra, one leader; one direction. So we feel really good about it, and it also maps to the Geospatial business quite well. So when you think about, you know, a good number of these businesses are within our Geospatial, recording segment. So we do a fair amount of technologies map to map there.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. And then just looking at the cash conversion that continues to be strong. And you know, in an environment where you’ve got persistently low cost to capital and the debt markets, you know, how does that impact your acquisition strategy and the potential to acquire some significant capabilities as you work towards this connected scale target over the next five years? I mean, are there transformational, you know, acquisitions that you’ve done and built into an infrastructure that can be replicated in other segments, particularly on the transportation side?
Rob Painter: Well, we’re certainly open to it if it’s the number is clearly if it’s consistent with the strategy. We’ve been in an – investment grade and so we’d like to maintain the investment grade status, that right sort of bounce that leverage to the parameters. Of course, you can go above that and work your way down there and in due course. You know, we think we are strategically positioned and very attractive place in all of – really in all the end markets that we serve, and we want to continue to lead those end markets that we serve. And so to the extent the transformative deals present themselves, we would certainly be open to it again if it fits the strategy and that fits the right team and the right culture fit and if our businesses are going to place to, you know, to be ready to absorb the work to do that. And I will say by way of context or backdrop on the markets we’re in, really not a lot of deals that are more companies out there that actually kind of hit the threshold of that size. And we talked about that more in construction, we have in transportation, but say in the construction market, you know, within about a 18 month – 12-month to 18-month time span of when we did the Viewpoint and e-Builder deals that small set of companies that we’re operating at scale where largely are acquired in pretty short order. We look at markets like agriculture, there’s really, you know, if you’re looking at Ag software company and there’s not Ag software companies of scale, and then you get to transportation, which is where you are and there’s a few, but many.
Colin Rusch: Perfect, thanks so much guys.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Michael Leyba.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, everyone for joining us on the call. We’ll look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for the streaming. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Trimble Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Michael Leyba. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Michael Leyba: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I’m here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release, and the slide presentation supplementing today’s call, are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast, and we will be referring to the presentation today. In addition, we will also be posting our prepared remarks on our investor relations website at investor.trimble.com shortly after the completion of this call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call, and the subsequent question-and-answer period, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors detailed in the Company’s form 10-K and 10-Q, or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today’s call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. First, Steve will start with an overview. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, our guidance and then we will go to Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. This will be my 83rd, and final, quarterly conference call. To put things in context, my first call for Trimble for the first fiscal quarter of 1999, reported revenue of $68.8 million and operating income of $3.7 million. Today, I will leave the discussion of the quarter to Rob and I will focus on today’s CEO succession announcement. Rob’s appointment represents the outcome of a multi-year process. Virtually every board meeting for years has featured a discussion and evaluation of talent with an emphasis on individuals with short and long-term CEO level capabilities. The evolution of the company has made this a dynamic process as the company has changed, so has the CEO specification. This progression has included the shift from product to solutions, the increasing role of software, and most recently, the emphasis on recurring revenue and services. As a result of the process the board came to the conclusion that an inside candidate would generally be preferable for two reasons. First, we are a relatively complex company with a nuanced strategy and growing numbers of common platforms that would be a challenge for an outsider to assimilate. Second, our company culture is central to our success and it was important to find an individual that represented both the continuity of that culture while acting as an agent of healthy change. Both the board and I believe we have found the right blend in Rob. In his 13 plus years with Trimble he has performed a number of roles that have ranged from the strategic to the operational. In his last almost four years as CFO he has developed a deep understanding of Trimble’s opportunities and challenges. He has also been a champion for a number of needed initiatives including the conversion to SaaS, improved rationalization of our portfolio and margin expansion. Another important consideration is that he is well known to the financial community and trusted. As indicated in the press release, we expect to fill the CFO role in the near future with a veteran CFO. As executive chair, I do not expect to play a direct role in company operations. Rob and I have developed a flexible range of targeted activities that will enable me to support him. Activities will include leveraging the external network I have established over 20 years and playing targeted roles to help develop specific strategies, initiatives and people. Beyond that, I hope to be able to provide him generally useful advice as he settles in. Let me now turn the call over to the soon to be third CEO in Trimble’s history.
Rob Painter: Thank you, Steve. I’ll say a few words on the transition and then get back to the business. I joined Trimble 13 years ago because of our mission to transform the way the world works. What we do is substantive and inspiring; I feel a real sense of purpose. I appreciate both the people around the world who work here and the endless opportunities that are available to learn and contribute. Looking forward, my message is one of optimism. We are poised to continue leading the digitization of the end markets we serve. Our fundamentals are strong: our people, our strategies and our technologies. There is nowhere else I’d rather be. I also want to express my gratitude to Steve, the Board, and my fellow Trimble colleagues for the vote of confidence. Steve joined Trimble in 1999 when we had $271 million in revenue. We’re now over $3.2 billion in revenue. Our enterprise value when Steve joined was about $150 million. As of today, that stands at over $11 billion. His financial track record speaks for itself and his leadership legacy, which runs deep, has set a solid foundation for years to come. So on behalf of 11,500 Trimble colleagues, we thank Steve for his 20 years of service. The bar is set high. As for what comes next, I will say just a few words here today, as we don’t transition until January, and we have a fourth quarter to deliver. Our overall focus will be to prepare Trimble for an era of increased connectivity. This includes respecting 40 years of approaches that got us to this point in addition to taking a fresh look at the portfolio, along with the strategy, structure and systems in our businesses. Now to the business of the quarter. I’ll start by summarizing the quarter in three aspects, starting with an overall financial narrative on the third quarter results. Revenue fell short of our expectations and EPS came in ahead of expectations. The market environment is challenging and revenue was largely impacted by the same factors we’ve been talking about over the last couple of quarters. Revenue mix, including ARR remains attractive and cash flow was strong. That, combined with cost control, and lower incentive compensation expense, delivered EPS slightly above expectations, which demonstrates that our team is reacting to the environment. Structurally speaking, in the last few weeks, we have implemented over $30 million of annualized structural cost reduction, which we will see the full benefits of by the second quarter of 2020. We have also exited, or are in the process of exiting, a small number of discrete efforts and businesses. In aggregate these portfolio actions are not financially material; however they do increase our focus and sharpen the impact of resource allocation. Strategically speaking, we will continue to execute on our long-term plans with an intention to exit any period of uncertainty on a stronger competitive footing. To say it another way, short-term results do not change the fundamentals of our strategy or the long-term financial model. Our mission remains the same to transform the way the world works. Our vision remains the same to deliver products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. And our financial model ambitions remain the same to profitably grow the business while creating sustainable competitive advantage. Let’s get into the financial details, starting on Slide 5. Starting with the top line, third quarter total revenue was $784 million, down 2.5% year-over-year. Breaking that down, currency translation subtracted 1%, acquisitions added 1%, and organic growth was down 2.5%. ARR was $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 9% organically. Gross margin in the third quarter was 57%, down 90 basis points, which was primarily driven by revenue mix in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 23% in the third quarter, flat year-over-year. Operating income dollars came in at $162 million with operating margins of 20.7%. EPS at $0.48 was ahead of expectations. EPS was down 2% year-over-year, driven by revenue and partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower interest expense. For context, on a trailing 12-month, or TTM basis, revenue is up 6.5%; EBITDA is up over 12%; EBITDA margins have expanded by 120 basis points; and EPS has increased 7%. Cash flow from operations was $137 million in the quarter, up 17%, and up 20% year-to-date. Free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations minus CapEx was $121 million in the quarter, up 21%, and up 23% year-to-date. Cash flow growth has been driven by EBITDA growth and favorable working capital dynamics as our business continues to move towards higher levels of software and recurring revenue, as well as lower M&A expenses and lower tax payments. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $419 million, up 15% year-over-year. This correlates to the increased recurring revenue mix in the business. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, stands at less than 3% of revenue on a TTM basis. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.13 times on a TTM basis. In the third quarter, we repurchased $121 million of Trimble shares. With $496 million of free cash flow on a TTM basis, and full availability of our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, we are well positioned to weather any economic disruptions and to continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Moving to reporting segment details and starting with revenue on Slide 7, for context, last quarter we called out three challenges; including our OEM sales with a significant influence from the China market, the impact of the trade dispute on the agriculture market, and short-term pressures in the transportation market coming at the tail end of the ELD conversion. These factors largely played out again, albeit amplified as compared to our expectations, with a combined impact of government orders pushing out of the quarter and a higher mix of subscription bookings pushing us below the expected range. Total company organic revenue growth was minus 2.5%. Within that, the discrete impact of OEM results reduced that growth by approximately 2% in the quarter. Buildings and Infrastructure or B&I was largely in line with expectations, as was Viewpoint, e-Builder and the majority of our software businesses. To illustrate this, recurring revenue in the B&I reporting segment was up in the mid-teens. Moving to Slide 8 for operating income by segment, performance largely correlated to the revenue factors. Of note, Geospatial margins were primarily impacted by the weakness in our OEM components business in China. Transportation margins were negatively impacted by spend associated with increased customer support to engage our customers through the software conversion to ELD compliance, as well as continued compression on hardware margins. Further, we are seeing bookings on our enterprise business starting to shift towards subscription. This dynamic is great for the long-term metrics, yet a drag on short-term profitability, as we saw in the quarter. The standout positive performer in the quarter was B&I. Overall, the team demonstrated an ability to manage variable costs as the environment became more uncertain throughout the quarter. This was a result of managing net attrition and tactically executing on cost-reduction activities. In addition, at the company level, incentive compensation expense was lower compared to the prior year quarter by more than $15 million. Our incentive compensation plans reflect our pay for performance culture and are tightly aligned with the financial performance at the divisional and company levels. Turning now to Slide 9 and overall geographic commentary. We experienced a decline of 3% in North America, where B&I and Transportation grew but were more than offset by Resources & Utilities and Geospatial. In Europe, we experienced growth of 1%, driven primarily by the B&I segment. In the Asia-Pacific region, we saw a headwind of negative 18%, driven primarily by difficult conditions in China, while other major regional markets were mixed on a year-to-date basis. Lastly, in other regions we were up 27% year-over-year, driven largely by growth in Brazil. Please now turn to Slide 10 for a review of our revenue mix, by type, which is presented on a TTM basis. Software, services and recurring revenues continued to grow, up 20%, with organic growth rates in the high teens, and now represent 56% of total Trimble revenue. Within that, recurring revenue, which includes both subscription as well as maintenance and support revenues, grew 25% year-over-year, and now represents 33% of total Trimble revenue. Software and services grew 14% year-over-year, and hardware contracted by 7%, reflecting in large part the recent headwinds in our OEM related businesses, particularly in China. Returning to Slide 4, let me next overlay a strategic lens onto the financial and structural commentary. The fundamentals of Trimble remain strong. Our markets and the value proposition of our solutions provide a compelling context. Our people, our innovation pipeline and our go-to-market capabilities are enablers of our competitive advantage. Our business model produces compelling cash flow and enables us to assert our strategy. Three categories of comments to build on this. First, we will responsibly use our balance sheet to pursue compelling acquisitions. In the third quarter, we acquired 3LOG in the Forestry business. 3LOG is a leading supplier of timber management software solutions, and is a strong complement to our forestry business. On October 18, we acquired Cityworks as part of our utilities business. Cityworks is a leading provider of enterprise asset management software for utilities and local government and its solutions address the global challenges associated with maintaining and replacing aging utility, transportation, and infrastructure assets. We believe this platform is extendible across Trimble. Combined, the acquisitions represent a purchase price of slightly over $200 million, with the majority associated with Cityworks in the fourth quarter. Both businesses are in the Resources & Utilities reporting segment and we expect approximately $40 million of combined revenue contribution next year. The businesses are 100% software and services, with significant and growing recurring revenue streams and we expect profitability for these acquisitions above the Trimble average. Second, we will continue to transition license software businesses to subscription business models. We won’t chase short-term optics at the expense of long-term value creation. We will also experiment with hardware as a service models. Third, we will continue to invest in our customer relationships and in innovation. As evidence, in the third quarter we held three user conferences with the e-Builder, Viewpoint and Transportation teams that had over 3,500 collective attendees. On the innovation front, in the last few weeks, we launched WeedSeeker 2 in agriculture. WeedSeeker is a spot spray system that senses if a weed is present and signals spray nozzle to deliver a precise amount of chemical, spraying only the weed and not the bare ground. The value proposition includes the reduction of input costs, increased yield on crops, and lower environmental impact. In our survey business within Geospatial, we launched the X7 3D laser scanner, which we believe leapfrogs the market in terms of performance and value. In addition, the focus on ease-of-use for the X7 scanner and the accompanying Trimble Perspective software has already opened new customer segments, such as public safety. We are also investing in autonomy, which we generally think of as automation, as a next phase to link the industry continuums we serve in construction, transportation and agriculture. Much of the IP and know-how for automation comes from our Geospatial segment. Our industry knowledge and intimacy with the workflows of our industries enables us to automate an industry process as well as a machine, a tool or a tractor. We believe we are uniquely advantaged to revolutionize this automation because of our industry and technology competencies. Finally, we appointed a Chief Data Officer in September, as connecting the data within our lifecycles is an important part of our strategy going forward. Overall, we are optimistic about our ability to deliver a compelling set of connected innovations. Let’s close with guidance and move to Slide 11. First, a reminder that at our 2018 Investor Day, we put forward a model that will produce 23% to 24% EBITDA margins by 2021. We reaffirm our commitment to being within this range in 2021. For context, current EBITDA margins on a TTM basis are 22.8%. Working backwards to 2020, it would be premature to talk at any level of specificity, but it is safe to say that we are preparing for the revenue environment to continue to be challenging given the relative economic and political instabilities. We plan to play offense on our strategy while making progress towards our business model targets. Finally, working backwards again to fourth quarter guidance. We expect non-GAAP revenue of $770 million to $800 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.50 per share. The fourth quarter revenue range implies total company growth of minus 3% to plus 1%, with minus 1% organic growth at the midpoint, plus about 1% growth from acquisitions and 1% of headwind from FX. Note that our fourth quarter this year is a 14-week quarter, and the extra week is expected to bring an additional 2.5 points of growth. Please further note, we expect restructuring charges of $12 million, which goes in line with the greater than $30 million of annualized cost reductions we mentioned. Projecting a balanced tone for the fourth quarter, I’ll highlight a few areas of caution and optimism: We are cautious on a few fronts. One, similar conditions in Agriculture, pressures on OEM businesses, and the tail end of the ELD conversion push. Two, Brexit uncertainty and potential follow-on impacts. And three, the aggregate weight of trade related uncertainty. On the other hand, we are optimistic in a few specific areas as well: One, continued growth in ARR, and our strong cash flow generation, which provides visibility and liquidity in the business model. Two, we expect that cost-reduction and containment measures that we have implemented will begin to show in the fourth quarter and more so as we come into 2020. Three, we believe customers are ready for the innovations that we can uniquely deliver, and we believe our investments in customer-driven innovations are done in a context of managing short and long-term pressures and opportunity. With that, let’s now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hey guys, I just wanted to offer my congratulations on the new roles and hopefully Steve, you have a little bit of time to enjoy your retirement as well. But yes, let me go ahead and just go with the questions. When we look at some of the macro factors that are impacting the business, I guess what’s baked into your revised guidance assumptions at this point? And what are some of the puts and takes around the macro? I know you’ve just gone through sort of the positives and negatives there, but what could maybe swing the results a little bit better or a little bit worse from that perspective?
Rob Painter: Well, on the – I think the biggest factor would be where we land on trade, if it was to move meaningfully to the positive or the negative. I think the sentiment there would be the singular factor that I’d point out Jonathan. To get more micro, it’d be a little bit of a repeat of what we – what I went through at the end. I think Brexit would probably be also on the list and how this unfolds here in the coming weeks. I would probably be another one who had that put forward.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just in terms of the OEM headwinds, are those going to be temporary in nature? In other words, will this sort of come back to you over time or do you guys have any sort of visibility on the timeframe that it would take for some of this business?
Rob Painter: Yes, there’s a couple of ways to think about that. At one level, there is little mathematical lapping effect, which say kind of Q2 some – next year or so. We’d start to lap when we started really seeing the drawback on the OEM businesses call that a mathematical answer at a more fundamental answer. Stepping back to Trimble overall, we have talked before about 15% of our revenue being OEM oriented and 85% being aftermarket oriented. Not all of that 15% is the exact same type of OEM revenue. But I’ll use that quantitative bit to say that to extent that OEMs come back that is in the ag market or the trucking market or the construction market. There’s a natural benefit from us and natural correlation we have to that. So if they don’t go up, I think we would correlate to that and if they do recover or if aspects recover or certain geographies or machine types, we recovered more than others, then that could be a catalyst for us.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. Guys we’ve seen a lot of consolidation in the buildings and infrastructure space over the last 18 months or so. How the competitive dynamics changed and how are you feeling about pricing and market share opportunities at this point?
Rob Painter: Hi Colin, so you’re correct that there’s been a decent amount of consolidation. I think if you play hind – rearview mirror on the strategy and the moves that we made particularly with Viewpoint and e-Builder, we are on the right side of that curve. We thought that was – there was a context for consolidation that was likely to occur we were on the, I’d say pretty near front-end of that and then in fact it happened. So I think we sort of feel sort of empathically positive about the timing of the move in addition of course to the businesses themselves. In terms of let’s say the nature of competition and how that’s changing, since there’s been a bit of consolidation. I actually wouldn’t say that there’s been any fundamental changes at this point. Maybe there’s an element where people are digesting the activities that they’ve done. But I think also if you really put it in context of the end markets, these markets are let’s say, construction, a large global underserved, underpenetrated, fragmented markets. And so I think that there’s a fair – I think what it also shows us that’s there’s a fair amount of room for a number of players. With respect to pricing dynamics, I wouldn’t say there’s anything specific to point out there at this point. But I certainly understand where you were going with the question. I think time will tell.
Colin Rusch: Okay, thanks. And then just following up on the discussion around automation and the recent announcement about the partnership with Qualcomm, you’ve talked about some autonomy aspirations and it’s primarily been focused on off-road. Is that changing and how quickly is that changing? There’s obviously a large opportunity set on over the road market. We’d love to understand kind of how your strategy and thought processes is evolving as those markets developed as well.
Rob Painter: Yes, good question. I think it is fair to say that we have incrementally moving more towards the automotive market, especially at the, I’ll say the intersection points where efforts in automotive support what we’re doing in the off-road market. So for instance, with the – if you take the Qualcomm announcement, it’s essentially it has our software on the chip sets such that customers can utilize our RTX correction services. Whether those correction services are agnostic to whether something’s on the road or off the road. So to the extent that we are enabling, let’s say in on highway market, we believe that’s in support of what we’re doing off-road and we believe there’s elements that play the other way where the work we’re doing off-road could be of benefit to opportunities on highway. So I do think it’s a fair characterization to say that it does incrementally have us moving more towards thinking on and off-road. One of the areas where we’ve been active in on-road autonomy, but I wouldn’t necessarily call out autonomy per se kind of an indirect way is we provide high definition mapping engines data collection devices that autonomous companies are using to build their own HD maps. So maybe that’s selling the axes and shovels for those creating the business. And then you have areas where we’re participating with the correction services on highway meets what we’re doing off highway, so quite a bit of activity at the moment.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Ann Duignan: Hi, good evening, and congratulations to both of you. And my question I guess to the run the transportation business and so I got to spend some time with that group, which was very informative. With the decline in a hardware sales and also the transition to ELD, can you quantify the impact on Q4 margins from the increased costs? And are they one and done in Q4 or will they bleed a little bit into 2020? And then how do you think about that business in 2020? Do OEM customers take some time to digest ELD get used with, see what they want to do. Do they take a little bit of a breather in 2020?
Rob Painter: It’s a good question, Ann. So let me break that into a couple aspects. So if we think about the fourth quarter and the ELD conversions, I think there could be upwards of a couple points of headwind to the margins we might’ve otherwise expected to see in the business. And I think about that almost relative to Q4 2018 when I say that. Normally we see a sequential growth in the margins and transportation in the fourth quarter. And we would definitely expect to see that again. And the fourth quarter, some of that actually just policy with the way the PTO is accounted for in that particular part of the business. And some of it’s the nature of the recurring revenue growth. But there’s a multi-year pattern that you can see in terms of expansion of margins on a sequential basis. And so we would expect to see that. We think it could have been perhaps a couple points higher or not for some of these pressures coming at the – towards the end of the mandate. And as you know, it’s the part two of the two-part mandate going into effect. To step back and put it in a little more context, I know, we talk a lot about – we’ve talked a lot about ELD and that becomes a bit of the, let’s say the highlight or the headline for the transportation segment. We do many other things as you know in the Transportation segment. If you really start to breakdown what’s ELD specific, it may be 15% or so of the reporting segment. We do many other things in that segment. So as we turn to 2020 and you asked about how that this might impact margins as we come into 2020, that same pressure I’m talking about at the moment and then to the rest of the year I think could come into – we think could come into the beginning of Q2. So more first half dynamic as those implementations, we think we’ll bleed into the beginning of next year, the first three or four months of next year at least we’re planning for that to happen. Relative to IT budgets and where spend may go for transportation companies, I think it’s fair to say that there may be some degree of fatigue on ELD spend as we come into next year. And that becomes the good news for the rest of the portfolio that’s not ELD. We do many other things both on mobility, technologies, enterprise technologies, the mapping and routing engine technologies, and so we have a conviction that we’ll see those IT budgets move to other areas. And that would inform our point of view on next year, and where we see growth opportunity in the segment.
Ann Duignan: Okay. That’s helpful color. I appreciate that. And then the other businesses, I’m building an infrastructure that business organically was up nicely. And there was an article that you co-sponsored earlier in the quarter around all the different inefficiencies in the whole supply chain, whether it’s between the contractor and the builder and the building owner. What’s the go-to-market strategy in that business and what’s the outlook for just putting all the different disparate brands together in that business for marketing and go forward.
Rob Painter: Well, first, I’m glad you saw the report. Second, it does serve as a good forcing function internally to help us work towards a common vision. And in a tactical level, so the third thing, at a tactical level, we look at the ENR 400 is a proxy for where there’s the best fit for the aspects we talked about in that report with owners, contractors, subcontractors coming together and the benefits of that. So that naturally when you’ve taken list of an ENR 400, you can imagine taking the various Trimble capabilities, what we’re already doing in these different businesses, mapping them across the ENR 400 then stepping back from that. And then looking at from a, if you may call it a key account type go-to-market strategy, how do we think about engaging those customers. And I’ll say in a more effective manner than we’re doing perhaps independently. I’m doing that more together. And then it’s just working them at some level, one by one getting off the spreadsheets and just getting on the street and doing the work.
Ann Duignan: Okay. I’ll leave it there. In the interest of time, I appreciate it and good luck.
Rob Painter: Thank you, Ann.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. And Rob and Steve, yes, congratulations.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I’m wondering if you gentlemen wouldn’t mind talking about your strategic priorities in your new roles, maybe top one or two that you’re thinking about or over the next 12 months, obviously strong continuity with management team as a whole over the Company’s history. So I’m sure we’re not talking drastic changes, but I’m wondering if you’re willing to talk about any areas there may be moving up the priority scale to just to help us understand the flavor of any changes or modification in the direction from here.
Steve Berglund: Well, let me start, because I think, and then I’ll look to Rob to carry the substance of the question, because I think again Rob represents kind of a combination of continuity and change in a single package. So I think that on the one hand, I think in terms of the businesses and what we’re trying to achieve with them in a large scope is going to remain on change. And I think my relative priority is okay. The – if you look at the Trimble’s 40 years, Trimble has had two CEOs, Charlie who is Founder and he had a unique relationship with the Board. And I came in during a period of great stress and okay, I attempted provide some leadership, but I think there’s an opportunity to – for the Board to sit back and kind of reflect of on what its role is. So I would hope that in combination with Rob that we redefine maybe a more robust relationship between management and the Board and get the Board more engaged with strategy, find the mechanisms to get the Board more engaged constructively with strategy. So I think that’s not a strategic in and of itself, but I would say that would be one of my priorities in the coming year. But otherwise I think the broad strokes remain in place. And then Rob puts his own unique spin and emphasis on those. And certainly, he’s demonstrated that while he has been the principal leader within the company on the SaaS conversion, the conversion of the SaaS model. And I suspect to when I throw it over to him, that’s going to be a point of emphasis, which was certainly a consideration in this whole decision making process. So I’ll let him talk now.
Rob Painter: So Jerry, I mean there is one element of I’ll stay somewhat high level and so far as I’m still the CFO until January. But to say a bit more, I know I mentioned in the opening comments, taking a fresh look at the portfolio along with the strategy, structure and systems and the business. To break that down just a little bit more at a strategy level and this vision or the mission of transformation and the vision of delivering products and service at the intersection of physical and digital worlds, we will continue doing that. That’s – that those building blocks have been in place for the better part of 20 years. And what I see as doing is building a data strategy to further connect the industry lifecycles we have. I think we will continue to develop more subscription business models. When I look at the people in Trimble, I think we employ extraordinary people and the objective would be to develop and engage our people even more. If I think about the aspect or dimension of execution, we have a unique, I think somewhat unique organizational model. It’s a decentralized structure. We’ll continue to execute in a decentralized structure. I mean keeping that intimacy with the markets and the accountability of the P&L that we have at the business units. And I think we can create more alignment and efficiencies around that model. And at some level change of CEO or not change of CEO, these are activities we would have been moving towards. I would really tell, we’d be moving towards anyway. So that maybe that gives you a little bit of a flavor and certainly as we come into next year. There’ll be another level of specificity to put on top of that.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then in terms of e-Builder and Viewpoint, can you just talk about how the lead indicators for those businesses are performing? What do the pipelines look like? What were bookings like in the quarter? Just to help us understand how these businesses are performing given the mixed macro environment.
Rob Painter: Sure. And I understand, yes, you would naturally see that level of detail. The best indicator to use would be the ARR. And at an ARR level, we were about 19% ARR growth in the combined Viewpoint and e-Builder business, that’s obviously a healthy number. We see no reason that that doesn’t, we can’t continue that kind of performance as evidenced the e-Builder team. I mentioned the User Conferences and just to give you a sense of momentum and energy in those businesses, the e-Builder business User Conference had I think over 600 attendees, the Viewpoint User Conference had over 2,100 customer attendees there. It’s quite inspiring actually to be with both of these management teams and then to see how that customers engaged with the teams. You put that together and it really has us feeling quite optimistic about where we are with those businesses and then take it in combination with the rest of the Trimble portfolio and connecting to what Ann was asking about a couple of minutes ago. And it sets out for us what we think is the right strategy with a lot of head room overtime.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And lastly, you really have phenomenal gross margin performance in services both year-over-year and sequentially. Can you just talk about what moved in the right direction and then that level of margins they’re sustainable on a go forward basis?
Rob Painter: Sure. So what you’re referencing are the web tables. I presumed Jerry on the services component.
Jerry Revich: That’s right.
Rob Painter: And yes, so I probably should step back for just a moment. So we are – we have supplementary web tables that we put out with the release. One of the things that we introduced last quarter was a revenue breakdown by type and the type is hardware, software, recurring and professional services. I mean, it’s an effort to really for investors better align how we talk about the business with you having the ability to actually deconstruct it yourself. So we provided that – we provide that revenue breakdown now for the company. And the goal would be, if things go according to plan next year to align the face of the financials that is the cue to the same kind of categories. The incremental addition we made this quarter was adding gross margin supplemental information that aligns with those revenue categories. And so in the web table that Jerry referring to, you can now see the gross margins by the revenue types, again, hardware, software, recurring and professional services. Okay. So Jerry, the specific question you had on pro services, if you look over the time period, we’ve provided over the last three years, the pro serve category is the one that jumps around the most category to category. And that’s really reflective of revenue recognition policies and the nature of how explain this – the nature of how the recognition can work on, if you have a percent to complete versus time and materials type contracts and how they may push from one quarter to another quarter. We had a nice benefit in the construction software business in Q3, where we were able to move to a percent complete recognition. And so we’re able to catch up some revenue and some that had 100% margin associated with it in the third corridor. So I would call that a discrete change that gave us that bump in third quarter, I wouldn’t call that something I would expect to continue on an ongoing basis.
Jerry Revich: Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Thank you. Rob, could you just maybe discuss the ag business and just where you see that business kind of tracking into your end and any positives that you could – that you have a good feel for around 2020s kind of outlook there. I mean, we have obviously the tariff impact on the U.S. business, but rest of the world as well. How do you see that business tracking into 2020?
Rob Painter: Well, I would say, at the moment that as we all know, the conditions are somewhat challenging in the market. If you do the walk around the world, I’d say there’s been more challenging spots than opportunistic spots. What we’ve – just to give you a few examples, Argentina has become a very difficult market with the political, I’ll say, instability or situation in Argentina, I mean, how that’s working out with farmers in Argentina in Q3. And Brazil, you’ve seen a number of companies including us, are mentioning the lack of financing that was in place. It wasn’t in place enough in the third quarter to be a catalyst for sales in the quarter. That is now in place. So that would be a positive thing to, as we move forward, Brazil should look incrementally better if the financing stays in place. Obviously, China lost about 40% with the swine flu. So 40% of the swine population, that had some ripple effects around the world. You’ve seen some protests in Germany, farmers with some government policy. So there’s a set of challenges for sure around the world, where we saw bright spots. I would say Australia in the third quarter was a good market for us, where I would also say as a bright spot for us is new product introduction. So at ag or tech, I think we’ll have the bigger splash launch, but we have launched the weed seeker to product. And that’s the kind of nature of the things that we need to do in the – excuse me, in the ag business to create our control of our own destiny. The displays that we’ve launched about a year ago, we call them GFX, initial had its roll out and success outside of North America. Now, we’re starting to be able to bring them into the America as we continue to add firmware, which further enables the displays to be relevant for this market. So that can continue to product innovation is a big deal continuing to work the go to market channels. There’s always an element of not just looking at what’s happening in the world, but okay, what can – we can control and what can we do better on. And so we think about our go-to-market channel, which is a competitive advantage for us and continuing to work at. In addition to the last thing, I guess, I’d mentioned is, we have continue to add a number of OEM relationships and while OEMs are challenged at the moment to the extent that we see the OEMs find any green shoots next year that would be good for that aspect of the business. And I think I probably, like you, I’ve heard some commentary from that part of the universe that’s been slightly positive for next year. So we pay attention to that as well.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then, just as a follow-up, somewhat similar question around Geospatial. I mean, we’ve had this China related issue now for a bit. Would you look at the revenue in the quarter for all of Geospatial, including the surveying business, where you referenced some government order slow down? But we kind of basing here, it kind of $155 million quarters, I mean, it doesn’t sound like this OEM business in China is going to come back. And obviously, we have this slowdown in the surveying side more domestically. But your thought around that level of revenue, I mean, would you look at that and think it’s maybe stabilizing down here?
Rob Painter: Well, of the four reporting segments we have, Geospatial is the one that we’ve called as the lower – I’ll say, lower growth segment naturally compared to let’s say B&I, where we think that’s got the most organic growth potential in it. So at some level, I would say, it remains the more mature of the markets where we have. And when I say that it’s a market set of businesses or market to reporting segment, where we have high ambitions and we think we’re taking tactical and strategic moves to enable growth to happen in Geospatial. There, I would – I’d like I talked about ag, I would look at new product categories two years ago, we had talked about the SX 10 for the better part of a year. The combination of a scanner and a total station, the X7 I talked about on the call, I wouldn’t be an indicative of really entering the mainstream 3D laser scanning market. And I would say it’s a category, where we were somewhat absent from. And we think there’s a lot of opportunity in there to grow that aspect of the business. So the China OEMs or its just the OEM business in general, we have some parts of that, we think will be hard to recover, no doubt. At the same time, some of the technologies that are for us involved in the autonomy world are in the Geospatial segment. And we think that, we’ve got some avenues of growth to be able to achieve out of autonomy in a number of technologies that spawn out of Geospatial. So definitely think that there’s opportunities for good things to happen in the business and for growth to happen in the business.
Richard Eastman: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good afternoon. I guess, it’s pretty obvious across the industrial world that the OEM business would have been soft and we saw that. Could you tell – can you touched on this earlier with Jerry, but could you just talk a little bit about what you’re seeing Buildings and Infrastructure on the software side. Is it just as resilient as you were thought, as you look into the more granular details than we can see? Is the growth rate just as good or is there any creeping uncertainty on purchasing decisions coming into the – I mean, obviously, the growth is great, right. But coming into the software side of the business.
Rob Painter: Sure, Rob. I think that there is a little creeping uncertainty, obviously clearly, it wasn’t enough to, I’ll say move the needle markedly on the B&I segment, but we are seeing some of that uncertainty into the buying behavior. Now what aspect is uncertainty and these pauses and waiting to see, which way the wind’s going to blow on some, whether it’s trade or construction backlogs. I think that part is a little hard to read or is it really a turn in fundamentals. There’s – obviously, there’s tons of different indicators out there. You could look at the architecture index and say, okay, at an inflected to the negative, but if I’m in – I’ll stay in North America. In the civil business, contractors have healthy backlog of business. They may not be growing that backlog like they were at the last couple of years. But there’s a healthy backlog of business and we saw double-digit growth for example in North America in the civil construction business and our field sales for what we do in machine control and guidance. Back to software, continued to see – we did continue to see growth. I do think it was incrementally off. So we certainly watched that and I would close by reiterating, like that ARR growth at 19% and the combined e-Builder and Viewpoint, which is a subset of that, not that leads us to feel good about the prospects for those businesses coming into 2020. We take the architecture and design business or the SketchUp product. That’s also one of the software businesses in B&I, the SketchUp units – the revenues down year-over-year, because we have converted to a SaaS model. That’d be – if you call that the bad news. The good news is that the units are up 50% year-over-year, it’s the third quarter in a row where we’ve had by 50% up on units. It’s safe to say while we exceeded the expectations. We had four at the teams done a heck of a job with the conversion that’s clearly expanded the addressable market even further than we thought it would expand. And that’s clearly a really good thing for us in the long-term. So nothing definitive, right, I can see some puts and takes within that.
Rob Wertheimer: But so far you’re obviously growing very strongly true, it is the structural factors overwhelmed, I guess. Okay, thank you very much.
Rob Painter: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: Hi. I wanted to ask a couple of questions is, first, extending my congratulations to both Steve and Rob. I’m wondering with the change in responsibilities and some of the things that you’ve talked about in terms of improving the engagement of the board down to strategic thinking, et cetera. Historically, Steve, you’ve been a very good acquirer of other companies and bringing them under the Trimble umbrella. How are you thinking about that as a strategy – ongoing strategy going forward, particularly as we’re going through this transition to more of a subscription business and trying to expand the software capabilities overall?
Steve Berglund: Okay. Rob’s pointing at me. I guess, it’s fine to answer. He’s being deferential here. So I think, Rob and his remarks talked about being what offensive or taking the offense. And I think that is still our mentality. I think that if you look at the three major realms of construction, agriculture and transportation, I would point in particular both transportation and construction and still going through what I would call a pretty rapid change. And with the belief that in the next couple of years, the end game relative to the competitive this date, ultimate steady state competitive mixtures going to start to reflect. So this is not a five year sort of DL. I think it’s more like a two year given the rate of consolidation and such. So I think that our intention certainly in, again emphasizing transportation and construction is to be on the offense, because I think we have a unique set of capabilities at this point in time and we have a unique position in the marketplace and it’s in some sense ours to win or lose and we certainly intend to win. So now speaking more from a board perspective, I think Rob is got a great deal of support and degrees of freedom to define what winning – what the winning formula is, but I think that that is the relative mindset we’re bringing. Now that does not automatically mean acquisition after acquisition, but I think that does play a role in this, in terms of the kind of the competitive winner is going to be the one with the best array of assets that solves the total problem, certainly in both transportation and in construction. So I think maybe more of an attitude than a set of specifics here, but I think maybe, they gives you some color.
Rob Painter: And it’ll just overlay a financial lens to the strategic landscape. If I’d look at it perspective of liquidity and leverage, the net debt to EBITDA of 2.13x, positions us well to be able to make moves, should they be available or we look at the free cash flow in the business that we’re generating well over the call it the $500 million range. The business produces the cash flow to enable us to play offense. And when we look at, for instance, the – we have a $1.25 billion revolver that’s on untapped and available to we have stacked maturities on the debt. So we put the, I’ll say, component pieces together underneath this that can enable us to assert ourselves on the strategic front and I think we’re well enabled in order to do so.
James Faucette: That’s really helpful. Yes. Definitely seems like you have the ability to go do things to, if and as opportunities present themselves. Rob, just a couple of quick follow-up questions, more related to near-term. First, can you give us any sense of how much subscription transition, maybe curtailing revenue right now and if that’s concentrated in any specific groups. And then last quarter, your comments around Europe on macro environment tended to center around Germany, et cetera. Wondering if we can get any type of update on further developments in that market or more broadly in the European theater things?
Rob Painter: Well, so earlier in the year at the company level, we talked about the incremental conversions to subscription being a headwind of 1 percentage point on revenue and one point on operating income or EBITDA. And I would say that’s played through the year. So we do see a headwind as a result of that and it’s a good point to ask the question, because it masks what is in reality a really good thing that’s happening in the business. Now you see that not entirely, but you see that mostly through the ARR growth that we have in the business. So that would be the answer on that one. You asked about, Europe in what we’re seeing in Europe over all, If I got the question right, any – whether I take a corridor – I’ll take the corridor view on that. We were up in Europe and it was primarily in the Buildings and Infrastructure segment, where we were up. There’s – I’d say big swings in what we’re seeing in different parts of Europe in the quarter, maybe not surprisingly UK, proved to be quite difficult in the corridor. I’d say central Europe was largely still in a growth pattern for a Southern Europe was still mostly in a growth pattern. France and Spain actually did quite well for us in the quarter. That – I know, Germany being the heartbeat of the European economy. It was up just a bit in a low single digit. Does that help?
James Faucette: Cool. That’s really helpful. Thanks a lot Rob.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg. Your line is open.
Andrew DeGasperi: Thanks for taking my questions. First, I guess on the competitive environment generally, how’s – is anything changed sequentially in any of your markets
Rob Painter: From that competitive landscape, we think we’re in a better position competitively in, we put 13% to 14% of our revenue back into R&D and that innovation engine and something we continue to intend to have a central to the strategy of the company. And if you look at the relative market share of many of the Trimble franchise businesses, our ability to put more money back into innovation at our size and to be able to out invest a competition, we think we’ll continue to be a good thing for the, I say, the long-term sustainable competitive advantage of the businesses that we have. So from that perspective, we would say we feel like we’re in a good spot and getting better if it’s even if maybe it’s incrementally better, which those are the kinds of things that can get masked obviously in an environment. Like this is, trying to reconcile absolute and relative results, but I’d say pretty much across the board we feel like we’re in a good, a good and getting better competitive position.
Andrew DeGasperi: Got it. And then just as a follow-up in M&A, I just curious if you considered or you considering expanding to new verticals or are you really just focusing on expanding the portfolio that you have right now?
Rob Painter: I would say – at the moment, I’d say emphatically, the portfolio that we have. So we don’t have an express intention to add a vertical that we’re not currently serving today and to go after that. We think there’s a lot of room within the markets we serve. We clearly serve a number of markets already today. And so intention is to stay within the markets that we’re in.
Andrew DeGasperi: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Michael Leyba.
Michael Leyba: Thank you for joining us on the call. We’ll speak to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Leyba with Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that, our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. In addition, we will also be posting our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website at investor.trimble.com shortly after the completion of this call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, our guidance and then we will go to Q&A. I would also like to briefly mention that during the month of September, we will be attending the J.P. Morgan All Stars Conference on September 18, in London. Please turn to slide 4, and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Last November, we reported strong third quarter 2018 results, but noted a number of issues worth monitoring, which were broadly characterized as discrete, geopolitical and trade. In the last nine months, these effects have intensified and were material in our most recent quarter. They are mostly unique effects that are neither classically cyclical nor secular. Although, leading to some disappointment in the short-term, they do not impact our long-term strategic or business models. Offsetting the negativism is our continuing strong progress on the fundamentals including the conversion of the business model into higher recurring revenue levels, strong cash flows, ongoing innovation, and our success with recent acquisitions. In addition, our core revenue performance in the Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation segments remain good – remains good. Let me recite the three factors, which are creating the strained results. The first is broadly geopolitical. U.S. trade policy continues to create significant uncertainty for U.S. farmers and are resulting in reluctance to invest. This hesitancy is impacting our resources in utility segment revenue performance, although we are maintaining margins. A China-U.S. trade agreement, which looked probable a few months ago, and more uncertain now would create clarity for U.S. farmers, and provide us with immediate upside potential. This uncertainty in agriculture is being compounded by distortions in worldwide commodity inventories and regional droughts. Other politically-driven decisions have resulted in a number of puts and takes. Outside the U.S. we have encountered abrupt political decisions or declared political intent, one example being the cancellation of the Mexico City Airport and another being the declared skepticism around the HS2 rail project in U.K. by the new government. Obviously, Brexit is the most traumatic event in the political realm. Brexit uncertainty combined with slowing international trade is causing hesitation to make new investments in European plant and infrastructure, which impacts us. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, there have been some countervailing positive political developments as well. For example, the U.S. multiyear budget deal will significantly improve our ability to pursue projects that require federal funding. In addition, although the U.S. infrastructure bill, which was a stretched possibility at the trailing dollar level last quarter is no longer a real possibility. But America's Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019, which was introduced in the Senate earlier this week increases spending by 27% over FAST Act levels. Although, the legislation may not be enacted this year, it is a sign of an improving bipartisan consensus around infrastructure. The additional positive effect for us beyond the possibility of increased spending level is that the proposed legislation contains specific funding to promote digital construction. Beyond the federal efforts, we also see – we are also seeing increased dynamism from the states and funding infrastructure renewal with growing enthusiasm for digital construction. So far in 2019, five states have raised gas taxes to help fund increased infrastructure spending. The second factor is China. This takes the form of declining growth and an intensification of Chinese government policies that create explicit preferences for Chinese companies over non-Chinese companies. As a result, our first half Chinese revenue was down approximately 40% year-to-year given that our Chinese revenue is now only 2% of total company revenue that this short-term downside is limited. Current conditions are nonetheless unfortunate because they make it unclear when China may return to its role as a source of long-term growth. The third factor impacting us is OEM demand which was an aggregate trade on the second quarter. Our more traditional OEM markets and timing subsystems and embedded components are being impacted by lower Chinese demand and an inventory overhang in a major customer. In addition, demand from our agricultural OEM partners is being impacted by lower demand in the U.S. which is in the short term, also being impacted by high inventory in the channel. On the positive side, we continue to establish or extend significant new OEM partnerships in construction and agriculture driven by the need to integrate the machine into the workflow of the connected construction site and the Connected Farm. The present more negative environment will require us to sharpen our execution which will emphasize a commitment to the financial model, a commitment to our long-term strategy and a commitment to exiting the period with an improved competitive position. Over the last 20 years, Trimble management has faced similar periods of ambiguity and consistently emphasized these same principles with a resulting acceleration of performance coming out of slow periods. The balance required to do this is consistent with our 3-4-3 philosophy which places equal weight on short-term and long-term results. Our commitment to maintain and extend our financial model includes a combination of prioritized efforts to capture incremental revenue, optimize the business portfolio and to control costs. For example, by redirecting efforts to upsell our substantial installed user base, we can potentially generate additional revenue and losing our linkage to new equipment sales. Portfolio evaluation is a constant activity within the company, but the current uncertainty will place special emphasis on underperforming product lines that are not core to our strategy. Cost control is implicit in our culture and we will methodically look to take structural costs out. For example, we have recently consolidated our autonomy in-cloud activities both to speed outcomes and to ensure cost-effectiveness. In pursuing cost -- improved cost-effectiveness, we will not compromise our three-year core innovation road map which remains compelling. Beyond our overall focus on transforming workflows in construction agriculture and transportation through technology we are intensifying our efforts in focused areas such as autonomy, mixed reality in the cloud. Although we have a role to play in on-road autonomy by providing precise position, our bigger play is in off-road autonomy. Although selected sensor development will be part of our contribution our primary focus will be on the higher-value objective of integrating autonomous machines and tools into the management of the construction or farm site. I'll let Rob speak to the details. The second quarter and most probably the third quarter represent a pause in our secular progression with a modest rebound expected in the fourth quarter. Nothing has changed structurally or strategically and we remain on course in achieving our objectives. Rob?
Rob Painter: Thanks Steve. Let's start on slide five with a review of the second quarter results. Starting with the topline, second quarter total revenue was $856 million up 8% year-over-year. Breaking that down currency translation subtracted 2% .acquisitions added 7% and organic growth was 3%. ARR or annualized recurring revenue grew to $1.1 billion in the quarter up 28% year-over-year and up organically in the low teen. Gross margin in the second quarter was 56.9%, down 40 basis points which was driven by revenue mix in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.1% in the second quarter up 10 basis points year-over-year. Operating income dollars increased 7% to $175 million with operating margins up 20.4%. Net income was up 3% on a year-over-year basis and earnings per share of $0.53 was up 4% year-over-year driven by revenue growth while being offset by higher interest expense and the increase in our non-GAAP tax rate from 19% to 20%. For context, on a trailing 12-month or TTM basis, revenue was up almost 12% EBITDA margins have expanded by 170 basis points and EPS has increased over 13%. Cash flow from operations was $178 million in the quarter up 22% year-to-date. Free cash flow which represents cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures was $154 million in the quarter, up 24% year-to-date. Cash flow growth has been driven by EBITDA growth and favorable working capital dynamics as our business continues to move towards higher levels of software and recurring revenue content as well as lower M&A expenses and lower tax payments. Moving to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue was $452 million up 27% year-over-year. This correlates to the increased recurring revenue mix in the business. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue stands at less than 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Next a few comments on debt and liquidity. We closed the quarter to gross debt level of just over $1.74 billion and net debt of $1.54 billion representing 2.08 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA on a TTM basis. We paid down over $150 million of debt in the quarter and have reduced our gross debt by approximately $415 million, since we closed the Viewpoint acquisition in the third quarter of 2018. Our S&P credit rating was recently updated to reflect the stable outlook which we were pleased to see. With our strong cash flow and full availability over $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, we remain well positioned to weather any debt, economic disruptions and continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Looking at slide 6 from an overall financial performance perspective the two standout metrics from the quarter include the $1.1 billion in ARR which continues to demonstrate strong and consistent growth and the 24% growth in our free cash flow year-to-date. Moving to slide 7. We have revenue details at the reporting segment level. Overall revenue was in line with expectations, albeit towards the lower end of the guidance range. Like many other companies, we experienced a significant late quarter slowing trend across some of our businesses and markets. Of note, we continue to see softness in the OEM portion of our Geospatial business particularly in China. We also experienced continued softness in the North American agriculture market which continues to be adversely impacted by the trade situation with China, as well as impacts from droughts in Brazil and Australia. In terms of where we performed better than or according to expectations, I'd like to highlight Buildings and Infrastructure as well as Transportation. In Buildings and Infrastructure, we performed well in the aftermarket in both our civil and building construction businesses. Our SketchUp transition continues to proceed as planned and our Viewpoint and e-Builder acquisitions continue to be in line with expectations. In Transportation, we had broad-based growth across the portfolio. Turning to slide 8. We experienced growth of 17% in North America driven by construction and transportation growth in the U.S. In Europe, we experienced growth of 6% driven by construction, transportation and agriculture. In the Asia Pacific region, we saw a headwind of negative 16% driven primarily by difficult conditions in China, while other major regional markets were mixed on a year-to-date basis. For context on a TTM basis revenues in the Asia Pacific region excluding China are up 7% year-over-year. Lastly in other regions, we were flat year-over-year. Please now turn to slide 9 for a review of our revenue mix by type which is presented on a TTM basis. Software services and recurring revenues continue to grow, up 27% with organic rates in the low teens and now represents 55% of total Trimble revenue. Within that, recurring revenue which includes both subscription as well as maintenance and support revenues grew 31% year-over-year and now represents 32% of total Trimble revenue. Software and services grew 22% year-over-year and hardware contracted by 3% reflecting in large part the recent headwinds in our OEM-related businesses particularly in China. Finally, I'd like to reiterate that we now disclose additional revenue details on the summary tables provided on our Investor Relations website. These revenue details correspond to the numbers on the slide. Moving to slide 10 for operating income by segment. Of note Geospatial margins were particularly -- were primarily impacted by the weakness in our OEM components business in China, whose effects were partially offset by operating and expense reduction within Geospatial during the quarter. In Transportation, margins were negatively impacted by spend associated with increased customer support to engage our customers through the software conversion to ELD compliance. The standout positive performer in the quarter was Buildings and Infrastructure. Let's close this guidance and move to slide 11. First to comment on how our management of the business translates into our financial model, strategically we developed endgame visions and strategies. Tactically, Steve reviewed our 3-4-3 operating philosophy, where we simultaneously assess and balance the model across the timeframe of three months, four quarters and three years. At our 2018 Investor Day, we've put forward a model that will produce 23% to 24% EBITDA margins by 2021. We reiterate our commitment to being well within this range in 2021. Working backwards from 2021 current EBITDA margins on a TTM basis are 22.8%. Three comments; first, we will continue to migrate business model towards subscription. Second, we will continue to invest in R&D initiatives such as Autonomy and Cloud. Third, we will manage our cost structure as well as underperforming parts of the portfolio to position ourselves to meet our long-term commitments. With that in mind third quarter and 2019 annual guidance has been reduced to reflect the trends we saw at the end of the second quarter which we expect to impact demand through the second half of the year. With the prevailing uncertainty, we believe the prudent path forward is to de-risk the revenue model and to plan accordingly around that. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $789 million to $819 million and EPS of $0.45 to $0.49 per share. The third quarter revenue range implies total company growth of minus 2% to plus 2% with flat organic growth at the midpoint, plus about a point of growth from acquisitions and a negative point of growth from FX due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For the full year we expect revenue of $3.255 billion to $3.315 billion which represents total growth for the year of 4% to 6% and organic growth of 2% to 4% and EPS of $1.91 to $1.99 per share. This implies a fourth quarter where we expect organic growth to modestly rebound. Our assertion is at the second half of the year is more indicative of the environment than a discrete quarter, as we see a pause in the third quarter that will naturally drawdown inventory. Further, our fiscal year this year is 53-weeks, which includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. For the same reason, we would expect operating margins to be strongest in the fourth quarter given that the fourth quarter normally has the highest proportion of software-related revenues and the extra week will bring in an extra week of recurring revenue with healthy margins. Projecting a cautious tone for the third quarter and the second half of the year, we anticipate the following three discrete aspects. One, the combination of drought in Brazil and Australia coupled with trade impacts in the U.S. make for a challenging environment in the Agriculture business. Two, we expect our OEM-centric businesses, which represent a minority of our revenue to continue to face headwinds and uncertain macros. Third, our transportation customers who are migrating to full ELD software functionally have in aggregate back-loaded their ELD conversions meaning our support costs will run higher the next two to three quarters. We will not let our customers down and are committed to their successful migrations. On the other hand, we are optimistic in a few specific areas as well. One, we will -- we expect continued growth in ARR providing us further visibility and predictability into our business. Two, from a cash flow perspective, the strong first half of the year has reinforced our expectation. The cash flow from operations and free cash flow will comfortably exceed net income during 2019 and that cash flow from operations will exceed net income. Three, we expect that cost-containment measures that we have begun in the third quarter will begin to materialize in the fourth quarter and into 2020. Let's now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Ann Duignan: Hi, good afternoon.
Steve Berglund: Hi, Ann.
Rob Painter: Hey.
Ann Duignan: Hi. Maybe you could comment on the outlook for the buildings business in the back half. The organic growth seemed to slow significantly there. And we considered that Viewpoint is going into that business and considered organic. We would have expected a boost in organic revenue for Building and Infrastructure in the back half. So maybe if you could just talk about the fundamentals in the Buildings and Infrastructure sector please?
Rob Painter: Sure. So actually, the first quarter double-digit organic growth in Buildings and Infrastructure had a couple points of growth in that. We had e-Builder come in as organic in the first quarter, but it had -- it was two -- had been two months in 2018 and three months in 2019. So the 11% organic we had in B&I in the first quarter adjusted for that e-Builder impact was between 8% and 9%. So if we look at that as a baseline coming into Q2, it's not the drop that it optically would look like. And then as we play that forward into the back half of the year, it's largely in line with expectation. It'd be a modest tick-down but really no fundamental change or conviction of where we are in Buildings and Infrastructure. I would expect the fourth quarter to be a higher number in B&I with or without Viewpoint, partially because of that 14th week impact and that we also tend to see a good amount of business in Viewpoint in the fourth quarter. So this factors together actually I think largely smooth what may be look optically off when you look Q1 to Q2.
Ann Duignan: Okay. And could you remind us what the organic growth looks like today for Viewpoint?
Rob Painter: So the Viewpoint organic growth is in the single-digits -- in the low single-digits. As a reminder with the Viewpoint business going through the model conversion from perpetual to subscription that's the impact where we continue to see the bookings grow stronger well in excess of the recognized revenue growth and ARR, which I think is really the metric to look at in the Viewpoint business as up double-digit as is the e-Builder business. So in aggregate the ARR growth year-over-year is above 15% in those businesses.
Ann Duignan: Okay. I appreciate it. So I'll get back in line. Thanks.
Steve Berglund: Thanks, Ann.
Rob Painter: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good afternoon and good evening. I'm wondering if we could talk about the SketchUp transition. Can you talk about the date that had your user growth look like for that business? Last time we connected, it was really strong in the first quarter. Did that momentum continue into 2Q? And how does the success in that SketchUp transition move up the time lines for additional SaaS transitions for other parts of the portfolio?
Rob Painter: Thanks Jerry. So, the second quarter was a positive repeat of the first quarter. And the first quarter was the official launch and we saw unit growth in excess of 50% year-over-year. That's not my intention to let's say I'm on a long baseline go through unit growth -- year-over-year unit growth. But I can tell you in Q -- in the second quarter, it also was another repeat of the 50% unit growth year-over-year. So what that tells us is two things. One the team did an excellent job in the launch. And the second is that it's expanding the addressable market which of course is one of many reasons why it's an attractive conversion to make. In terms of how that impacts our view on other aspects of the portfolio, it's certainly a positive indicator to us from a strategic standpoint that it's a good thing relative to that addressable market expansion. We had a launch in the second quarter in our Transportation business. And the enterprise or we call it transportation management system part of the business began a subscription offering. And that's an offering that would be about getting us into I would say into the medium-sized truck market whereas today our sweet spot would be more in let's call it the large fleet. And then in our mechanical electrical plumbing business it's also within Buildings and Infrastructure the beginnings of subscription offerings happened as well in the second quarter. Those two aren't needle-moving at this point and so I wouldn't comment on how they are moving Trimble numbers yet like the way that we have been around SketchUp. But again the short answer on SketchUp was a very successful second quarter.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you. And then as we look at the performance of your subscription business, specifically, can you talk about what organic growth would have looked like in the quarter since we still have a couple of the acquisition moving pieces? And then within that organic subscription growth can you just slip us through some of the better performing and standouts on the lower side as well please?
Rob Painter: So, the ARR was up 28% year-over-year. Break that down organically, organically was in the low teens was the growth year-over-year. So, a very solid performance from this aspect of the portfolio. If you source-trace the ARR into the reporting segments, more than 70% of that ARR is coming from Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation. So, those would be the two specific places to look. In Buildings and Infrastructure, we already talked about SketchUp and that would be one to highlight and then to the Ann's first question the ARR growth in e-Builder and Viewpoint combined. So, you take the growth we had there plus SketchUp, that's going to be what moved Buildings and Infrastructure positively -- quite positively on the ARR. And in the Transportation business, the routing mapping navigation optimization business we have as well as the telematics fleet mobility business is also a recurring revenue business the sum of which grew organically year-over-year. So, this really is a good thing for us to be highlighting in this call is this aspect of the portfolio.
Jerry Revich: And any pause in the pipeline or activity levels heading into 3Q given some end market soft spots that you mentioned that impacted quoting activity or backlogs in your subscription businesses at all?
Rob Painter: In the subscription businesses, I wouldn't say in any discernible fashion. The big movers of that are going to be in -- well, it's just -- really be actually the same parts of the business I referenced. And with that unit growth for example in SketchUp, that's obviously a very positive sign for us if we look at the e-Builder and Viewpoint. And we see these as fundamentally untapped markets, so let's say the quoting activity around that continues to grow. So, no overall -- Jerry on that side of the business, yes, it is let's say different than what we've seen on some of the more OEM or hardware aspects of the business.
Jerry Revich: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Gal Munda: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just if I think about the guidance change so maybe that's one for you Rob you guys called out accelerated model transition and how successful it has been. At the same time it's been providing headwinds right because the better the model transitions the worse the short-term numbers. So, how do we think about the model transition impact that it has had on H2 guidance potentially? Because you didn't mention it was one of the factors, but could that be one of the factors for the downgrade of the guidance or is it now having an impact itself?
Rob Painter: It's having a small -- hi Gal, it's having a small impact. I think it's not material enough to have sorry fundamentally altered the guidance. As a reference point we believe that the transitions that we've been talking about this year, the incremental transitions would have about a point negative impact to operating margins overall for the business and would impact operating leverage five to eight points. And that's about in the range. Mathematically with the hardware business contracting a little bit and let's say full steam ahead on subscriptions, okay, that would incrementally have a bit more impact.
Gal Munda: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. If my math is correct, you're implying kind of similar type of growth for Q4 sequentially -- sorry -- year-on-year. But in terms of the number you -- in organic terms similar type of growth as in Q3, even though the comp does look a bit easier in Q4, is there a level of preservatism baked into a bit more for Q4, especially because you don't have visibility there, or what's the kind of thought process behind actually Q4 potentially being weaker than Q3?
Rob Painter: Well, if we break down the Q3 to the Q4, in Q4 we would look at about 2.5% would come from that 50, excuse me, from the 14th week, so call it $20 million of revenue. So if I pull that out and I'm looking at midpoints, it would have -- it would actually be a step-up in organic growth in the fourth quarter. So call it 1.5% organic at a mid and of course plus or minus that on the book ends. So it is a step-up from the third quarter even when we back out the impact of that extra week in the fourth quarter albeit modest. And I think at that level I would reference the view on guidance what we have of taking a bit of a derisking the model and making sure we have the cost structure around that because holding the model is really central to our operating principles.
Gal Munda: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Thanks for answering my questions.
Rob Painter: Thanks Gal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Stefan [ph] dialing in for James. Similar to the prior question, would you say it's -- how much would you say is macro that's really driving the reduced guidance versus something like the transition from subscription to perpetual or any kind of delay in the project?
Steve Berglund: I think we were trying to characterize this fairly carefully and that there's a macro environment, but what we see is it is kind of a series of episodes more than let's call it a general macro conclusion. I think Europe, okay, is probably well in terms of rank order, and China is our biggest concern because of the economy slowing. But then I think this increased economic nationalism we are certainly being targeted there. So I would call that -- it kind of looks like a macro effect but in reality it's a combination of macro and specific circumstances. I think Europe, which is the second point of concern really is something the same, which is the -- particularly the German economy is very tied to international trade flows, China being at the top of that list. That's being affected and I think there is an element of conservatism relative to investment in Germany. And then you couple in Brexit. So I think we're not necessarily looking at broad macroeconomics here. I think macroeconomists still tend to be relatively positive, but it's a combination of situations. There's the China situation. There's a set of couple specifics relative to Europe. There are the U.S. farmers. So I think we're pointing at that and not necessarily saying, okay it's a macroeconomic event, but a series of specific instances around the world. And I think as -- I'll turn it over to Rob relative to the kind of the model effects. But I think we're pointing to the external environment. I think our market share is strong. Fundamentally our view in the markets, particularly construction and transportation remains pretty buoyant. It's just a series of if you will events that are -- I think are causing a certain amount of short-term pain. I'd throw kind of specifics relative to OEMs, which was not necessarily strategic to us. I'd throw that into the mix. At some point we're going to lap those and we're going to return to let's call it a new normal and I suspect, I would anticipate rebound at that point in terms of our results. So we're avoiding the use of the word macro here, and just kind of pointing at these events or these special issues around the world. Go ahead Rob.
Rob Painter: So if I was to take call it a pie of 100, I'd put -- I'd allocate a 50, 25, 25. And then I would say 50% of that would be OEMs as Steve mentioned particularly that intersection of China and our Geospatial business. And it's more embedded components, so it's not talking about new machinery sales per se, it's really specific to OEM-embedded components in the China market. I'd put 25 on ags -- at the agricultural market. And that's a function really of tariffs when you look at North America and whether -- or drought specifically when you're looking at Brazil and Australia. I'd put 20 call it a little bit of other from across the businesses, and then maybe five I would put towards the subscription transition. So as per Gal's question, I would put just a small amount towards that. So that if you kind of just kind of get a broad strokes of how we see that delta. You have the pieces there. And as Steve said, it is important to note the lapping effect that you could map out going forward. So for instance, if you were looking at 2018, and we had double-digit organic growth Q1, Q2, Q3 when we got to Q4, it went down to 3.5. So you can start to get a view forward as we come into Q4 and into next year that we're lapping lower single-digit organic numbers as opposed to double-digits. And as Steve said that some of these things will clear themselves out when we lap them.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Would you -- are you modeling in these kind of unique macroeconomic circumstances through the next few quarters, or how are you thinking about that?
Rob Painter: The way I'd answer that is, we've modeled them through the rest of the year the unique aspects. And then if we look -- it's hard to look to 2020 at this point with the -- say the number of ambiguities in the market. And so what we step back and look at is the underlying fundamentals of the business, the ROI that we deliver, the go-to-market we have around that, the new products that will be introduced as we come into the fourth quarter of this year. And then as we come into 2020, it's a CONEXPO year in the construction world. It's a Trimble Dimensions year from a user conference perspective. And there tends to be quite a lot about around these events. And so we would -- you come into a view of next year of modest expectations, but also with a level of conviction and confidence.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about where the R&D money is going in the Transportation sector? How we should think about the ramp-up in software revenue and margin expansion in that part of the business over the next several quarters?
Rob Painter: Hi, Colin. So if you look at the -- I'll say the top level at Transportation, it's clearly the segment whose -- from looking at operating income that needs to get closer to the company average or let's say get to the company average margins. Okay. Now you double-click there and look at where we put the OpEx to work. And you're correct, that a good amount of that is put to work in the R&D realm. So, a couple of things to comment on there. From a -- I'll say from a strategic aspect in Transportation, we believe we have a unique ability to connect capacity with the demand. So in other words, call it supply and demand capacity. We would have a good insight on North America based on the on-highway technology we have, the back-office technology we have. And so it's a natural extension to optimize the supply chain. And we talked about connected supply chain to also have a view into the shippers and to be able to help match the shippers and the carriers, let's say, call it a digital freight cloud. And so R&D work is being put towards that. Also, on the R&D side would be getting the enterprise or the back-office part of Transportation ready for a subscription offering. So that's an important part of the business for us to put money into. And as I mentioned in one of the Q&As, we started selling that in the second quarter, albeit in a modest fashion, but in a way we believe that that will start to ramp its opportunity to expand the addressable market. And the last comment, I'd have in R&D in Transportation is, there's certainly been a lot of work in the world of well it's ELD meets our international markets. And we have businesses now in Brazil, India, Europe and we think we have an opportunity to drive velocity and efficiency by consolidating some of the platforms that we have across the businesses. And so we've been making some of the spend to help drive those efficiencies that we would expect to see. And so from an incremental perspective as we come into next year it's certainly a segment overall that we would say needs to have that demonstrated in the bottom line margins.
Colin Rusch: Okay. That's helpful. And then regarding your comments around off-road autonomy applications and interest there clearly you guys have a long history in machine control and off-road applications. Where in -- how do you want to play in the space? And how do you see that opportunity evolving for Trimble?
Steve Berglund: Well, first of all, relative to off-road autonomy, I think, our view is maybe a little nonlinear from what would be intuition otherwise, which is, yes, we can make machines operate autonomously. We demonstrated that capability at Dimensions last November in Las Vegas. We had a number of autonomous pieces of machinery working. That is not what our -- what we consider our principal value to be, is the machine manufacturers are certainly all in one fashion or another working to make the machines autonomous. I believe a goodly number of them will end up working with Trimble to achieve that. But I think the wider play, the real value added is in terms of fitting autonomous vehicles into the workflow, which is, it's a great thing to have an autonomous excavator or compactor or whatever, doing a single act. Okay, but what comes next? After it's done there where does it go? And what does it do? And how does it fit into the schedule? So we're saying, the larger opportunity, which is consistent with what we've done with Viewpoint in particular and our other software elements, is to look at the site management, to look -- actually look at how site functions and to, yes, have our presence on the machines, but then have that machine communicating with the scheduling, communicating with cost collection functions, all of that. But to integrate that autonomous machine into the overall solution for the site, I think, that is where the real value add. And I think we're getting increasing corroboration from the marketplace in that, which is simply a simple machine operation, is not sufficient. It really comes down to how that machine is fitting into the site operation. And so, we think our ultimate value-added role is more at fitting autonomy into a site scheme, if you will. 
Colin Rusch: That’s very helpful. Thanks so much guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to understand the OEM decline a bit better and how that plays into the second half guidance outlook. I know it sounds like, at least with respect to China that's a Geospatial-concentrated impact, but we were talking about that coming out of the first quarter. So I'm curious, how it degraded from there, or if it's spread to other parts of the business, or if it's impacting the survey business as well, which was flat after growing in the first quarter and if it has any ramifications for any of the other segments more so. Because it didn't sound like in the Buildings and Infrastructure, you're planning for the second half that it was taking you markedly off-track there. So, just, if you could clarify that where the incremental impact is coming, relative to what we were thinking coming out of the first quarter.
Rob Painter: Sure, Rob. So I can give you the, I'll say, the quantitative view of that and Steve can give you kind of a historical qualitative overlay. The aspects of the business in OE -- yes, so we talked about OEMs, Geospatial, China and really it's referencing some of the -- I'll say the older Trimble businesses, traditional businesses, selling more components as opposed to end solutions. And if I look at the delta Q1 to Q2 and what we're talking about the rest of the year it's -- I don't know that I'd say it degraded so much as it didn't come back, with maybe at semantics, but that's really what played out to some degree as what we thought would be a rebound in the business, didn't happen in that aspect of the business. And I want to be real careful to isolate what I mean by, or what we're referencing when we say OEMs in Geospatial and historic -- I'll say, historic businesses we've had in Trimble, because there's really not a larger story in Trimble that -- or a thread to pull there in terms of bigger Trimble. They're really quite different. So I'd want to anchor you there and, I mean, Steve, maybe overlay context if -- 
Steve Berglund: Sure. So I would generally -- in terms of OEM, we're using the term fairly expansively here, but I would break the OEMs -- OEM category into two. And I think Rob was saying, let's break it into two categories, if you will. I think there's a realm here that's opportunistic, which doesn't -- which isn't core strategic to the larger Trimble. Things like the embedded, which are printed circuit board level, maybe just IP sales to OEMs. There is the timing business, which would be -- fall into the category of opportunistic. There is our, what we call, InTech which sells board-level product around the world. I would say, those are opportunistic from the standpoint that, okay, there is not a larger strategy or source of revenue in there, source of profitability, in fact a good source of revenue and a good source of profitability. Then there's a realm of OEMs that I would call -- OEM activity that I would call strategic, which are the construction and agricultural OEMs. There it's – yeah, it's a source of revenue and it's a source of profitability, but the larger play for us is to okay get basic capability and let's call it a basic level software installed in the factory, so that we can go to the aftermarket and sell the ecosystem that goes around it again integrating the machines into the work site. So I'd say, where we're seeing – we've called out the agricultural OEMs okay that's a U.S., and I'd argue trade policy issue okay that is impacting the core OEMs. But overall, the trajectory in that category of OEMs is quite strong. Let's call it, the opportunistic OEMs timing embedded kind of the Board level OEMs, where we're having significant issues in China, it does – and we're calling it Geospatial, but it's how we define the segment. It does not relate directly to survey instruments. That's where we haven't recovered from the levels that we established in the first quarter. So I think there's a dynamic here, but I think again, it's not – yeah, it's unfortunate that there has been a revenue decline in the short-term but it is – it doesn't really flow over into what I would call anything strategic at this point.
Rob Mason: Okay. Understood. Just as a follow-up. You had also spoken earlier about redirecting some of your focus – sales focus, I guess, back into the installed base, maybe areas more healthy and just curious what you're doing there and where you think that might be most impactful near-term?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think – I think the two obvious areas are agriculture because – and construction, but let's maybe put the emphasis in agriculture as the farmers do not buy new tractors okay? And I think by a matter of arithmetic the average age of the equipment out in the field in agriculture is getting longer. They're getting older. Therefore, the technology on those tractors is getting older. And so I think there is a significant opportunity go back and say – as opposed to making an expenditure – a significant expenditure on the tractor make an expenditure at 10% or 15%, or whatever of the tractor, which gets to be a little bit more discretionary even during times of uncertainty and significantly improve your performance. I think that is available to us. Again, the numbers of tractors out there with Trimble technology on it are numbered in the hundreds of thousands. So I think that it's a matter of kind of redirecting. It's always easier to sell into a shiny new piece of equipment. So I think we have to redouble our efforts as a company, but then also get our third-party channel engaged on this. But I think there's an opportunity set. And depending how – right now construction is going well, but I think the same opportunity is implicit in construction, with maybe a slightly different argument. But I think the installed base is a potential source of additional revenue for us. We just have to redirect ourselves a bit to get it.
Rob Mason: Again, thanks for taking the question.
Steve Berglund: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. Could you maybe discuss a little bit – I guess, you guys referenced increased funding support for digital construction. I guess a little bit more color in terms of the trends that you're seeing from constituents that are demanding technology-assisted programs and whether you're seeing construction companies actually start to think more about investing around these trends?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think – okay kind of breaking your question down into two parts, I think our specific reference was to public funding from either the Feds or the state level. We have – okay, we have acted as missionaries to a certain extent for now two to three years fairly actively making case in Washington and at the state DOTs and I think it's beginning to catch hold. I think is – the appeal is pretty intuitive, I think both at the Congressional and at the administration levels. It's appealing so I think okay we're starting to see some tangible outcomes from that the new legislation as declared by the Environment and Public Works Committee in the Senate, okay, it did have specific language about digital construction in it. And so I think that, the idea here is to provide an encouragement for the state DOTs would actually be acting out that. And I think the same is true at the state DOTs. Some are more advanced than others, but I think there is a growing enthusiasm now, okay? How quickly does that lead to tangible outcomes? Okay, that's a little less certain, but I would say it will be progressive and I think really starting about now. So I think there's the public funding aspect of it, but then the other part of your question in general I think again it's a continuum. It's progressive, but I think there is – we're seeing in a fairly tangible way we're seeing kind of the dialogue with contractors really taking – continually progressing in terms of the desire for technology. And if things slow down at all, it's going to become a competitive necessity. So again, no, it's not a consumer product. There isn't a magic moment when it takes off, but I think it is steady. It's progressive and -- but I think we're getting real traction now in a way that we haven't ever seen before.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then also with regard to potential cost-containment initiatives, could you maybe give us a little bit of sense where those might fall within the business units?
Rob Painter: Yes, I would break it into -- take a few categories. So one, I would call discretionary, the second I would look at structural and the third I'd look in the areas in the COGS. So from the cost of goods sold perspective, okay it's the usual. Let's say on the purchasing side for example okay, so we recently have consolidated some of our cloud spending as an example. If I look at discretionary, of course those are the first things you look at in your control. And that's all out of let's say travel. And then from a structural aspect, you're predominantly looking at things. Let's say you look at headcount, but you also look at things like let's say real estate. So if we look at the real estate footprint we have we're consolidating that and you can look at the list of offices and make moves that we should be working on. And then from a headcount perspective, we look at it both from an aspect of -- and it's also maybe not the numbers ahead. That's what we spend on OpEx and the velocity and productivity you get out of that headcount. So it's a mix of attrition, hiring and location is what we've tried to -- the equation we try to optimize among the structural cost side. And then when we map those levers to the businesses then what I would want to communicate is that for the software aspects, if you look at the businesses, we don't have it modeled that says, we're going to do a peanut butter smoothie and treat everything the same. That would not be a wise way to manage the business. So let's take the recurring revenue business for example, the ARR that's up 20% every year up organically in the low teens. We look at our software engineers in Trimble. Two-third of our engineers are software engineers. We will continue to make sure we're doing the right things to spend and invest in that business both on the people and development side as well as in the back-office systems and plumbing that will allow us to continue to maintain and scale that growth. I think we wouldn't want to let up on that. We look at things like subscription conversions that have short-term negative impacts. The last thing we would want to do is pull that back to manage to a short-term uptick which would look better in the short term to do nothing. So we'll manage in that 3-4-3 context to do the right thing for the overall businesses. And then as you work down the portfolio, now you're looking at some areas like Steve talked about, whether it's geographies or product lines or divisions that aren't performing to their potential or/are let's say the level of patients becomes let's say smaller and tighter -- and if the environment is going to prove to be tighter, then we know the places to look. So it kind of gives you an intersection of where we would look in the portfolio and the levers we would map against that. And we go through it in business-by-business.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Rob Painter: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks. Rob, you mentioned the R&D work on the transport side of kind of matching up shippers and carriers and we've talked about that in the past. And obviously, the big revenue industry with some inefficiency they can be wrong out. Do you have any desire to share a time frame on when that might become a more interesting opportunity for you guys?
Rob Painter: I think you'd be looking into the second half of 2020. It would be sort of a placeholder to start to see more, I'll say tangible revenue progress. We have our users conference in Transportation in September in Houston. It's in North America. It's the largest transportation technology user conference. And that's an opportunity at that conference we'll talk about the integrated offerings we have across the portfolio we have and how that's beginning to extend into a broader ecosystem. That extension into a broader ecosystem isn't really -- to date isn't a needle-mover on the revenue, but we remain -- we have conviction that this is the right place to go strategically with the business. And I do appreciate that we've been talking about it. And so it's a fair question to ask okay when do we start to see where the benefits of that were?
Rob Wertheimer: No, that's helpful. And then I mean just for pure clarity. Obviously, across the economy maybe the industrial economy there's been excess inventory that's getting wrung out and maybe you guys have a little bit of extra issue going on in China. But just in terms of the sentiment in Buildings and Infrastructure in what people are buying on the software side, whether it's through conversion or license or whatever, are you sensing any shifts there or is that still steady as she goes? I heard the comments obviously on 1Q having the step-down to 8%. Am I understanding that? I'm just looking for the sentiment among your customers on the software side.
Rob Painter: Let's say the -- in aggregate the sentiment on the software side is positive. Of course, the software side's where we have the -- that $1.1 billion of ARR. And we've looked in some of the businesses like we've talked about Viewpoint or e-Builder before that have net retention ratios above 105% and those are obviously very good indicators when we look at that. We look at the bookings pipeline that we've had. And in the software businesses, we look at the contracted backlog, which is a recorded metric in the Q. That's over I think $1.1 billion and there's a good amount of visibility that we would have into that business. That's the comment. So a delta between what would be on the books and what we aim to get or what we commit to get becomes that go-get revenue. And against that go-get revenue, now you're managing a pipeline through that conversion into recognized revenue. So in aggregate, yes, we feel good about that. You're right there is a delta versus some of the hardware side and I think you pegged it on the way you characterized inventory. So those two pieces come together and get to the guide we have for the remainder of the year.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes all the time we have today. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  Thank you. Mr. Michael Leyba, you may begin your conference.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. In addition, we will also be posting our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website at investor.trimble.com shortly after the completion of this call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. I would also like to briefly mention that during the month of May, we will be attending the JPMorgan Global Technology Media and Communications Conference on May 14 in Boston, as well as the Goldman Sachs Industrials & Materials Conference on May 15 in New York. Please turn to slide 4. And I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. We delivered in most respects, the quarter we anticipated three months ago. Compared to prior year, revenue of $805 million was up 8%. Annualized recurring revenue of $1.07 billion was up 30%. Adjusted EBITDA of 21.4% was up 60 basis points and trailing 12-month free cash flow was up 38%. We continue to expect that growth and profitability metrics will be relatively stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. The quarterly results provide further evidence of the ongoing transition of the Trimble business model towards increased software content with the growing proportion of that in the form of subscriptions. Although, the change is taking place through relatively small quarterly increments, the aggregated multiyear effect is transformational. Rob will speak more specifically to the rest of the year, but a summary view is that the Building and Infrastructure and Transportation segments both continue to operate in healthy markets. The Geospatial segment is challenged by a slower OEM demand. And Resources and Utilities is currently constrained by a U.S. agricultural market, which is suffering from trade dispute on a certain date. Although, revenue growth was at the low end of our strategic growth model, ignoring exchange rate effects we believe the fundamentals continue to support our long-term expectation of 9% to 12% of combined organic and inorganic revenue growth. This optimism is driven by our estimate of the penetration still available to us in our targeted markets, which allows us to expect higher growth than standard GDP or industry-specific growth metrics. Innovation remains our principal mechanism to achieve market penetration and above average growth. Our three points of emphasis on innovation are, to increase our reliance into platform technologies that have utility across the company, to use those platforms to create solutions that are targeted to add individual protocol markets, and to discipline that innovation within our management construct of 3-4-3, which places equal weighting on performance in the next three months, the next year and the next three years. Our innovation consists of a combination of transformative point solutions, which are targeted at individual operations within the workflow and on comprehensive information solutions that unify office and field workflows. Beyond that, our competency in both hardware and software allows us to create value by integrating the physical and digital worlds into unique solutions. The strategic agenda was advanced through a number of actions in the quarter. Although the list is not complete, it is representative of Trimble's ability to bring together different elements to create unique and powerful solutions. In the Buildings and Infrastructure segment, the recent e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions continue to enable our objective of reinventing project, delivery and construction, by transforming workflows through a constructible model. The two acquisitions are now embedded within an integrated Trimble market concept, which is delivering a continuous flow of incremental functionality to the market. The Buildings and Infrastructure segment also had two significant product launches. One was the beta release of WorksManager which is cloud software that creates a two-way interlink between the digital design and the office and machines in the field. The other meaningful product announcement was the XR10 with HoloLens 2. This is a mixed reality device in a hard hat that allows an on-site construction worker to utilize mixed reality and Trimble's unique construction workflows on the work site. Both technologies emphasize Trimble's comfort in both the digital and physical worlds as source of relative advantage. In the Resources and Utilities segment, we released our first version of AutoSync software and firmware that synchronizes materials management and the management of the farm implement. This allows us to leverage the installed base of field displays to provide common guidance lines, boundaries and operational information across all connected devices. In the Transportation segment, we reorganized and integrated the mobile and enterprise businesses in a unified, more cost-effective organization with the expectation of accelerated progress. We have now completed the process of combining the PeopleNet, TMW and ALK brands into the Trimble identity. The Transportation segment also had a significant product release Trimble PULSE Telematics in February. It connects data from the field to the back office, enabling workflow optimization for technicians providing field services. In the Geospatial segment, we expanded the vehicle-based mobile mapping portfolio that was successfully launched in 2018. By introducing a lower-priced version, we have expanded our addressable market to midsized surveying and engineering firms and state departments of transportation. In the last two quarters' calls, we identified a number of emerging watch list issues that might impact us. There were four issues identified as we left the fourth quarter which provide us with an inherent upside if the trajectory changes, since we embedded a level of conservatism in our forecast to account for their impact. The first was the impact of trade policy, which continues to create a significant uncertainty for U.S. farmers and the resulting reluctance to invest. This hesitancy to invest impacted our Resources and Utilities segment performance in the quarter which was partially offset by better performance in other regions. The China-U.S. trade agreement is likely to create clarity for U.S. farmers and provide us with immediate upside potential. The second issue was Brexit, which remains an unresolved issue although deferred. Although, the Brexit effect is hard to pinpoint in what was a generally upbeat quarter for us in Europe, the uncertainty is impacting the appetite for investment to some degree. Beyond Brexit, the European export economy is exposed to a slower Chinese economy. To the extent that these issues impact decisions on new investment in plant and infrastructure, it impacts us as well. The third watchlist item was the combination of slower Chinese growth and intensification of Chinese government policies that create explicit preferences for Chinese companies over non-Chinese companies. Our first quarter revenue in China was down significantly year-to-year, primarily as the impact of slower economic conditions on our Chinese OEM sales and secondarily, as a result of the mandated preferences for Chinese-sourced products. The relative silver lining is that our downside exposure to China is limited as it represented less than 2.5% of total company revenue in the quarter. The rest of Asia outside of China improved more than 10% and is offsetting much of the Chinese impact. We continue to believe in China as a long-term growth market and believe that clarified trade expectations can provide us with a net upside. The fourth watch list item was OEM demand, which as we anticipated was a drag on the first quarter. This is a mixed bag. On the one hand, we are encountering some short-term headwinds in our more traditional OEM markets in tiny and embedded components. On the other hand, we are establishing significant new OEM partnerships in construction and agriculture. Our improving profile was evident at Bauma, the world's largest construction show where we were present as part of the machine solution in 20 OEM booths. Recent press releases of new or extended OEM partnerships have included Kobelco, Liebherr, Doosan and Volvo. Strategically, our primary market focus is not on OEMs, but remains on the end user, which accounted approximately 85% of our 2018 revenue. The logic is that those end users principally farmers, contractors and trucking operators live in a mixed fleet universe and it is important that OEMs operate within an interoperable hopefully Trimble-centric technology ecosystem. Another positive external consideration remains the U.S. infrastructure bill, albeit with a still unclear probability. Both political parties support the concept of a significant increase in infrastructure spending, but both are struggling with finding a funding mechanism. If a bill should pass, we expect that it will contain elements that will promote more cost-effective spending through an emphasis on digital construction. Passage of a bill would have an immediate move-the-needle impact on results in multiple reporting segments. In summary, despite some uncertainties, we remain on track strategically and anticipate strengthening organic performance during the rest of 2019. Let me turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn on slide 5 with a review of the first quarter results. Starting with the top-line, first quarter total revenue was a little less than $805 million growing 8% year-over-year. Breaking that down currency translation subtracted 2% and acquisitions added 7%. Organic growth was 3%. ARR or Annualized Recurring Revenue grew to $1.07 billion in the quarter up 30% year-over-year and up in the low-teens organically. Gross margin in the first quarter was 58% up 90 basis points, which came from a combination of M&A and organic growth. While the adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.4% in the quarter up 60 basis points year-over-year. Operating income dollars increased 8.3% to $152.9 million with operating margins of 19%. While operating income dollars increased net income was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis and earnings per share at $0.45 was also flat year-over-year. This was a result of higher interest expense and the increase in our non-GAAP tax rate from 19% to 20%. For additional context on a trailing 12-month basis, revenue was up by 15%. EBITDA margins have expanded by 220 basis points and EPS has increased to 23%. Cash flow from operations was $148 million up 78% year-over-year and up 35% on a trailing 12-month basis. Free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures was $133 million in the quarter and was up 38% on a trailing 12-month basis. Cash flow growth in the quarter was driven by operating income growth, favorable working capital dynamics and lower acquisition expenses as compared to the first quarter of 2018. Moving to the balance sheet. Our business model continues to be asset-light. Deferred revenue was $464 million up 29% year-over-year. This correlates to the increasing recurring revenue mix in the business. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue stands at 3% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Next a few comments on debt and liquidity. We closed the quarter at a gross debt level of just over $1.89 billion and net debt of $1.68 billion representing 2.31 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis. Less than a year ago, we stated that we would delever to under 2.5 times within 24 months of our acquisition of Viewpoint and we have achieved that in less than 12 months due to strong cash flow and EBITDA progression over the past few quarters as well as by continuing to pay down the debt itself. As evidenced, we paid down an additional $73 million of debt in the quarter and have reduced our gross debt by approximately $300 million since we closed the Viewpoint acquisition in the third quarter of 2018. For perspective, on our liquidity, we have borrowing capacity on virtually all of our $1.25 billion revolver. The point is that our business model works, our balance sheet is resilient and well designed with well staggered maturities on the debt and ample liquidity should we need it. In addition to the repayment of debt in the quarter, we also repurchased $40 million of our stock. From an overall financial performance perspective, I would like to highlight and emphasize three metrics from the quarter. First, our annualized recurring revenue continues to demonstrate strong and consistent growth, reflecting the ever-increasing software and subscription content within our business mix. Second, the growth in our free cash flow demonstrates our technology orientation and the asset-light-centricity of our business model. Third, our ability to delever rapidly following a large acquisition, such as Viewpoint, further evidences the cash generation capability of our business model. Let's move to Slide 7. We have revenue details at the reporting segment level. Overall, revenue was in line with expectations. As is the case in every quarter, there were puts and takes. We continue to see softness in the OEM portion of our Geospatial business particularly in China. We also saw a continued softness in the North American agricultural market, which has been adversely impacted by the trade situation with China. And finally, we experienced discrete delays and project completion sign-offs that postponed the capture of revenue in the quarter. In terms of where we performed better than expected, I'd like to highlight Buildings and Infrastructure as well as Transportation. In Buildings and Infrastructure, we outperformed in the aftermarket in both civil and building construction. Two notable highlights. First, the subscription transition in the SketchUp business has been successfully received with a better-than-expected mix of subscriptions, which negatively impacted short-term revenue, but was then partially offset by higher-than-expected unit growth. Second, our Viewpoint and e-Builder acquisitions were in line with expectations. Subscription bookings growth continued to be strong and ARR for the two acquired businesses combined was up approximately 20% year-over-year. In Transportation, the truck routing mapping and navigation business was a standout performer in the quarter with a difficult prior year comparison. Moving to slide 8. Our overall geographic revenue mix remained relatively unchanged on a year-over-year basis. We experienced growth of 10% in North America driven by construction growth in the U.S. In Europe, we experienced growth of 10% with general growth across the region including the U.K. In the Asia Pacific region, we saw a slight headwind of negative 1%, driven mostly by difficult conditions in China, while other major regional markets were up. And lastly, in other regions we were up 3%, including contributions from a recent acquisition of Veltec in Brazil. Please now turn to slide 9 for a review of our revenue mix by type, which is presented on a trailing 12-month basis. Software services and recurring revenue continued to grow up 28% with organic growth rates in the low teens. This now represents 53% of total Trimble revenue. Within that recurring revenue, which includes both subscription as well as maintenance and support revenues grew 29% year-over-year and now represents 31% of total Trimble revenue. Software and services grew 27% year-over-year and the hardware has grown at a low single-digit rate, reflecting in large part the recent headwinds in our OEM-related businesses as well as difficult comparisons in Transportation from the Phase one implementation of the ELD mandate a year ago. Lastly, I would like to mention that, starting this quarter, we have disclosed additional revenue details on the summary tables provided on our Investor Relations website. These revenue details correspond to the numbers on this slide. Next let's turn to slide 10, where we have the operating income details by segment. In short, the operating income results are consistent with the revenue commentary with Buildings and Infrastructure as the strongest performer. Resources and Utilities and Geospatial margins reflected and were impacted by the aforementioned revenue dynamics, while Transportation margins were largely in line with expectations and are expected to expand in the second half of the year. Moving now to guidance on slide 11, overall, we continue to see the year playing out as we discussed in last quarter's earning call, with organic growth, margins and earnings growth improving throughout the year, coupled by a continued shift towards software and subscription revenues. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of $850 million to $880 million, and EPS of $0.52 to $0.56 per share. The second quarter revenue range implies total company growth of 8% to 12%, with organic growth in the 3% to 7% range, plus 7% from acquisitions, less 2% from FX due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our second quarter organic growth guidance reflects an expected improvement from the first quarter, which does not assume macro level improvements and is driven by two factors. First, the second quarter is traditionally the strongest quarter for civil construction. Second, in Transportation, we will have lapped the ELD related installation surge. One comment on cash flow for the second quarter, please note that while we accrue interest quarterly, the cash interest payments take place in the second and fourth quarters. For the full year, we are reaffirming the view we discussed last quarter, expecting full year company growth in the 6% to 10% range with organic growth of 4% to 7%, 3% or 4% from acquisitions and a negative 1% from currency impacts. We continue to expect organic revenue growth and operating margins to improve through the year with EPS growth in the high-single-digits for the full year with double-digit EPS growth in the back half of the year. From a revenue seasonality perspective, let's step through the sequential quarters. We expect second quarter revenue to be the highest revenue in the year, which is normal given that it represents the peak of the construction season. In the third quarter, we expect slightly lower sequential revenue, reflecting an expected seasonal summer dynamic. Finally, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be sequentially above third quarter revenue, in part because our fiscal year this year is 53 weeks, which includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. For this same reason, we would expect operating margins to be strongest in the fourth quarter given that the fourth quarter normally has the highest proportion of software-related revenues and the extra week will bring in an extra week of recurring revenue with healthy margins. From a cash flow perspective, the strong first quarter reinforced our expectation that cash flow from operations and free cash flow will grow faster than net income during 2019, and the cash flow from operations will exceed net income. From a capital allocation standpoint, we expect we will continue to delever while selectively evaluating buyback and M&A based on market conditions and available opportunities. In closing, the guidance for the second quarter and the full year reaffirms our previous guidance for the first half of 2019 as well as the overall year. Let's now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good afternoon. And just wanted to congratulate you on the solid results here just given the challenges that are out there. Can you maybe give us a little bit of a sense of maybe how you see the situation around the macro unfolding and perhaps some of these headwinds from China? Are there steps that you can take to sort of mitigate what's happening there, and just any sort of broader thoughts around those topics?
Steve Berglund: Well, I don't know that we've got, let's call it particularly great insight compared to what is already available to you. But, certainly what we're seeing is that Europe continues to remain generally strong. We look in the direction of Germany, which is being affected by China maybe more than others in terms of its export markets, and whether that will put a damper on investment. But, so far it's holding up. There's, of course, the Brexit issue that will have a specific impact on UK potentially, but then the rest of Europe. So Europe -- but, Europe seems to be comparatively robust with some puts and takes. Brazil. Brazil is a market that's been very strong for us for quite a while in agriculture, but I think we're beginning to get a sense and our belief system is strengthening that Brazil is potentially an upside market relative to the other markets. We now have a position in Transportation in Brazil with the acquisition of Veltec and then we believe that we are seeing kind of call it greater potential for construction. So I think Brazil has a possibility of entering into our dialogue more generally across the company not just in agriculture. So hoping -- Argentina of course is on the other end of that spectrum, which is comparatively troubled at that point in time. But -- and then China, okay China has something of a wait-and-see. I think that even in a diminished growth market in China there are opportunities. Now we are currently in a position where we've got specific issues with some specific OEMs in China. Okay. As we work through those, I think we're back to let's call it the long-term trend line in China. And under normal circumstances I think that we find China attractive even at diminished growth prospects. So I think there's plenty of market there to be had. I think the -- where we're waiting to see about what's actually in any potential U.S.-China trade pack is about relative access. As I said in the script, China is more -- maybe has intensified since the beginning of the trade issues with the U.S. has intensified their relatively preference for local companies, if -- as part of the trade. Any trade agreement that that would re-equalize the level of playing field we would more have confidence. But I think China is just a place of caution at this point in time. Hopefully, we get some clarity in the near future on that relative to at least the trade situation. Japan, we are doing -- is quite an attractive market for us at this point in time in part being boosted by Olympic-related spending and such. But Japan's -- against the 10-year standard is doing quite well at this point in time. South Africa which is always been a relatively strong market for us is struggling at this point in time. So I think I have more or less covered the world there. But -- so I'd say steady as you go. Watching China and of course the U.K. particularly closely at this point.
Jonathan Ho: Thanks for the color. That's super helpful. Just one other one for me. In terms of the infrastructure bill, you guys talked about seeing -- potentially -- needle-moving benefit. How should we think about those potential impacts?
Steve Berglund: Jonathan you kind of faded out there for a second. I think I got it, but can you just repeat the question?
Jonathan Ho: Sorry just regards to the infrastructure bill, where would you potentially see those immediate impacts take place?
Steve Berglund: Well, if an infrastructure bill is passed and is truly an infrastructure bill that means roads and bridges and things like that as opposed to let's call it other extraneous spending that sometimes wanders into the infrastructure bill. I think -- I believe there would be an immediate impact for us, because I think that contractors seeing a more certain flow of projects would start to build the capability to effectively compete for those projects. In our view that leads straight back to investment and technology to be able to bid aggressively as well as control the projects. So I think that what we would see before any money actually get spent, we would see an investment by contractors, anticipating the money flow and getting ready to be competitive in the bidding process. So I would see that as the dynamic is that we would not necessarily have to wait. Yes, because when the money starts to flow, it would be enhanced, but I think there would be immediate effect in terms of anticipating and getting ready for money flow.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone.
A – Rob Painter: Hi Jerry.
Q – Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you folks can talk about the bookings growth performance on e-Builder and Viewpoint particularly with subscription bookings what was that performance like this quarter. And then, you guys spoke about SketchUp being ahead of expectations maybe touch on that as well first.
A – Rob Painter: Sure. So, we shifted – Jerry, we shifted the commentary on the acquisitions, the recent acquisitions to an ARR, in terms of the disclosure going forward. I think given that both businesses are 75 -- more than 75% of recurring revenue. The real metric we think to pay attention to is this recurring -- or excuse me is the ARR that gives you the best sense of how the business is performing. The other -- but in short, to give you just a little bit of flavor of the booking they continue to be strong double-digit growth in year-over-year bookings on Viewpoint and e-Builder. And for a little more color on the SketchUp business, we went into the quarter expecting – well, this is the first quarter of the transition, official transition out of data, went it expecting a higher mix of perpetual to subscription because we do offer both. And it was the inverse. And we really saw the big uptick in the subscriptions. And so I would say it was a nice upside. It really to us at least as an early indicator what appeared to show, that it's a way to increase the size of the addressable market.
Q – Jerry Revich: Okay. And then Rob, you mentioned on your ARR metric the organic growth was double-digits. Can you just say that's around the major pieces? We covered a few of them here, but can you comment on the transportation and logistics, the subscription business how that's tracking? And any parts of the subscription portfolios that are weaker for us to keep an eye on as well? Any comments there would be helpful.
A – Rob Painter: Well, good news would be there are no meaningful weaknesses to speak of in the subscription business taking a walk around the company, in the transportation business. We continue to grow the subscription base. Our enterprise offering which is the back office transportation management software is beginning to offer, a subscription model to a customer base. And that allows us to penetrate a part of the market that we think we weren't accessing before. Still very early days, so that's all in that I would say upside from a subscription point of view. When we look at the one I called out as the standout performer was the routing, mapping and navigation software which continues to find its way to new logo acquisition through market segmentation. And the team's done a really nice job of identifying, vertical markets and working backwards from those markets and putting product and go-to-market plans around that. And from -- if I step next into the Resources and Utilities the correction service business we have which is a subscription business continues to grow. And when you look at units there are customer accounts, so healthy growth there in the business. And then, when we go to the Geospatial, it doesn't have meaningful subscription to speak of. So then going to Building, an Infrastructure market and looking at the rest of the software portfolio that we have there particularly in the BIM-related construction software space the really the business overall has performed performing quite well double-digit growth currency neutral, double-digit growth in those businesses. So, really nice set of performances in all I'd say the software businesses in aggregate and double-clicking on that within subscription in particular.
Q – Jerry Revich: Yeah. And in your prepared remarks you folks included a lot of discussion on the puts and takes around what could drive the hardware part of the business. Can you just talk about the subscription and the recurring revenue piece if we do -- if you hit pockets of the slower growth? And what are your expectations for the resilience of the recurring revenue piece and the subscription piece within that specifically?
A – Rob Painter: Well, our belief that, would be that there is a higher degree of resilience in that revenue stream for starters. Of course we'd say if you take ARR at $1.07 billion coming out of the quarter, we've got line of sight to that $1.07 billion 12 months forward. Now what you have to do, of course, there is to retain that revenue base and -- which is a way of saying don't turn that revenue base if there were to be a bigger pocket -- air pocket in the economy. But at some level, time will tell how the resilience holds up. But from our view that we have of it right now we feel like -- and our track record would suggest that we have a very high degree of retention. You've heard me talk before about the Viewpoint and e-Builder businesses where our net retention ratio is greater than 100% so we're penetrating existing customers and cross-selling greater than return customers which is a really incredible part of those business models of those two businesses. So, in aggregate, Jerry, I would say the resilience factor is markedly higher in that revenue stream as opposed to others and we have still evidence of that in the quarter. I mean, clearly, the hardware growth was lower than that of the software and the perpetual software growth was lower than that of the subscription.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann Duignan: Hi. This is Ann Duignan. Good afternoon, good evening. Steve, maybe I'll start with your comments on infrastructure spending and infrastructure projects. I think you've probably been around long enough to remember the shovel-ready program that were put in place back in 2008 or 2009 where literally all that happened both state and local governments stop spending, because the money was all coming from the federal government. And so net-net, we didn't really see any positive impact from that school of projects. So, I'm just curious why you think that this infrastructure spending bill could be different. And what's the probability of it getting signed before the next election or at all given where the funding debts are?
Steven Berglund: Yeah. Without a doubt Ann, skepticism perhaps even cynicism is appropriate here. You are right is -- the 2008/2009 version so-called shovel-ready was, yeah, a mystery act where -- when one pocket came up, the other pocket in some fashion state and federal. So I don't know for sure that -- with any certainty that this will be different. But good news is we have no upside at all built into our forecast so anything that will come out of it would be upside. I think that we have actually spent a reasonable amount of time in Washington, with trade groups and whatever. I think maybe the tone within the Department of Transportation is perhaps different this time. There is a level of seriousness there. Now whether that can be brought through the political process without getting mutated into non-recognition is an open question. So I think the outcome is still very much in doubt. I think if you listen to the rhetoric from the two sides, they're talking maybe two different things. One side is maybe talking more about highways and bridges. The other is talking about broadband, infrastructure and such. So it's not at all clear what the actual substance would be. So recognize that. And again, we're not counting on anything. We're not building on anything. Now I think in terms of relative probabilities here against the standard of three to six months ago, I think that there is maybe marginally more room for optimism. I think that -- again the meeting -- the recent meeting between the President and the Democratic political leadership in the House and Senate -- okay, that was for public consumption. There is still no agreement on funding, but okay, it is -- it does represent something. And I think if you look at the -- look particularly on the House side, I think Congressman DeFazio is very -- seems to be very much determined to get something done. Ultimately, the issue is one of funding sources and I think that still remains the great divide between the two sides. But again, I think in terms of relative activity and relative profile, I think it is much more active today than it was six months ago. So, we'll just wait and see. But if it did happen, it would be a big deal for us. But we're -- in the meantime, we're assuming basically zero impact in our forecast. So we're hunkered down, waiting for something to happen. But, I think, maybe, the probabilities are somewhat better than they were six months ago, but probably, realistically not very high.
Ann Duignan: Thank you. I appreciate the color and the cynicism. Maybe switching gears a little bit to bauma and the construction side. Trimble really did display its products on a variety of different OEM exhibits. And I'm just curious, as you build up equipment on more and more OEM excavators, et cetera, does that drive back up your hardware percent of sales back towards the 50% versus 47%, where it's at today? I mean, it's a nice problem to have, but does it change the mix again?
Steve Berglund: I guess at least in the abstract it would probably in the short term. But, again, I think, the -- at least over time I think our view of what's actually happening is, we put the hardware on the machine. And, okay, the machine hooks into a, let's call it a network, into an information system. And then, subsequent to putting the equipment, the sensors on the machine, if you will, the capabilities on the machine, there's a subsequent software sale. So, actually, I would think over a period of time it would not really alter the equation between hardware and software. If anything, it would probably boost software faster than the hardware. I don't think we've got, let's call it, particularly intricate model of it. But, I think, the hardware feeds the software. The hardware supports the software. And ultimately, we see it more as a software play in the longer term than a hardware play.
Ann Duignan: Okay. I appreciate the color. That’s interesting. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good afternoon. Can I just ask maybe a higher-level question? When I look at the operating profit in all four of the segments, what kind of steps out of me is that, again, OpEx must be -- must have kind of crept up in all four segments or -- what I'm trying to get at is, your gross margin -- adjusted gross margin is up 100 basis points to 58% company-wide. I assume that's kind of software creep, so that's good. But when I look at the segment profit by all four segments, it's all -- you get some incrementals. I think in Transportation, it's 19%. Maybe 25% in BIM or in -- yes, B&I. But I'm just trying to get a sense of -- is there -- within any of the four segments, is there some intended incremental spend that's kind of pulling down either the incremental or driving up the OpEx? Or is -- what we're seeing mainly just absorption on the lowest revenue quarter of the year?
Rob Painter: Hey, Rick, it's Rob.
Richard Eastman: Yes.
Rob Painter: There're probably a couple of things in there to unpack. I'd start by saying, really, it's largely in line with the expectations we had coming into the quarter when we look at the margins by the reporting segments. One thing to -- I'll say to note in the business model, as we become more software-centric is, R&D arguably is a proxy for cost of goods sold. And so, for software companies, we would tend to expect to see higher gross margin and -- but at the same time some higher OpEx on -- let's say, on a comparable basis versus our hardware businesses, so just one thing to note in terms of the mix that we might see going forward. You clearly saw the 100 -- or the 90 bps of improvement on the gross margins on a year-over-year basis, which would reflect that. Some of the OpEx, of course, now in B&I segment you're going to see the Viewpoint in the quarter in 2019 that you wouldn't have seen in 2018. So that would make it really difficult around a comparison that's tough to make. Otherwise, when you step through the other segments, the Transportation is as we expected. We have been spending more on R&D in that area and that's been intentional there. And then where Geospatial would have looked a little off on a model would have been a shortfall on the OEM-centric revenue within the Geospatial.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Maybe I can follow up with that just a little more detail. I think trying to ask big picture, but it's a little bit more detail. But I mean can I just ask maybe a follow-up question in the Building & Infrastructure segment of the business? Can you just tease out the growth rates for the BIM business and the civil construction? And was this core of engineers' softness that we saw at the end of last year? Did that to carry into the civil construction business? Is there still a drag there?
Rob Painter: So there's the risk -- answer the last part first. There is still a slight drag on a year-over-year basis. The -- that business was in line with our expectations for the quarter though. So there wasn't any surprise there for us whereas we did have some surprise to the downside in the back half of last year. But the comp is a tough comp for us in that business. The thing -- one of the things to note about the federal business is that a good amount of the Fed business is program-driven. And so the timing of when a program hits and delivers can vary year-to-year quarter-to-quarter, a quarterly view only of federal business is inherently incomplete and could lead to conclusions too good or too negative one way or the other depending on the comparable. So the main thing I'd want to hear on the Fed business is it was as is expected. When you look at it on with comparable basis on a year-over-year, what would have masked in aggregate is that the field sales which is that aftermarket when we talked about 85% of our revenue is Trimble is serving the end-user. That business was strong for us and civil construction was up double-digit year-over-year as was the building construction and the BIM-centric software businesses in constant currency basis double-digit growers. So very good performance at the end-user level on both segments.
Richard Eastman: I see. Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Gal Munda with Berenberg.
Gal Munda: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. And the first one I have just in terms of the quarter versus the year how it's kind of shaping up. You kept your guidance for the year. When you look at the quarter performance, how does it compare to what you expected going into that -- in terms of the segment? Would you say that Building and Infrastructure performed slightly better than you expected? And maybe Geospatial alike or was it exactly in line? Because I just wanted to kind of clarify that.
Rob Painter: Hi, Gal. So the Buildings & Infrastructure and Transportation were above -- slightly about the expectations we had, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities slightly below and netted to the numbers that we walked through at the aggregate level. They're not dramatically above or below puts and takes level. But the one that would have been the strongest performer was Buildings & Infrastructure by really most any metric and it had the highest expectations for us as we came into the quarter. And what -- can you repeat your other question Gal?
Gal Munda: So the other question is actually just trying to look -- focus on free cash flow for a second. You made an interesting comment of the drivers of the free cash flow which doubled year-on-year. When I look at your business today now that it's more than half of it's software and you're transitioning towards subscription model is it fair to say that net working capital should decrease as a proportion of revenue going forward? In other words have lowering net working capital especially because of the deferred revenue growth expectations is that something we could continue seeing over the midterm or not just in any given quarter?
Rob Painter: I think it is a reasonable assumption Gal that the working capital would continue to go down. Now it's already quite low. It's at 3% of revenue. So if that heads closer to 0 or negative that's possible. I don't know that that would be fundamental shift for us. I think one thing we would keep in mind we would be looking at as we move more to subscription businesses from the payment term perspective for billing annually versus quarterly that could have dynamics on the cash over time as opposed to let's say perpetual license, if I'm taking that revenue all upfront. So the way in which we bill the customers, we would pay attention to that. But the general business model does tend to be a prepayment and therefore a pickup in deferred.
Q – Gal Munda: Perfect. And just the last thing to clarify on that, do you guys have any multiyear contracts? In other words would you have any unbilled deferred revenues which would be off balance sheet? Or is this not significant for you?
A – Rob Painter: So the -- well actually one of the disclosures posed in the 606 shows the backlog. So there's a backlog of over $1 billion that's disclosed in the Q and it shows a breakdown over tranches of time. I think 76%, 78% of that is within 12 or so months. So there's a -- and that backlog is backlog that's contracted backlog. And as I said, contracted and unbilled backlog
Q – Gal Munda: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
A – Rob Painter: And that backlog does include some of the deferred.
Q – Gal Munda: Sure.
Operator: And your next question is from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Q – Kristen Owen: Hi, good evening. This is Kristen on for Colin. Thank you for taking our questions.
A – Rob Painter: Hi, Kirsten.
Q – Kristen Owen: So just wanted to follow up on the strong organic growth that you saw in Buildings and Infrastructure, how much of that do you attribute to some of the cross-selling opportunities that you're seeing as a result to the e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions? And what kind of margins are you seeing on that cross-sell business?
A – Rob Painter: Well, from a incremental growth out of the cross-selling, I would say we're in very, very early innings of that opportunity for us. What we have done and I think we've probably talked a little bit about this before as we think about it both from a product aspect as well as a go-to-market aspect and of course both of those work backwards from the strategy we have of project delivery in the construction space from a product perspective to give you a little flavor of -- a couple of examples in the quarter of some integrations that we and workflows that we now have between let's say between e-Builder, Viewpoint and the traditional Trimble solutions. For example we released an integration between our estimating product and mechanical electrical plumbing space and the ERP from Viewpoint. And so what that means now is that the ERP can consume the estimate that's been established. And once you've consumed -- the ERP has consumed that estimate, now when you break that down into the project budget and you're breaking down line item codes by -- line item cost by phase code and actually also working all the way through out to the buyout lists, you're able to have a really nice integration between the estimating system and the job costing system. We had a proof of concept as another example released with the telematics equipment we have in the construction site with the back office and that's because the back office is managing again the job costs as well as the cost -- say the cost management can now connect to the utilization of the field equipment in the field. And from a -- a third example of -- and this is really between e-Builder and Viewpoint is an ability for contractors and owners to exchange information seamlessly. And what that's allowing them to do is better connect the supply chains and eliminate the data entry between the two systems. So there's good things happening on the product side. And on the go-to-market site what we had already done a couple of quarters ago was compare the customer list and the customer opportunities. So call that sort of Stage one effort the basics of that comparison. And then from there we put in -- I think it was last quarter cross -- or two quarters ago cross-selling spiffs for the sales teams to cross-sell one another's products. We've seen a few million dollars of activity from that but very early stage. As these product integrations really mature this gives us an opportunity to really put the pedal down more on the go-to-market side. So that's a long answer to your question. The nice organic growth that was produced wasn't on the back of the integration efforts yet and so we see that as opportunity for us to step into -- in let's say a reasonably short timeframe.
Kristen Owen: Okay. I appreciate that. Just switching to transportation and logistics. When we look a year after so the Phase 1 implementation, a lot of the operators that we've talked to that ended up with the ELD devices that didn't really do what they claim to do. So, what kind of opportunity are you seeing there? And then maybe with your existing customer relationships how would you assess your success in capturing some of that upsell business the recurring software business after you sold the hardware?
Steve Berglund: Well, we certainly have seen an element of buyer's remorse in the market and there's definitely some instances where that's created selling opportunities for our business. As you would expect on the heels of the regulation, there was a lot of capital that came into the market and not necessarily what's a good capital developing good solutions for customers. So that in some cases has created buying or let's say new opportunities for us to -- once a customer has had a taste of the technology and what it can do. And if they want to move up more from a compliance-only into more of a spool stack solution to manage the driver to manage a truck and to manage a fleet that's where we will shine as you move up in functionality.  There's clearly still a lot happening in the market. It's a very dynamic market. The second phase of ELD goes into effect in December. And so it does -- I will say it remains a competitive and busy market for sure. Now, if you look at the portfolio we have kind of reiterating the comment that Steve made about the strategic and an operational alignment we have in the Transportation business. Those -- the business we have both in the back office as well as in the field mobility is under one management team right now working towards more integrated offerings of our of the respective technology suites. And so if you think about whether we call it cross-sell or upsell or integrated selling opportunities this puts us in a position to execute on that better than we've -- better opportunity than we've had at any time in the past. So, we feel good about where we sit there between the teams and the opportunity in front of us. And if there's anything else I can give you color on, I'd be happy to do so.
Kristen Owen: Yes. It just -- would it be fair to say that that's where the incremental R&D spend in that segment is going?
Rob Painter: Yes. There's an element of the integrated offering that takes us to really cloud offering to be able to connect supply and demand in the transportation space as well as the ELD work itself certainly still continues to drive some incremental R&D for that business.
Kristen Owen: Okay. Perfect. Will leave it at that. Thank you.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good afternoon. To the extent that you can I'm just trying to understand a little bit better of the issues on OEM and Geospatial. Is that business that's permanently lost? Do OEM switch on other solution so easily? Is it temporality deferred? Is -- I just -- maybe it's competitive, but if you can comment maybe on this something, but I wonder if you could give any characterization of whether that bounces back or it's gone.
Rob Painter: It's more the case of bounce back but there are certainly some cases where we may -- the business may move and that's -- can be the nature of the OEM business and why we favor so much the end-user businesses that we have. I know Rob you wouldn't -- I wouldn't expect you to remember this, but for others on the call, in the old reporting segments that we had, we had a segment called advanced devices and I think selling board level chipsets for example really actually going back to the 40-year history of Trimble. And so we had businesses in that old advanced devices. If we still had that reporting segmentation, it would have looked like some of the businesses in there that we were referencing on the call today. So, the short answer Rob is there's a little bit of both in that comment. Now, what I'd want you to also hear is that when we talk about the OEM businesses the OEM business are associated with our vertical market. So, say OEM business we have in transportation or in agriculture or in construction those businesses -- those OEM businesses all did well and generally in aggregate met the expectations that we had. It was more of the OEM businesses that are really more in a -- more of a component of OEM business where we saw less revenue than expected.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Thanks Rob.
Operator: We have reached the end of our Q&A. Mr. Leyba your closing comments please.
Michael Leyba: Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Michael Leyba, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.
Michael Leyba: Thanks Mark. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. In addition, we will also be posting our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website at investor.trimble.com shortly after the completion of this call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter and the year. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter and the year, and our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. I would also like to briefly mention that during the month of February, we will be attending the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 12 in San Francisco, as well as the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference on February 25 also in San Francisco. With that, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. . In most respects the fourth quarter and total year 2018 results represent record levels in Trimble's 40-year history and provide a strong platform for 2019 and beyond. Fourth quarter revenue grew by 13.1% and total year revenue by 18.2%. The changing company model with growing software and services was reflected in a significant gross margin improvement, which expanded 4.2 points in the quarter and 2.3 points for the year, with the gross margin of 58% for the total year. Together with tight cost control, this improvement drove a remarkable operating leverage at 56% in the quarter and a strong 36% for the total year. As a result, operating margin grew 4.6 points in the quarter and 2.8 points for the total year. On the surface, the quality of our financial model compares favorably to the levels we achieved in 2013 and 2014, before we encountered the negative impact of agricultural and energy commodity price changes. In reality, the portfolio of today represents significantly more balanced, resiliency and growth potential. In particular, we are not – we are much less reliant today on the Resources and Utilities and Geospatial segments. In 2013, the combined revenue of those two segments accounted for 53% of the company total. In 2018, it was 41%. More importantly, during the same period the two segments moved from 65% of total operating income in 2013 to 46%. The portfolio is also demonstrating rapid progress in business model conversion with over 50% of 2018 revenue coming from software and services. This change is reflected in our closing 2018 ARR balance of over $1 billion. Clearly, 2018 was a year in which the stars were well-aligned. Every vertical market generated revenue and margin growth and demonstrated strategic progression. Almost every region produced robust growth and our OEM sales added incremental growth to our core end-user markets. The year was also notable for substantial progress we made in creating that strategic and state in the Buildings & Infrastructure segment with the acquisitions of e-Builder and Viewpoint. These aggressive actions reinforce the unique position around a strong bundle of value in the construction market with an enhanced position in project management, extensive relationships with project owners, and an information backbone that enables real-time access to all the information needed to operate a construction enterprise. We received validation of the strategy in the fourth quarter through our flagship users conference, Dimensions. We had more than 4,800 participants with over 2,000 of them attending our off-site hands-on demonstration area with 60 machines from 28 OEMs. We took the opportunity to demonstrate operational examples of autonomous compactors and dozers as well as numerous examples of practical mixed reality and machine learning. There are some pictures from the conference shown on today's agenda slide as well as a hyperlink that shows the technology in use. Beyond the objective merits of the e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions, I'm gratified by the rapid engagement with, and intense participation in, our efforts to execute unified strategy. Together we continue to discover both strategic and budgetary synergies which create a much augmented ability to establish a unique and enhanced solution for the construction industry. As we noted last quarter, the relatively unique positive environmental alignment in 2018 began to show some cracks as the year came to a close. The fourth quarter provided some key points to watch in 2019 including the impact of trade policy on U.S. farmers, reduced or deferred demand from the U.S. government, the combined effects of Brexit, and slower Chinese growth on European exports and growth, and reduced demand from OEMs. Two additional effects impacting 2019 will be the accounting effects of our accelerating conversion to subscription models and the impact of the stronger dollar. Pending better clarity, we have adopted a generally conservative forecasting stance on these issues for 2019 with potential upside if any of these issues are resolved early. Rob will speak more specifically to each of these points. A point of differentiation between us and many companies that have reported recently is that we are not attributing a change in growth trajectory to the Chinese market. Although Chinese revenue growth was disappointing in 2018, partly as a result of the reaction to U.S. trade policy, other regions have grown much more rapidly than China in the last few years and current Chinese revenues in 2018 represent less than 3% of total revenue, with diminished potential impact on the aggregate result. Resolution on trade tensions will create a net upside for us. We remain committed to the long-term model we described last year with organic growth of 6% to 9% per year over a cycle, plus an additional 3% per year from acquisitions. Our targeted operating leverage can be expected to convert this revenue growth into increasing EBITDA margins. This view on growth is shaped by our central strategic concept of performance to potential, which focuses on the penetration of underserved markets. This moves us beyond simple considerations of GDP or industry growth and leads to the expectation of growth rates larger than standard economic or industry metrics with increased resistance to cyclical downturns. Our strategic focus remains on the end-user not on OEMs, which represented approximately 15% of 2018 revenue. Our OEM strategy is either opportunistic or an element of a more extended go-to-market strategy. We remain bullish on the building and infrastructure segment with some puts and takes regionally. We continue to see the civil engineering end-user market as a double-digit growth worldwide market supported by a generally positive economy and reinforced -- our initiatives and underpenetrated market segments and machine types. We are also marginally more optimistic than we were three months ago that the U.S. Congress could move on in infrastructure bill. The growth outlook for vertical construction also remains attractive, although we are faced with two factors more impactful to that business and other Trimble businesses; one, being unfavorable exchange rates in 2019; and the other being the multiyear revenue accounting effects as we convert more of the business to a subscription model. The Resources and Utilities segment's short-term outlook will be determined to some extent by the duration of the U.S. Chinese trade dispute. U.S. farmers are demonstrating nervousness about the effects of lower Chinese demand for agricultural products and are showing some hesitancy about investing in their operations without more clarity. Longer term, we are confident about the agricultural market potential, driven by worldwide demographics, the potential of variable rate technology and the convergence of hardware and software and to complete workflow solutions. The Transportation segment's short-term outlook is positive, driven in part by the second phase of the ELD mandate. We anticipate longer-term growth as we address the industry's remaining challenges including the improvement of transparency between the shipper and fleet operators. We also have additional growth potential available through worldwide expansion. The Geospatial segment may have more moderate growth prospects than the other segments but, nonetheless, it has meaningful three-year growth potential, driven by the technology replacement cycle, the creation of new classes of product through innovation, alternative business models featuring hardware-as-a-service, and the inclusion of Trimble technology in autonomy solutions. Our view on the regions also remains generally positive. We view our U.S. markets positively through 2019 with the qualification relative to the trade induced ambiguity in agriculture. Europe, although still producing double-digit organic growth is accumulating more questions and our outlook has become somewhat more conservative. Russia remains a country with significant potential, but brings with it some volatility and challenges. Brazil is a significant and attractive market for us currently driven by agriculture, but with new potential in the transportation enabled by our Veltec acquisition, although too soon to tell the Brazilian regime change has potentially improved three-year prospects for construction. India had a very strong 2018, and we expect the country to be a significant contributor to results in the next three years. Africa is a small contributor at this point and is inherently a complex market but with meaningful three-year potential. China is a significant three-year question pending improved clarification of trade policy and rules of engagement. In summary, we are coming out of the most successful Trimble year ever with excellent strategic positioning significant market momentum and an organization focused on performing to our potential. Let me turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Steve. In my commentary, I will review the results for both the fourth quarter and the total year of 2018 before closing with guidance. Starting on slide 5, fourth quarter total revenue was $793 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 13% year-over-year and at the lower end of our guidance range. Breaking that down, currency translation subtracted 1% and acquisitions net of divestitures added 10%. Organic growth was 4%. ARR or annualized recurring revenue grew to $1.05 billion in the quarter, up 36% year-over-year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 59.5%, up 420 basis points year-over-year reflecting favorable pricing dynamics as well as favorable product mix, which was driven both organically and inorganically. Gross margin was clearly a standout dynamic in the quarter. For the year, we delivered a 230 basis points year-over-year improvement in gross margins. The adjusted EBITDA margin which includes income from joint ventures and equity investments was 23.6% in the fourth quarter, up 430 basis points year-over-year. Operating income dollars increased 43% to $172 million with operating margins increasing 460 basis points to 21.7%. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined from 23% to 19% year-over-year driven by U.S. tax reform. Net income was up 31% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.48, up $0.11 or 30% year-over-year. Commensurate with our low capital intensity and attractive cash generation profile of the business deferred revenue was up 40% year-over-year and net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue was approximately 3% on a trailing 12-month basis. Cash flow from operations was $102 million, down 5% year-over-year, which was driven by the timing of a $30 million cash interest payment. Otherwise, cash flow from operations would have been up year-over-year. We closed the quarter at a gross debt level of over $1.9 billion, a net debt of just under $1.8 billion representing about 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, which is more than three quarters ahead of our original deleveraging plan. If a full 12 months of EBITDA from e-Builder and Viewpoint were incorporated, that metric will be lower still. Our balance sheet remains demonstrably strong and provides us with flexibility to simultaneously consider a range of capital allocation actions. We expect to continue to delever and pursue modest year buybacks while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities. During the fourth quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Veltec and we repurchased 1.1 million Trimble shares. Next, put the fourth quarter into context of the overall year as the performance in any singular quarterly is incomplete by definition. Turning to slide 6 when looking at the total year for additional perspective, we view 2018 as a very strong year. Revenue grew 18% overall and 9% organically. Gross margins expanded 230 basis points to 58%. With approximately 36% operating leverage for the year, operating margins expanded 280 basis points to 20.6%. EBITDA margins expanded 240 basis points to 22.6%. And EPS grew $0.49 or 34% to $1.94 exceeding the guidance ranges that were previously provided at our Analyst Day and during our third quarter earnings call. Lastly, our 2018 cash flow from operations was up 13% on a year-over-year basis and near $500 million, driven by the growth in net income and deferred revenue, partially offset by increased working capital. Turning to page 7, the eight listed metrics are financially representative of our identity as a technology company. From revenue mix, growth, contracted backlog and our low capital intensity, our metrics demonstrate the strength of the Trimble financial model. Turning now to slide 8, let's go to the revenue details at the reporting segment level, which is presented on a year-over-year basis. Buildings and Infrastructure delivered 7% organic growth with double-digit growth in the building construction business and the civil construction business down slightly. Our BIM-centric building construction businesses continued growth across the portfolio and across all major regions. In civil construction, the discrete negative impact was from U.S. government sales, which we expect to continue into the first part of 2019. The underlying end-user field sales growth remains strong in the business, reflecting the strength of our distribution network and new product introductions. Geospatial delivered 3% organic revenue growth with end-user demand exceeding this number and OEM-centric business is slightly down. Resources and Utilities was flat on an organic basis. Our OEM base -- business was up based on new OEM partners. Variable rate technology was also up. The end-user business was down and is a story of geography. North and South America were both up, both benefiting from go-to market actions, whereas, Asia Pacific was down driven by the drought in Australia. Our Europe business had a tough comp as well as some discrete issues in Ukraine. Put into context to of the year, the business had a solid year of growth. Finally, the Transportation business produced 4% organic growth with growth in subscription revenues above this level offset by lower a new unit hardware demand that drove the comparable number in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moving next to slide 9, let's give an update on our Viewpoint and e-Builder acquisitions. Steve covered the strategic rationale in his commentary in how these capabilities are enabling us to strengthen our reach to contractors and owners as we link the construction -- constructible model to the project delivery. Both businesses have outperformed expectations since acquisition including strong bookings growth in 2018 that provides us a high degree of visibility into 2019 financials. In the e-Builder business, we moved Trimble's program management solutions under the e-Builder management team to rationalize our product and go-to-market strategies. In the case of Viewpoint, the transition from license to subscription is ahead of plan. The customer-driven strategy of selling an integrated office team and field offering, which is packaged as a Viewpoint 1 is demonstrating that general contractors -- the general contractors value having mobility and project delivery capabilities bundled with their construction management system. Further, we announced the transfer of the MEP business from Viewpoint into the larger Trimble MEP business to help us drive a unified workflow between the job costing, system resident in an ERP solution with the estimating and constructible design capabilities of the Trimble MEP software. Looking at our combined capabilities, we are driving customer success by integrating workflows and we have made tactical progress to motivate joint selling efforts across the businesses. Next, slide 10, for an overview of the geographic revenue mix. Between the relative strength of the U.S. economy and the North American centricity of recent acquisitions, we again see the portfolio mix tilting towards North America in the quarter. The trailing 12-month performance reflects the strength we've also seen out of Europe. In Asia-Pacific, Steve commented earlier on China and I commented on the impact of drought in Australia. India outperformed both in the quarter and for the year. And Rest of World, Brazil was the standout performer. Let's turn to slide 11 and look at our trailing 12-month revenue mix by type. We grew to a level of 52% or $1.6 billion of software services and recurring revenue and 48% hardware. This is a significant milestone for Trimble as this is the first year we have crossed the 50% threshold. Within the software revenue elements recurring revenue which is mainly comprised of subscription revenue and support and maintenance agreements stands at $935 million, or 30% of total revenue. Software and services which is mainly comprised of perpetual and term licenses as well as professional services represents $680 million of revenue. Each software-oriented revenue type grew double-digit with hardware growing high-single-digit reflecting strength across the entire business in addition to acquisitions. Moving on to slide 12, let's go through the operating income details at a reporting segment level. Operating income growth drivers were similar across each of the reporting segments with gross margins expanded based on product mix and pricing. When combined with operating expense management this enabled us to significantly expand our operating margins in every reporting segment and over 460 basis points at the company level as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. I will now close with guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures. Overall, we believe the company is positioned for solid growth in 2019 following a very strong 2018, with a continued shift towards software and subscription revenues and margin expansion ahead of the target model we set out at Investor Day. The margin expansion we are seeing reflects the resiliency of our model and the actions we have taken over the last few years to balance our market exposure, exit non-core activities, shift our business toward software and to control our operating expenses. Turning to page 13, for the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue of $795 million to $820 million, an EPS of $0.44 to $0.48 per share. The first quarter revenue range assumes total company growth of 7% to 10% with organic growth in the 3% to 5% range plus a 6% to 7% from acquisitions less 2% from FX due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The earnings per share range also incorporates an updated 20% non-GAAP tax rate reflecting our expectation on geographic profitability mix. To bridge this revenue range against our long-term model as Steve discussed. Our strategic focus as a company is centered around end users, where we believe the growth drivers are secular in nature. Throughout 2018, the growth of our end-user businesses fit the target model and we expect this demand pattern to continue into 2019. In the first quarter, three discrete elements moderating total company revenue growth expectations include: one government orders and our OEM-centric businesses; two agricultural weakness in some markets which we largely attribute to trade and tariff consideration; and three the acceleration toward subscription revenue, primarily in our construction business and secondarily in our Transportation business. In fact, our SketchUp business is officially launched their subscription model today. This revenue conversion is definitively the right thing to do for the business and we believe will further fuel our ARR growth. With the first quarter as context, our current full year view of 2019 total company growth is estimated at 6% to 10% with organic growth in the 4% to 7% range, plus 3% to 4% growth from recent acquisitions less 1% from FX impact. Please note that in the second half of 2019 that Viewpoint flips to the organic category and positively moves the needle on a total company organic growth. With the incremental uncertainty, as we mentioned, our view is that the prudent course of action is to remain cautious here at the beginning of the year and continually assess patterns as we progress through the year. We expect gross margins overall to be slightly up on a year-over-year basis and we expect to manage operating expenses to deliver 25% to 30% operating leverage. We expect a strong year from a cash flow perspective with cash flow from operations above non-GAAP net income and reduce working capital. We currently anticipate about half of our cash flow will be directed towards debt paydown, which will keep us well ahead of our deleveraging plan. On that basis, we expect interest expense to decrease as we progress through the year, with overall interest expense in the range of $80 million. Equity income is expected to grow to approximately $35 million. Under those assumptions and using a 20% non-GAAP tax rate for the year, we expect EPS growth in the high single digits for the full year, delivering single-digit growth in the first half of the year and double-digit growth in the back half of the year. Where if not for the subscription conversion, operating leverage and EPS growth would be higher. Let me close, as Steve began, 2018 represented a record year of performance for Trimble and provided a strong platform for 2019 and beyond. Let's now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Gal Munda: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. The first one I have is just in terms of the business model transition. Rob, you mentioned that it's definitely having an impact on organic growth for next year. Can you give us – have you thought about maybe trying to quantify how much of that would be the impact on organic growth when you kind of look at the guidance for the year? And then as a follow up, I just have one question on the incremental income margin.
Rob Painter: Sure. Hi, Gal. I'd call it a plus or minus range. If we look at about, call it, $30 million of revenue converting to subscription and I call it an incremental $30 million of revenue converting to subscription in 2019. At a total company growth or an organic growth view that has 1 point impact on the top line. Of course, that $30 million also goes directly to the bottom line. And so what you would see from an operating leverage perspective is, call it, 5 to 8 points of a drag on operating leverage and therefore, an impact on EPS as well.
Gal Munda: That’s really helpful. Thank you. And then, the second thing is, you've basically highlighted the fact that the first quarter when software and services have overtaken the hardware portion of the business. You obviously have a plan to reach kind of 55% by FY 2021. If the current environment continues, is it fair to say that that percentage could potentially be higher? And where I'm getting at with the question is, what is your exposure -- rather the revenue exposure, what is your exposure to margin in terms of the software versus the hardware business, if you have thought about that way, which means that if hardware doesn't grow as fast, how much will be your margin can you expand effectively?
Rob Painter: So as we look at the model forward, I think, yes, if you would take the pattern of today and if we assume that that would hold, I would, by, let's say, the laws of math expect the software to be higher than 55% at that point. And aside from that, I think, we're already probably on track to be a bit ahead of that. It would be a modest difference, not a fundamental difference, given the underlying size of the dollar revenue base. From a margin perspective and what would happen with margins on -- I'd say hardware versus software growth in the next years, it actually doesn't make a very big difference to the margins. So the hardware business as an aggregate have a solid level of profitability today. So there's not let's say a distinct shift that would happen if the revenue mix were to change.
Gal Munda: Okay. Thank you. Great help.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ann Duignan: Yes, hi. Maybe you could give us a little bit more color on the government slowdown in orders? I think you mentioned that in both the Buildings and Infrastructure or the civil side, but also on the Geospatial side. So if you could just provide more color that will be great?
Rob Painter: Hi Ann. So we've seen it in a couple of areas and as you said in geospatial and civil construction. The dynamic has more or less been as follows; we've had some orders that have pushed out, and then we've had some orders that just didn't come. Of course it doesn't help that government was shut down, but this was actually prior to that. One of the dynamics we've seen and I think, I probably underestimated it was -- actually the lack of appointments we have in some of the government positions. And so as those positions have been slow to get appointed, what we often have is the new person comes in and wants to review programs and that slowed the machinery down, so to speak. So it's not at all about competitive issues at all. It's really just to say that the straight demand from the government business.
Ann Duignan: And is it any department in particular? Or any appointments we're waiting for? Or the department just been mean and we’re just waiting for projects to get back on the table?
Rob Painter: It's really not any department in particular. I'd say it's a little bit across-the-board. We have both business in the civil side of the government as well as some of -- to the Department of Defense and some of the military branches, a little bit more on the DoD side than in the civilian space. We've -- I'd say generally yes, we think by the second half of the year we'll be where we need to be. Of course, it's the third quarter. Our third quarter is the big quarter for government sales as you get closer to the end of the budgetary year. It's the end of the government's fiscal year. And so that's kind of the -- from an annual perspective that's the make or break quarter. And we -- at this point we would be positive on that business in the second half of the year.
Ann Duignan: Okay. And if I could I'd like to ask a follow up on the transportation side. You've been reading a lot how competitive the industry there is for Telematics and for -- just offering the fleet beyond Telematics and beyond the ELDs. As we transition away from ELDs what's your view of how competitive that industry is and how competitive might get going forward? And what are the ramifications for your business either at the margin side or the revenue side?
Rob Painter: Yes, it's a good question Ann. There's no doubt that the ELD mandate which is really a compliance activity brought a lot of competition into the market, particularly, at the low end of the market if it's just to check the box compliance activity or for the very small fleets. As we look at -- if you can contrast that to the Trimble business, there's no doubt we also had some benefit from the ELD business, but we're fundamentally about providing an enterprise solution. And so as we think about the space as it is today, there's a lot more trucking companies that now have adopted technology as a result of the mandate. What we believe is starting to happen and will continue to happen is that a number of trucking companies are going to have buyers' remorse from the solutions that they bought that have no ability to have an upgrade path to an enterprise solution and get beyond the check the box compliance activity. So, in that respect, we would be -- we actually see that as a favorable that so much more of the market has adopted some technology that actually won't be able to meet the needs such that as we can. From the enterprise side of the space of trucking -- of the trucking market, I would agree that that also is -- has become more competitive. And then in that space when we look at what's uniquely different about Trimble and this is a very -- this is North American context as we're the only company that can bring together both the enterprise, back office, with the mobility solutions and the field with the mapping technologies as well as actually now shipper visibility. So, our ability to connect ecosystem we think is unique and differentiable in the North American context. And then the last thing, I guess, I would add is with the acquisition of Veltec that gets us an extension into Brazil which is the largest market south of the U.S. and we also have business today in India as well as in Western Europe.
Ann Duignan: Okay, I'll leave it there and get back in queue. I appreciate the color, helpful.
Rob Painter: Thanks Ann.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Steve, can we just -- would it be possible or Rob just to maybe parse out if you think about where the revenue guide was for the fourth quarter. It seems like from plan, we're really talking about the B&I civil business and then also the Resource & Utility Ag business. Could you just kind of parse out, I mean, $10 million of plan in those two pieces of the business? Or can you get us focused there a little bit as to how those businesses and then the cadence through the quarter? It sounds like the civil side being government-oriented, you probably have a good sense of that as early as October, but I'm curious about the cadence through the quarter in those two pieces of the business that maybe were off the plan.
Rob Painter: Sure. So, yes, relative to the -- I'd say the original guide or original thoughts we had for the quarter, it was concentrated in the Resources & Utilities and the Buildings & Infrastructure market. In aggregate, the government and the OEM sales were lower in those -- within the collective businesses. Actually I guess geospatial would have been lower as well in the OEM business, so geospatial a bit lower in the OEM revenue. The civil construction was in the government revenue primarily, because when we look at the underlying field sales growth which is the vast majority of the business, our field sales were up double-digit organically in the quarter, so exceeded actually the expectations we had over the field business, which is the end-user business. And in the Resources and Utilities business, predominantly on the agriculture hardware side, I mentioned, Europe, where we didn't run a promotion program that we had the prior year and we saw our delta revenue to that. And then we also saw stocking orders that were lower in the Asia-Pacific region both of which we've seen now reversed as we've come into Q1.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And against the 4% to 7% core for the year, maybe expectation, how do the four segments kind of lineup here? It sounds like towards the higher end would be trans and maybe the vertical construction? Could you just kind of put those on a relative basis here to the 4% to 7%?
Rob Painter: Yes, sure. So, from record, there's the 4% to 7% that we've talked about for the year. I could also probably index that against what we've talked about it at Investor Day for the reporting segments. Now if we take the transportation business and the Buildings and Infrastructure those two would be, I'd say, right in line with what we talked about it at Investor Day with B&I at an 8% to 10%, expectation transportation at 7% to 9%. Geospatial has dialed down a bit and that's from the OEM parts of the Geospatial business. And then the Resources and Utilities business that's also dialed down and we've tempered expectation a bit here, especially relative to the tariffs and trade. And I mean, as Steve mentioned, certainly that if these things get resolved, that's a net positive for us.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just probably last question from me. For Steve, I'm just curious, we narrowed down the list of many small wounds or negatives out there to kind of just list the 4. And I think can you just kind of look at this list of 4, the trade policy, the reduced demand by U.S. government, Brexit and the OEMs reduced demand? And just kind of give order of magnitude as to the impact on the business if one or all of these start to clear?
Steve Berglund: Well, okay. Probably, I think top of mind would be the trade as it's, I guess, indirectly affecting U.S. farmers. I think the demand from China is very much reduced maybe putting it mildly, it has introduced major ambiguity into the U.S. farm environment. And there are -- and the farmers are actually facing windows where they have to make decisions in terms of what to plant this season. So I think that probably in terms of effect in 2019, maybe the indirect effects of trade on U.S. farmers maybe is top of mind. Now at the same time as in the Chinese market, it's clear kind of U.S. actions or the interchange between the U.S. and China is giving relative license for, let's call it, renewed economic nationalism in China. So I think there's a secondary impact here, which again we're not putting kind of top of mind here. But I would say U.S. agriculture is maybe the most direct and obvious effect on us. I think – okay. Brexit and kind of the second and third order effects Europe is kind of in the category of who knows – first off, who knows what's really going to happen and then who knows what the effects of whatever that maybe. I mean, there's certainly an impact on the U.K. and there would be knock on effects in Europe. And I think our view is that, it can be pretty significant and it all remains to be seen. So I think that is more in the still a – to be kind of to be determined, unknowable but I think we share that ambiguity with a lot of other companies as well. I think the reduced deferred demand from the U.S. government, I think is a short-term issue. I'm not sure that has even full year effects on 2019. It may be kind of a first half versus second half effect. But I think that is maybe more of a short-term kind of tactical. And the reduced demand from the OEMs, I think maybe reflects again just caution and a drawback from some collection of uncertainties as it related to the latter part of 2018 and 2019. But I would say, yes, substantially the impact of trade on U.S. agriculture and the possibilities of Brexit fallout or probably the two that really matter to us. The others tend to be not really nearly so strategic or necessarily structural as those two.
Q – Richard Eastman: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to see, if you could give us a little bit more color on the impact from China? And to what degree there are offsets for the U.S. demand? Do you have products that are subject to tariffs? Just wanted to get a little bit more of a sense of what's driving that?
Rob Painter: Yeah. So first of all, just to clarify, we're not pointing necessarily at tariff effects as the primary kind of issue in China. I think it's the relative license that's maybe growing around the world for kind of a higher degree of economic nationalism kind of enabled by talk of tariffs and protection of industries. So I think there's always been implicit in China a level of economic nationalism, our preference for national champions and such. So I think there is – okay. It's more of that element in terms of kind of a bias shown in the Japanese – sorry Chinese market than necessarily a direct effect of kind of tariff outcomes. I think also that clearly the Chinese market has slowed with kind of primary effects and secondary effects so some of the demand in China has just slowed because the market has slowed. But I think there's also if you will a more defined more apparent bias towards, let's call it national champions of one sort or another, even if they've got an inferior product. So I think again, we've been dealing in this environment for some period of time. It's intensified clearly in the last 12 to 18 months, but I think that's the issue in China more so than just straight calculation of tariff effects or anything like that.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And Rob, how should we be thinking about maybe ARR growth for 2019?
Rob Painter: Yes. So we had the 36% growth year-over-year in 2018. Of course, some of that was aided by the acquisitions we grew in the teens and mid-teens in 2018. As we look into 2019 I expect that pattern as well to be somewhere in the low-teens growth in ARR which is obviously a significant element for us now.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Good afternoon and good evening. I wonder if we could start in Resources and Utilities where you -- Steve you had mentioned farmers feeling the impact of the tariff situation. Sorry, are you saying that in the first quarter we're going to see OEM production cuts? Or are you seeing meaningful year-over-year declines in North America aftermarket inflations? Can you just flesh that out for us, and we're talking about a number of headwinds yet pretty reasonable organic growth in the first quarter, so I just wanted to make sure I understand as your messaging if there's risk to the downside? Or is your point organic growth would have been better without the headwinds that spoke about it at length over the course of this call?
Rob Painter: Well, I guess, by definition -- this is Rob. I guess, by definition, the organic growth would have been better were it not for the headwinds we saw. As we look into Q1 I mean, into 2019 we read the same stuff as you do about OEM expectations on new machine units which you of course have to parse into what's in the dealer inventory versus what's retail demand. The majority of our business of course is aftermarket business and not OEM-centric although of course that is still important to us in the agriculture business. We also look at the business that's outside of North America. Years ago, we used to be the majority in North American business in agriculture. And today, that's I think less than 30% of revenue is coming from North America in agriculture. So the factors all add up. So for instance, if you look at the pressure on U.S. farmers related to tariffs and the Chinese demand on soy. Of course, the Chinese are now buying that soy from Brazil. And so right our mantra then is to go get the business in Brazil and that is one of the reasons we've seen that Brazil business growing nicely here for the last few years. Actually we see -- we've talked about -- we sometimes might see in North America, but actually we need to isolate that to U.S. because we've seen the business in Canada performing well. The other element as we come in and think about ag here at the beginning of the year and for the total year is we look at our new product introduction cycles that we expect to come out throughout the year. We look at our own go-to-market initiatives that we would view ourselves is having control of more enterprise selling, more bundling of our hardware and software, additional OEM relationships and always looking to improve the distribution partners that we have. And so we take those factors together and that gets to our point of view on agriculture and why we do things that there's good business to be had there.
Jerry Revich: And Rob, just a clarification, are you expecting your aftermarket inflations in the U.S. to be down year-over-year in the first quarter? Or are you just talking about a slowdown in the pace of growth?
Rob Painter: I'd say it's more kind of flat, which would be a slowdown in the pace of growth.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And e-Builder bookings growth really accelerated to what looks like about 50% growth in the fourth quarter, if I am understanding the disclosures right. I'm wondering if you can expand on what's driving the momentum and how sustainable is that through the early part of 2019, as the comps seem to suggest?
Rob Painter: Well, I can say without reservation that business is an excellent business run by an excellent set of operators. I mean, we're very pleased with the performance of the business thus far under Trimble. I think we believe that e-Builder, let's say from a product perspective has a unique solution. It's meeting an unmet need in the market without a great deal of competition. The team has I'd say a very well oiled machine relative to the go-to market. Actually they execute the sales and marketing aspect of the engine, and so we're bullish on the business. And we feel bullish on the continued growth in bookings as well as profitability of the business. And we're bullish on the intersection points between e-Builder and the rest of Trimble construction both vertical and horizontal construction. We made our first integration for our customer between e-Builder and Viewpoint between the program management system and the project management system that the general contractor is using. And so we believe there's many more things to come along that line. And then also I would add that in -- let's see -- and noting the performance of that team in our business we moved a couple of product lines that we had I'd say in Trimble over to the e-Builder management team to run. And we're optimistic that that business will flourish under their leadership.
Jerry Revich: I appreciate the discussion. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Okay.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about the paydown on the debt versus buying back stock? How do you guys think about that? And what should we expect in the first half this year?
Rob Painter: Yeah. Hi, Colin. So for the year, we expect to pay down approximately $75 million a quarter of the debt, so call that $150 million for the first half of the year. If we look back the stock buyback, we did in Q4 the $40 million and I'll call that a plus or minus as a baseline expectation here in the first half of the year. That assumes if there was acquisitions, that they will be tuck-in in nature. If there was anything of more material size, we'd immediately revert back to the focus on the deleveraging. But there's nothing to let's say report on that side.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then, obviously, there's an awful lot of variables to track with the business given the diversity of end markets. I mean, as you think about the second half growth and earnings power, what are the -- a couple of key levers that you guys are really concerned about right now as you think could break either way that we should be tracking?
Rob Painter: Well, if there was something to be concerned about I would highlight, Steve's commentary and the thing that gives us some degree of caution or the things that we're paying attention to would be the geopolitical topics around trade or things like Brexit or general macros and how that impacts OEM businesses and new unit sales to a degree that that impacts Trimble. But from a positive standpoint, a lot of the things that encourage folks to think about is with the over $1 billion of ARR coming in to the year that is a very meaningful amount of revenue that we have line of sight to. And that ARR grows throughout the year as we grow the cumulative subscriber bases in our businesses. A couple of other details I would add as we think about from, so I'll call it a positive sense as we move into the second half of the year. Truth is as we get a little bit more of a favorable comp in the second half of the year than we would have in the first half of the year at least on an organic basis. The other thing -- another thing to look at is that our software -- as we get more software-centric we see Q4 as the I'd say the biggest quarter in many of the software businesses and as that -- and with that expectation that that plays through this year because it has -- it basically continues what we've been doing so if that continues to play through that gives us conviction that we've got a handle on the business in the second half of the year. And then I would layer in the so-called usual activities of new product introductions that we anticipate in a variety of businesses and that would add up to the conviction we have for the business as we move throughout the year.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Rich Valera: Thank you. Rob could you bridge between the -- your prior organic growth guidance for the year which I think was 6% to 9% and the 4% to 7% now, does that reduction -- is any of that from subscription transition or is that all from kind of four main factors you discussed previously?
Rob Painter: Yes. I will add context, the 6% to 9% we talked about over the economic cycle. And we've always had a point of view that in any given year it could be higher or -- slightly higher or slightly lower but I do appreciate that you heard as 2019 6% to 9%, but what we talked about last quarter, 6 -- reaffirming 6% to 9% over cycle and Steve reaffirmed that at the beginning of the commentary. So, the better bridge I think I can make is okay if it's 6% to 9% over a cycle why would we have a view that would be slightly dialed down on that for 2019 as a year. And the first one I will talk about would be the government sales and the OEM revenue streams. So, I'll focus on two, is if I can take that as one category. The line of sight we have in those two revenue streams, we expect that to be lighter this year overall than it was last year and I could look at the second half of last year as -- call it the baseline view of that and playing that forward into 2019 over a total year basis. We take about -- I'll call it about one point of growth. And then the other one I'd say to focus on would be -- I think it's what you're getting at would be the subscription revenue transition. And using the SketchUp business which did officially launch the subscription model today that transition goes as we expect it to go that -- if we see that conversion of revenue, which of course, would be call it a third less than what we might normally see, then that's going to have a natural headwind to the revenue growth. But of course, for everyone doing the math on the model it's definitively a good thing if not a great thing for the underlying health of Trimble as we grow that ARR revenue stream.
Rich Valera: That's perfect. Thank you. And then I just wanted to clarify. I think what you said, when you're talking about your growth of ARR in response to a prior question was that last year the organic growth rate was mid-teens. Is that the correct number to think of for the organic ARR growth last year?
Rob Painter: Yes correct.
Rich Valera: Got it. And just one final one, if I could gross margin as you know was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter. How should we think of 2019 as a whole relative to the – for gross margin relative to that fourth quarter level?
Rob Painter: Yeah, it's a good question. So on – in the fourth quarter, we think on an ongoing basis we're going to see what we saw in Q4 2018 which is that the strongest performing gross margin quarter in a given year which is a function of the amount of software that we see selling in a quarter. So, basically in other words, it's a product mix topic relative to end of year sales – end of the year revenue dynamics and the software businesses is that we have that we'll just essentially by the math and the mix will pop gross margins by I'll call it 100 to 200 basis points in Q4. So which is a way of saying then that taking Q4 as the baseline is not assuming – is not the baseline to take for us for the total year of 2018. Now for the total year, 2018 we ended at 58% gross margin. And we would see just a really would plan for just a slight increase to that as we come into 2019 as a total year. Now how the revenue mix plays out through the year of course could take that higher, if it was more software-centric than we expected or lower if the hardware business is stronger than we expected.
Rich Valera: That's perfect. Thanks for taking my question, Rob. Appreciate it.
Rob Painter: No problem.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi. So just two points of clarification, if I may. Is there a incremental slowdown from the actual government slowdown? Or is that not a material factor? And then in resources maybe 3Q is abnormally stronger or is quite strong anyway. Was this really all – if I understand it right a majority led aftermarket slowdown in North America? Or were the tariffs continue to be an issue? Or was it really more balanced than that?
Rob Painter: Well, let me start with the first question on that – I think you said Rob that the government shut down and to what extent.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes, the actual shutdown is that incremental yes.
Rob Painter: I think slight. It's certainly a delay. I wouldn't say that, because of government shutdown that the orders went away, but it's actually one area where we think that played out – it plays out in agriculture market as – when the USDA was shut down. That's that much less time that the USDA was – USDA spent with farmers and we're getting close to planting season here before too long, but not overall really not material in and of itself. Can you repeat the second one? I didn't hear the beginning of the question.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes. I'm sorry it's just on resources. 3Q was pretty good to be fair and then slowdown. The tariffs were in place in 3Q and we didn't see the farmers sort of panicking. And so I'm just really curious as to whether that was really a North American slowdown? Or there's a little bit of everywhere? Or really what led such an abrupt slowdown from 3Q to 4Q?
Rob Painter: Yes. So the two biggest areas for us were in Europe and in Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific two aspects, one is the drought in Australia, which that – as I understand it, there's drought conditions are – I don’t know if I could say over, but they are relieving in Australia. And we see some of the demand coming back. The second in the Asia-Pacific region was stocking orders from our dealers that didn't come at the end of 2000 -- that didn't come in Q4 like they have in prior years. And we saw some of the partners taking actions to manage inventories down at the end of the year. And we saw those orders come back immediately in January. So that was one aspect that would connect the dots between the Q3 and the Q4 pattern. In Europe, two things that we saw, I guess you could call them discrete. One would be, we normally run a promotion in Q4 in Europe that we didn't run this year in Q4. We started running it here at the beginning of Q1 and it had the impact that we would have otherwise expected on the business. And so there's a delta of revenue there. And then the second one is, there's been some issues in Ukraine around VAT that we're holding up business there, between Russia, Ukraine and the CIS countries, that's become a bigger market for us. So those would be the factors, I would call out in Resources and Utilities that change the slope of that curve from Q3 into Q4.
Rob Wertheimer: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Michael Leyba for closing remarks.
Michael Leyba: Thank you everyone for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Michael Leyba, you may begin your conference.
Michael Leyba - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I'd like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. In addition, we will also be posting our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website at investor.trimble.com shortly after the completion of this call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. I would also like to briefly mention that we will be attending the Baird 2018 Global Industrial Conference on November 7 in Chicago. With that, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Good afternoon. The third quarter was largely consistent with prior quarters. We delivered double-digit organic growth and 32% operating leverage that resulted in EBITDA of 23% and year-to-year EPS growth of 26%. The strength was seen across all segments in most regions. During the quarter we launched a period of very active and positive engagement with our markets. In September, October and November, we have conducted or will conduct five users conferences. SketchUp's conference 3D Basecamp was held in September with more than 1,200 attendees. The focus was on 3D modeling innovations and workflows for architects, designers and makers. Transportation's conference in.sight was also held in September with more than 2,100 fleet operators, shippers and logistics providers. The key theme of the conference was the unique and comprehensive solution available from combined PeopleNet and TMW capabilities. The event also marked the full transition to the unified Trimble brand. e-Builder's user conference Elevate was held in October with over 500 participants. The user community was primarily private and public project owners. Beyond the traditional conference emphasis on the introduction of greater product functionality, the focus was on the potential of e-Builder and Trimble combination and the breakout of benefits for the user, which will become available over time. Viewpoint's users conference Collaborate was also held in October with over 2,200 attendees, most of them contractors. The focus was on the full rollout of the office team, field, information architecture. The additional theme at the conference was also on the potential the Viewpoint-Trimble combination and the path to fully integrated information. Including, for example, the real-time integration of machine performance into the enterprise system. Trimble's flagship users conference Dimensions will be held next week in Las Vegas with more than 4,000 participants. The majority of the audience will consist of contractors, engineers and geospatial professionals. Dimensions has become a central feature in Trimble's go-to-market identity and has become a construction industry fixture. The primary emphasis will be on education and the transfer of knowledge from user to user. We will also release several new products and demonstrate emerging new technology capabilities such as autonomy, augmented reality and vision tracking. We are finding these close engagements with the market to be highly validating in three respects. The first is increasing belief in technology as a transformative force, the number of true believers is growing. The second is growing understanding that tighter integration of information solutions enhances the possibility of breakout results. The third is a belief that Trimble is a unique force in assembling and integrating workflow solutions. In particular, we are receiving reinforcement that we are on the right path and are focused on integrating the physical and digital worlds. The Viewpoint and e-Builder conferences also provided visible evidence of early success from the collaboration among Trimble, Viewpoint and e-Builder. Both acquired businesses are on track with the deal financial models and the level of synergistic innovation is exceeding expectations. The overall picture is very encouraging. We are anticipating closing the year with fourth quarter revenue performance consistent with the strategic growth model we identified at our Investors Day and year-to-year improvement in the financial model. Total year performance will end well above our strategic profile. We also enter 2019 with arguably the most robust portfolio in Trimble's history. The contribution from each of the vertical market components is well-balanced. We have regional platforms in place that will allow us to provide international market leadership and our mix of software and hardware is steadily shifting to software, which will enable us to maintain our position as the premier provider of value in our markets. We have recently announced two strategic moves that will incrementally improve our portfolio. Brazil, although currently a country in some turmoil, is an important market for us, both in the present and future. We have experienced significant Brazilian growth year-to-date on the strength of agricultural sales. We have now enhanced our Brazilian position in transportation with the recent acquisition of Veltec, a well-established provider of fleet and monitoring services to the Brazilian transportation market. Although the acquisition was of modest size, it provides us with a strong platform to establish an expanded presence in the general trucking market. We also see it as potentially reinforcing our existing positions in agriculture and plantation forestry. Those markets are unique in a number of different ways, and one of their limiting constraints tends to be transportation logistics. With the new capability provided by Veltec, we hope to augment our precision farming and logistics capabilities and provide a more holistic response to the challenges faced by Brazilian farmers and foresters. The other strategic move announced this morning is a strategic collaboration between HCSS and Trimble. HCSS has been a very well-respected provider of construction management software to the heavy civil market for the three decades. Its market presence has been centered on its core capabilities in bidding and estimating. The focus of the intercompany collaboration will be on selected integration of the two companies' software offerings to promote a tighter and more seamless workflow for the contractor. In addition, we anticipate Trimble will become the primary distribution arm for HCSS outside North America. This addition to the already robust construction information architecture evolving under Trimble and Viewpoint will provide compelling value to the contractor and incrementally bolster Trimble's leadership position in the heavy civil market. Although generalized concerns about the macro economy are being expressed in the media, we are not experiencing market conditions that cause us to question our optimism for 2019. That said, we are seeing a number of what might be called micro effects. In isolation, they do not rate much attention, but in aggregate they had a marginal effect on the third quarter and will have some impact on the fourth. They can be broadly categorized as discrete, geopolitical and trade. The discrete impacts include lower September year-end spending by the U.S. government than we have traditionally seen; severe droughts in Australia and Eastern Europe, which have impacted regional agriculture sales; and the Northern California fire, which disrupted our operations in Redding. The geopolitical effects include foreign exchange volatility, which has created headwinds in some countries, such as Turkey, Russia, and Brazil; current and potential new Russian sanctions, which have not yet had a direct effect on us, but tend to intensify a background negativism towards U.S. products; and Brexit-induced uncertainties and resulting negative UK investment sentiment. The direct financial impact resulting from the application of U.S. tariffs remains a peripheral issue for us, at least for the moment. We are more concerned about the potential longer-term secondary effects, as other countries respond to U.S. tariffs, either directly or indirectly. For us, the clearest example of a potential impactful response has been the Chinese restriction on U.S. agricultural exports. The resulting uncertainty on farm incomes may impact U.S. farmers' willingness to invest. We can at least partially arbitrage any impact in the U.S. by intensifying our engagement with markets such as Brazil, which are eager to replace U.S. sources of supply to China and require precision farming solutions to step up production. At a more general level, we are concerned that aggressive U.S. actions will provide justification for greater economic nationalism around the world, which could take multiple forms, including increased explicit favoritism for preferred national industry champions. The improving operational performance over the last several years has enabled us to intensify our emphasis on long-term strategic outcomes. I have previously described our internal 3-4-3 net – framework that places strategic outcomes on an equal footing with quarterly results. The beginning point in that process is to create a non-bounded three-year concept that represents breakout performance and then to reverse engineer the execution back to present day. Our objective is to perform to potential, with potential being represented by the penetration available in our markets. The objective is to surpass the incrementalism of more conventional budgetary processes. Before turning the call over to Rob, let me point out that 2018 represents Trimble's 40th anniversary. The company was founded in 1978 by Charlie Trimble, who was CEO until 1998. Charlie established the strong tradition of innovation we still leverage today. I followed Charlie in 1999, and the two of us represent the entire CEO leadership over the 40-year history, which makes us quite unique among publicly-traded companies and has enabled both strategic consistency and deep market relationships. The earliest experiments on GPS-based construction machine control began late in Charlie's tenure. That technology has evolved and has transformed site preparation and road construction. Recently, we opened a new indoor test facility in Dayton, Ohio, which is a dome supported by air pressure, in which we can develop and test machine control systems using multiple large machines simultaneously. An image is included on page 7. This building represents our ongoing commitment to innovation as well as our willingness to step up and apply the scale and scope necessary to compete successfully in today's market. Rob?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Let's start with the punch line. Our third quarter performance was strong with total revenue growth of 19% and organic revenue growth of over 10%. This represents our fifth quarter in a row of double-digit organic revenue growth. In addition, we outperformed at the operating income and EBITDA margin levels. And we exceeded our third quarter's earnings per share guidance, delivering $0.49 earnings per share. Our operating cash flow was strong. And we continue to hold a favorable strategic position in the marketplace. Let's now turn to a detailed review of the results, starting on slide 8. Third quarter total revenue was $805 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 19% year-over-year. Breaking that down, currency translation subtracted less than 1% and acquisitions added 9%. Organic growth was over 10%. As previewed on our last call, as of the third quarter, we are now reporting a non-GAAP revenue measurement that excludes the effects of deferred revenue write-downs associated with acquisition accounting. Note that prior periods have also been restated to reflect this non-GAAP measure and that historical information is available on our Investor Relations website. Gross margin in the third quarter was 57.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, reflecting favorable pricing dynamics as well as favorable product mix, which was driven both organically and inorganically. The adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was 23% in the third quarter, up 180 basis points year-over-year. Operating income dollars increased 32% to $167 million with operating margins increasing 210 basis points to 20.8%. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined from 23% to 19% year-over-year, reflecting U.S. tax reform. Our net income was up 23%. And non-GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.49, up $0.10 or 26% year-over-year. Reflecting our low capital intensity and attractive cash generation profile of the business, deferred revenue was up 28% year-over-year. And net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue was 3% of our trailing 12-month revenue. Cash flow from operations was $117 million and was up 69% year-over-year, driven by growth in net income, favorable working capital dynamics, and the growth in deferred revenue balances. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was up 19% on a year-over-year basis. To cover our capital structure, we closed the quarter at a gross debt level of just over $2 billion and net debt of just over $1.8 billion, representing 2.75 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, which is ahead of plan and favorable relative to what we have previously communicated. That leverage ratio of 2.7 times incorporates approximately eight months of financial results from e-Builder and three months of results from Viewpoint. If a full 12 months of results from e-Builder and Viewpoint were incorporated, that metric would be lower still. Our balance sheet is demonstrably strong. Turning now to slide 9. Let's go through the revenue details at the reporting segment level, which are presented on a year-over-year basis. Organic revenue is up in each segment. Buildings and Infrastructure delivered 7% organic growth with continued growth in both civil construction and buildings. With acquisitions, the segment was up 36%. Geospatial delivered 10% organic growth, driven by discrete end market applications. Resources and Utilities was up 14% organically with North America and Europe regions leading the way to both aftermarket and OEM customers. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2017 was Müller's first quarter under Trimble and created a favorable comp for this quarter. Finally, the Transportation segment was up 11% organically, driven by subscription revenue growth. This slide also presents a one- and three-year growth trend for the segments, which fits the profile of the model we articulated at Investor Day back in May. To put up a finer point on the revenue mix we had in the quarter, we saw relative strength in a couple of areas. First, the Transportation segment performed exceptionally well in the quarter and came in ahead of expectations. Second, both the e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions performed well in the quarter, especially when looking at the underlying growth in bookings and mix towards subscription revenue over perpetual license revenue. Steve hit on the negative micro impacts we experienced in his commentary. Slide 10 provides an overview of the geographic revenue mix. Between the relative strength of the U.S. economy, the strong quarter in Transportation and the North American centricity of recent acquisitions, we see the portfolio mix tilting towards North America in the quarter. The trailing 12-month performance reflects the strength we've also seen out of Europe. Let me reiterate commentary from last quarter, where we highlighted that China represents less than 5% of company revenue. And separate, but related to trade issues, I'd also like to note that China represents a small portion of our country of origin cost of goods sold. So while tariffs and trade barriers to trade are a headwind to growth, we do feel the current situation is well within our ability to manage. Let's turn to slide 11 and look at our revenue mix by type. For the quarter, software, services and recurring revenue reached a record level of 53% of total revenue. The slide presents the data on a trailing 12-month basis with 50% or $1.5 billion of software, services and recurring revenue and 50% hardware. Within the software revenue elements, recurring revenue, which is mainly comprised of subscription revenue and support and maintenance agreements, is now $865 million on a trailing 12-month basis or 28% of total revenue. Software and services, which is mainly comprised of perpetual and licenses as well as professional services, represents $630 million of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Each revenue type grew double digit, reflecting strength across the entire business. Let's now move to slide 12 and go through the operating income details at a reporting segment level. At a company level, operating income was 20.8% with operating leverage of 32%. Drivers of operating income growth were similar across each of the reporting segments where gross margins expanded based on product mix and pricing. When combined with operating expense management, this enabled us to significantly expand our operating margins over 200 basis points over the third quarter of last year. Turning now to page 13, the 8 listed metrics are financially representative of our identity as a technology company. From revenue mix, growth, contracted backlog, and our low capital intensity, our metrics demonstrate the strength of the Trimble financial model. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, stands at approximately $1 billion in the quarter. This is the first time we have presented this metric and this metric demonstrates the attractiveness of the underlying revenue profile. Before turning to guidance and update on acquisitions, Viewpoint and e-Builder continued to demonstrate strength in the quarter with strong bookings growth in both businesses. On the e-Builder side, indicative of their strong leadership and process strength, we have moved some of our project management solutions over to their management team to run. On the Viewpoint side, in the months since we have owned the business, it is clear that we have acquired a leader in construction management software. The integrated suite of office, team and field workflows continues to mature with the recent release of a native integration between the ERP and the management of time, equipment, and labor in the field. This integration enables project controls in a unique manner in the industry. Further, we are already demonstrating client success of cross-selling solutions. Finally the financial model is healthy with the combined revenue mix at over 70% recurring and a bookings mix that is increasingly shifting towards subscription over perpetual. As Steve mentioned, we acquired Veltec a few weeks ago, and on slide 6, you will see an overview of the business and the strategic rationale. The Veltec business is at the beginning stages of a conversion to SaaS. Therefore, the top- and bottom-line headline financial results do not tell the full story of what is an attractive business in a compelling market context in Brazil. Let's now move to the fourth quarter and total year guidance on slide 14. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue of $791 million to $821 million and EPS of $0.44 to $0.48 per share. Two comments to add color to our fourth quarter guidance. First, revenue. On one side, our guidance reflects incremental uncertainty we see with trade and geopolitics, the strengthening U.S. dollar and the micro effects that Steve mentioned in his commentary. On the other side, our guidance reflects the competitive strength of our franchises, continued organic growth and acquisition performance. One note on the Veltec acquisition, it does not move the revenue needle in the fourth quarter as it is in the early stages of a SaaS transition. Second, EPS. The implied EPS reflects the resiliency of our model and the actions we have taken over the last couple of years to balance our exposure and to exit non-core activities. In addition, I'd like to remind investors that in the fourth quarter, we have our biannual Dimensions user conference, which is an incremental multimillion-dollar expense. In addition, Veltec is dilutive for two to three quarters because of the timing of the SaaS transition. And lastly, equity income from our joint ventures normally trends down sequentially in the fourth quarter. Moving to full year 2018 guidance, for the full year, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $3.13 billion to $3.16 billion, and we expect full year non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.89 and $1.93, which is above our previously announced range. Let's step back for a moment and put our full year 2018 financial expectations into context. With an assumption of achieving fourth quarter results within our guidance range, the compelling value we are creating in the marketplace is translating through to our financial model. For 2018, we expect to deliver total revenue growth in the range of 18% to 19% with approximately 10% organic growth. We expect to achieve gross margin expansion of about 200 basis points as a result of pricing discipline and through organic and inorganic growth in our software businesses. Further, we expect our total year revenue mix to be approximately 50% software, services and recurring. Walking down the P&L, we expect that our management of the portfolio and the operating expenses will translate into EBITDA margin expansion of about 200 basis points and EPS growth greater than 30% year-over-year. Finally, we expect to achieve a record level of operating cash flow. This is a testament to our customers who are deploying our transformative technology, and to our employees around the world who make this possible. Before moving to Q&A, a brief word on 2019. While it's too early to say anything definitive about 2019, I will comment that our current expectation is to achieve the growth and margin expansion model that we put forward at Investor Day. This view is 6% to 9% organic growth and operating leverage in the range of 25% to 30% over a multiyear period. This baseline provides an initial view of how we see the business next year. In addition for 2019, specifically, we expect our recent acquisitions to provide a little more than 3 points of additional growth. We also expect to incrementally accelerate the transition of license revenue towards subscription revenue, primarily in our Construction business and, secondarily, in our Transportation business. Let's now take your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good evening.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Hey, Ann.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Perhaps, first just on the quarter, if I look at your operating expenses, it looks like R&D grew at 22%, sales and marketing 19% and general and admin at 24%. Can you just talk about – I know you mentioned the Dimensions conference, but should we take the Q3 now that we have the new acquisitions in there and kind of use Q3 as a run rate for 2019 for those line items or is there anything one-off that occurred in Q3?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, what would be seasonal in Q3 is, of course, things like a PTO and vacations. But in terms of, let's say, the profile and the mix of the operating expenses, it's a reasonable baseline.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, because there shouldn't be much seasonality in R&D or sales and marketing or G&A?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: No, aside from what you would see is things like different PTO policies we have in the business or some are people taking PTO and – right. That's a thing that would move expenses from quarter to – operating expenses from quarter to quarter. We also have trade shows, but you already picked that up as Q4.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure we're modeling that correctly. And then from a more structural standpoint, I mean, I know you talked about U.S. farmers and the China tariff and being able to look to Brazil to offset any decline in sales from the U.S. But I'm assuming you wouldn't be able to offset dollar for dollar, immediately. I mean you have to build out a business in Brazil before you'd be able to like make up for any decline in the U.S. Is that the right way to think about this?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: I think that's probably a sober way of looking at it, Ann. First of all, we haven't necessarily seen that kind of effect in the U.S. We're anticipating that there will be some effect. But then during the quarter, I was in Brazil and the Brazilian farmers are moving very quickly. So, I don't know exactly what will offset what and to what degree. But I think that, one, we have yet really to see any real effects in the U.S. So, we're being a little sober in terms of projecting an effect. But then I wouldn't doubt given the growth we've seen year-to-date already in Brazil and the temperament in Brazil to invest and invest heavily, I think, maybe we could make a pretty good go of it in terms of offsetting effects, but we'll have to see.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just finally just on the transportation acquisition in Brazil. I mean if we look at an industry that behaves pretty irrationally, it's the transportation industry, specifically in Brazil, can you talk about any kind of volatility you might anticipate there or what's the size of that acquisition, or how much did that add to net debt-to-EBITDA, just any way of dimensioning the kind of risk we might see from that business?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So in terms of the kind of relative size, it fits the profile of more of our tuck-in-size acquisitions, in that kind of $25 million or less purchase price range. So, I'm giving range when I say that. The business itself is one of the leading providers in the market. And when we look at the customer base, we look at the customer base to understand volatility, we might expect more – because it's an aftermarket business, this isn't an OEM business. So, I think of the volatility different, an OEM versus aftermarket. In fact many of the customers we have in the aftermarket are the multinationals who are now asking us to provide a global solution, because we may be working with a given customer in North America, Europe and the U.S. already today.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful and I'll follow up offline. Thank you. I appreciate the color.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: No problem.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to start with the Viewpoint and e-Builder acquisitions. I think you talked about it performing well this quarter. I just wanted to get a sense now that you had both businesses for a little bit of time, what may be surprised you relative to your expectations? And what, within those businesses, has done particularly well?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, to be honest, as I think that if there have been surprises, they've been positive surprises. In terms of how well the three management groups have been able to coalesce and create common cause. And then, down in the organizations, the honest enthusiasm for pursuing the vision that we certainly were pursuing when we acquired them. So I would say that, at the high level in terms of the intangibles of it, the surprises have been, if anything, positive or at least within expectations, but maybe weighted towards the positive side. I think there's a fair amount of complexity to wade through. People are kind of persistently going at wading through the issues in terms of, okay, product rationalization and dividing up market space and determining go-to-market strategies. So I'll let Rob deal with the details of it to the extent that there are details here. But I would just color the thing pretty positively. And would say that there have been no meaningful negative surprises that have come about as a result of the deals. Employees are in place, management's in place, everybody is pretty much converged on which direction to pursue. Rob, do you have anything?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: And to add maybe a little color, let's say, if I take Viewpoint, for example, on the financial model, as we're seeing a faster shift than we expected. And I'd call this a positive, a faster shift onto the subscription model over the perpetual for the new bookings. So when we look at the ratio of that for new bookings, it's a fair amount ahead of where we expected it to be. So it's clearly a mid- to long-term tailwind for the business and for the business model. The other place, where I'd say, from a business model perspective, that's been an incremental surprise is there's a conversion that happens from the business, from the support and maintenance base over to a subscription. And so we're generating – the team is generating an uplift on those perpetual, maintenance fees that's well ahead of what we expected it to be. And so again, those are the kind of underlying, let's say, metrics and trends that will bode well for the business in the mid to long term. On the e-Builder side, it was a business that was growing at a very healthy clip and quite profitable when we acquired it, and that has continued. And so we see significant year-over-year increase in the underlying bookings. And so that helps us as we look forward now and starting to look forward into 2019 and beyond to have that much more confidence in the business model as we go forward.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Perfect. And then just as a follow-up, Steve, you referenced the multiple micro impacts that you're seeing that roll up in aggregate to be maybe a little bit more meaningful. Is there a way that you can maybe provide a little bit of context on maybe rank ordering the size of some of these impacts? Or giving us a sense of magnitude around each of them?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, I think none of them actually at this point rise to, let's call it, the status of kind of being worth talking about. I think it's just the aggregation of them caused the – it took a little bit off the edge for the third quarter. In terms of those that I would tend to look at most seriously at this point in time, I think it's probably the issues around trade. I think that one has longer-term implications. And I think probably, from our perspective, longer term than are generally assumed out there in the wider community. For example, I suspect that the switch from Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural product to Brazil is not a temporary issue, but is going to effectively turn out to be permanent or close to permanent. The one effect that did affect us and kind of changed the trend of recent times is foreign exchange, just the general foreign exchange rates. And then particularly the – again, kind of the micro effects in Turkey and Russia and Brazil are affecting buying patterns there. But foreign exchange was slightly a negative impact to us in revenue in the quarter. So it's having that effect. But I would say, more significantly, it is having an effect in terms of the markets in Turkey, Russia and Brazil. So at this point in time, none of them are I'd say material to us, but some have the potential for becoming longer term and more meaningful issues.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon and good evening.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Rob, I'm wondering if you could provide the kind of subscriber user growth that you're seeing in e-Builder and Viewpoint? And can you share with us what the apples to apples organic growth look like for each business?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, in the e-Builder – well, actually both businesses, we're talking double-digit increases. So the e-Builder business predominantly serves the owner segment, so public and private owners. And that was a business that was growing over 20% a year when we acquired it. And that is playing through, the bookings year-to-date are growing faster than that. So I think that's the right way to look at it. We have well over 100,000 users who work on the e-Builder platform, managing over – or working on over 250,000 projects. Give you a data point, there has been over 7 million log-ins into the e-Builder system in 2018. So just from a sense of intensity of use, it's a mission-critical system for owners to manage those projects. And then on the Viewpoint side, to let's say go back to when we introduced the deal, that's a company with over 8,000 customers today, that segment roughly a third, a third, a third, mechanical/electrical/ plumbing contractors, civil contractors, and building contractors and each of those have their own unique, let's say, strategies and each of them uniquely map up to different elements of Trimble. And so we're seeing some really interesting activities happen between, let's say, the mechanical/electrical/plumbing team where we have estimating technologies in Trimble that maps well and favorable to the job cost system that Viewpoint manages and then that can round trip to understanding who the customers are from Viewpoint. And we actually had a couple of examples of selling field technologies that we have in the MEP realm to those contractors and starting to make those introductions. So, good things happening in both.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And Rob, are you willing to share with us the churn that you're experiencing on those businesses?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: The easiest one to describe is from the e-Builder business. So, the net – again, I would characterize it in terms of net retention ratio. The net retention ratio is over 100%. I think it's around 103%, 104%. That means that we're driving penetration in up-selling the existing base at a faster rate than which we're churning. So, the churn is a low-single digit we see in that business and it's very similar to the profile of e-Builder. In fact, to go and bend (38:57) another sort of – sorry, similar to profiling Viewpoint, that what we see in e-Builder and Viewpoint, I think a data point for that is when we're converting the customers who are already on a support and maintenance agreement over to the subscription, that's happening in the form of an uplift in the revenue. So in other words, as they convert over to subscription base, it's at a multiple times the level of what they're paying today. And we're doing that by value delivery. So, the ability to bring, we call it, the OTF, office/team/field solution to those customers, is delivering value that then translates into ability to upsell that. And so, that would look like, from a net retention perspective, if you're looking at that tranche of revenue, you'd see a significant net retention ratio on those.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And you folks talked about expectations for a 6% to 9% organic growth in 2019. Is that net of the transition to Software-as-a-Service? And can you just expand, I think you – correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you mentioned that you're pushing towards a Software-as-a-Service transition in Transportation as well. Can you flesh that out a bit?.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Jerry. So, the short answer is yes, that is inclusive of the transition, the 6% to 9%. Where we end up in that 6% to 9%, I think, correlates to, let's say, the speed or pace, velocity of the transition, but it is planned within that range. And it's consistent with what we had put up at Investor Day. To give you a couple examples – specific examples in the construction realm, we've already been talking about it from Viewpoint and that accelerates the other business that has a conversion is the SketchUp business, the 3D modeling software that we have for architects, designers and makers. And so, we're beginning a transition in that business. We're actually beginning now, but we're really – for all intents and purposes, really will kick in, in the first quarter. And so, that's a significant transition for that business. And then, in the Transportation realm, we have subscription – we already have subscription offering in PeopleNet. That's the base business model, the onboard computer, and then it comes with a subscription associated with it. In our enterprise business, more the TMW software side, which is a Transportation Management System. So, it's the backbone system for our trucking company. We have a subscription today, but it's really primarily – if you look at the revenue base today, it's primarily a license sale with a long-tail support and maintenance agreement associated with it. And we're beginning to, let's say, speed that up and focus on that. So, that'd be the area in Transportation, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Hey. I think that's me. Rob Wertheimer, Melius Research.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Hi, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: All right. Great. Hello. Excellent. So, you are fairly clear in your comments, but my first question is just, can you characterize your feel for the construction markets right now? Seems relatively hot. Labor is tight. Are you seeing pockets of weakness really outside of government or not? And as the tightness driving any incremental interest in going digital for labor saving reasons? My first.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Let me give you the high-level view and maybe Rob's got some detail to throw out there. But I would say at this point in time, we're not seeing, what I would recall, pockets of weakness that are meaningful. I think there are certain regions of the world that are slower, but none of the major regions at this point in time. So, I think that we're kind of reading the headlines, like everyone else, and speculating a little bit about the future. But at this moment in time, I don't think we're driving anything from the construction markets that would cause us concern ourselves in terms of direct evidence. A lot of contractors are still sitting out there with two years worth of backlog and, as you point out, are desperate in terms of finding ways to complete that backlog. So, I think that hard to put specific data around it, but I think that the shortage of labor is definitely impacting the industry. It's a major complaint among contractors. So, I think that right now the markets are – remain strong and we're seeing kind of no shifts at this point.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Great. Perfect. And the second question is more just how you approach it? I mean the Veltec acquisition is interesting. Is this a situation where you expect to be bringing a lot of either product or technology or streamlining a software, or is it standalone? I'm just a little bit curious since you have strengths in that area, how that translates internationally to what do you bring to acquisitions?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think that kind of looking at the drivers of it. First, Brazil is just too big of a market to ignore in the long term, okay? It's got its current set of issues. It's relatively confused place at this point in time. But you look at the 5 to 10, it's just too big of a market and too vibrant and robust of a market to ignore. It's kind of starting point. We have a strong presence in agriculture. We have taken steps over the last few years to strengthen our position in agriculture in terms of our go-to-market capabilities. Construction right at the moment is a fairly dormant issue for us. Given the issues of the last few years in Brazil, there isn't much of a construction market really to pursue. And so, we're just waiting for that to revive. But the market that is – where there's definitely a need set in Brazil is transportation. Brazil is inherently limited by its transportation system, whether it be road or rail. And so, there's a lot of opportunity for us to bring technology into some of these realms and have an impact. So, I think we pointed out that, okay, we've got some, I think, special plays into – particularly into agriculture and forestry where we can take our transportation solutions into those industries on kind of a focused basis. But then I think that in terms of what does Trimble have to offer Veltec, what does Trimble have to offer Brazil. There is a lot of product functionality. There is a lot of product capability sitting in our repository outside of Brazil that we can bring to Brazil. So, we can actually stage manage in the next year or two a great deal of innovation in Brazil, simply by bringing in capabilities from other parts of the world. So, all in all, we see Veltec as a platform play, it's a beginning point, it's a beachhead, and we believe we can grow it.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Great. Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital Markets.
Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: Hey, thanks for taking my question. The first one is just around the kind of predictability of your business model. If you think about it, you said ARR is approaching around $1 billion now, which is around one-third of your revenue. So, how do you see your margins being exposed, if you had to compare it in terms of the risk during the previous cycles? So, it's really of how defensive your margin is this time around compared to what happened in, say, 2014 or even 2009 period? Thank you.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So, good afternoon, Gal. So hey, one thing I'd probably reference back to one on the Investor Day things we showed was the portfolio mix of the business going back. I think we compared it 2012 to 2017, but you could – 2012 could be a proxy for 2014 timeframe as well. And if you go back a few years ago, the business model had, I think, over 70% of the revenue – or excuse me, over 70% – 75% of the operating income was coming from two of our segments, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities. And I think it was about 60% of the revenue was coming from Geospatial and Resources and Utilities. You fast forward to 2017 and – want to say, 2017, that 76% of operating income that came from two reporting segments moved to 48%. And so, when you look at the balance we have of revenue and operating income in the business today, it's fundamentally different than where we were, whether you're comparing to 2014 or 2012. When you look at the revenue mix, which is what you're getting at, when you look at the level of recurring revenue we have today versus the level of recurring revenue we had going back a few years ago, that continues to move significantly up and as you note the $1 billion of ARR, if you're looking at the recurring revenue mix. That clearly brings more predictability to the business model, more software in the – obviously, more software in the portfolio as well. So as we think about then what that could look like and if you were modeling what that could look like on the up or the down, I guess, by the way, it's, I'd say, much less exposed to any individual given segment than we have been in the past.
Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Just have a follow-up in terms of the business model transition, there's been a few questions on it, but I just – I'm trying to think about the software part of the business. I don't know if you've ever looked at or thought about the way the revenues are growing at the moment, especially in terms of the reported revenues for software compared to the actual underlying bookings growth as a total. Can you give us any sort of indication of how much of a headwind to revenue compared to bookings this is today in terms of the new licenses? Thank you.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, what we see is that – and I think I'm probably making your point. What we see is the bookings are growing faster than the revenue that we're recognizing in the businesses. I don't have a ratio off the top of my head, I'm sorry, to quote for that. And then we could have different – right, we have a number of different types of software businesses between the perpetual we have and the SaaS businesses we already have, some in transition and then different segments. I'm not sure even at a company level that it may be like looking at our gross margins that it tells an incomplete story. But in the businesses like e-Builder, Viewpoint, and some of the other software business, I'll say, larger software businesses taking an 80/20 principle, we do continue to see the bookings growth outstripping the revenue that we're recognizing. And then as we think about the way we manage the business and we think about playing that forward, let's say, into 2019 or into a future period, particularly if you're looking at the recurring revenue, you can get a very good sense of what should be on the books for 2019. And then, as we plan the growth model for businesses, it makes for a relatively straightforward conversation around what the go-get is to complete the revenue, let's say, for a following period. And then from that aspect, you can look at the pipeline coverage you have against that go-get revenue. And then, we have metrics that we track for each of those stages of what arguably is pipeline management.
Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: That's helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. Hey, Rob, can we just talk for a second or two about the Building and Infrastructure business? With the core at plus 7%, my question would just be, did that fall a little bit short of plan? And if yes, is that part of the subscription move to deferred revenue? Or is either one of the pieces, BIM or civil construction, did they come up a little bit short in the quarter? Or I'm just curious if you've seen any kind of slowdown? If not, if that's a software-driven headwind?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So the Buildings and Infrastructure segment was a little bit short of revenue. Transportation was the segment that was ahead of the expectations. So we come into the quarter with an expectation by segment or by business, and there's always puts and takes along the way. Within Buildings and Infrastructure, if I look at it, we can look at it by revenue type or we can look at it by end market. If we're looking at it by end market, and it's more the vertical and horizontal construction, the vertical construction was at or really above the plan we had in the quarter. And on the horizontal side, a little bit short. Steve mentioned one of the micro effects on the U.S. government orders. So that's one of the businesses in the civil construction that got nicked a little bit there, that's hardware. From a – now if I'm going, I'm backing up and I'm talking software, no headwinds to speak of on the software. One area where we came, just give you an example, a couple million short on software would have been actually in Viewpoint versus my expectations. But that was on me, because when we acquired the company, it was under 605 accounting. And so in the process of acquiring them, we had to move them to 606. And so we made estimates for what the 606 revenue would look like, and that was different by a couple million. That has no reflection whatsoever on the business or the underlying health of the business. So that would be an example that really to me had no meaning, underlying meaning associated with that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Again is that – that presumably would influence the op profit there, because there wasn't a great deal of operating leverage in this business in the Buildings and Infrastructure. And again, I'm thinking, is that the influence of the civil construction business? Or again, move from 605 to 606 probably would do that, too?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, really, the 605, 606, I wouldn't go there to talk about op leverage.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Viewpoint in its first quarter under Trimble, profitability – percent profitability is below the segment average. And so that's – if you were trying to maybe look versus last year and see a sequential up and wondering if you would have seen a sequential flat or a sequential up from Q2 to Q3, we didn't see that. Or if you're looking year-over-year, you see it go down – the OI percentage go down year-over-year. And that's really discretely the Viewpoint effect. So you take Viewpoint out and the margins were up in the business. So we know where Viewpoint is in its cycle in the transition. And we see an actually really short runway for that to be above, if really not well above, the segment average. And all of that is consistent with what we communicated to investors when we did the deal. In fact, the profitability is ahead of where we communicated to investors when we did the deal. So very much within expectations. Another thing, Rick, you asked about on the software side, just to fill in one more blank. The Viewpoint business did see a higher mix of subscriptions than perpetual, than what we expected. So if you would have seen more perpetual revenue, you would have seen that come just a little bit more into the quarter. And when that underlying revenue shifts to subscription, that's going to have an impact in the very short term in a individual quarter but is a very good thing for the mid- to long-term health of the business.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sure. Understood. Understood. And then, just a last question, when I look at the fourth quarter guide from a revenue perspective, it looks like maybe the midpoint of, what I'll call, the implied guide when you gave second quarter...
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, is maybe down about $20 million. And my question is, I would think FX headwind might be 1 point or so in the fourth quarter. I mean that would be about a third of it. And then would the other, say, two-thirds kind of be these micro effects and some conservatism?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: You're pretty much spot on. So just to – yeah, if we level set on the revised range, that's a 13% to 17% growth year-over-year, so 15% at the mid. We would see M&A being 9% to 10% growth, organic, call it, in the 5% to 8% growth range, and then FX, a headwind of 1%. So when we look at that delta that you started with on the midpoint, I'd actually call about half of that FX as opposed to a third, but call it a little closer to a half than a third. And that hits really all the segments, albeit Transportation less so because that's more North American-centric, that business. And then the other half is a mix of the micro effects that Steve talked about and some of the trade, geopolitical.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hi. This is Kristen on for Colin. Thank you for taking our questions. Just wanted to follow up on the transportation logistics, sort of rebranding that you announced at the in.sight user conference. Just wondering if you can provide some color. Is that indicative of these higher-level conversations that you're having? And where do you see the opportunities for cross-selling within that platform and sort of the information sharing that you're getting there?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So I think the users conference was, shall we say, a major affirmation in terms of the view that there is significant opportunity for cross (58:39) sharing. So the PeopleNet and TMW acquisitions are now getting to be, what, six years ago. We were not in a rush to essentially kind of force a one brand concept there, because at the time PeopleNet had a distinct universe of customers. TMW had their own universe. There was some crossover, but it was kind of two distinct universes. I think consistent with the other Trimble businesses, this idea of being able to offer soup to nuts, being able to offer the comprehensive solution that engages both the enterprise and the mobile assets and look at it comprehensively has become more and more attractive as the technology has advanced. It's not universal. There are PeopleNet customers who use a competitor TMW and probably vice versa. That still exists and we're perfectly comfortable with that. But I think the opportunity for selling a comprehensive solution of offering the C-level suite at some of these companies, one-stop shopping with the advantages of full and complete integration, I think that has become increasingly more attractive. And we made the decision in the last, well, 12 to 18 months really to recognize the reality. So, this was really the rollout of the Trimble brand in Transportation, no equivocation. And I would say the response from the user group was highly enthusiastic to the idea of a Trimble brand as opposed to distinct TMW or PeopleNet brands. So, yeah, I think it was turned out to be a major success for us.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And then just as a follow up on that, you called out some strength in the mobility side of that business, maybe coming in ahead of expectations. Can you tell us what was the mix of mobility versus enterprise?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Reasonably consistent with the mix we normally see, Kristen. But mobility, in the end, did push the whole segment – reporting segment up. The business had introduced some new product in the quarter and I think executed pretty well in the quarter as well to drive themselves forward. And if I even kind of, let's say, maybe up level it for that, well, the sentiment we hear from trucking companies at the moment is that the trucking companies are busy and the drivers shortages are gating factor in the industry. And then, at the same time, their costs are going up. So labor and gas is going up. And so, on one hand, you see pockets where trucking companies are too busy to pause and use the technology or implement the technology. And then in other pocket, you see them clamoring for the technology to help them retain drivers and optimize routes and increase the efficiency to handle the work. So, there's multiple things play at the same time here. And maybe the other thing too is given that mobility business has always been or historically been a subscription business, obviously, comes with the hardware at the beginning as well. I mean, there's an element of the cumulative effect of subscriber base there. So in aggregate, a really solid quarter from the teams in that segment.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And then, just the last question, you announced the GM Super Cruise program with Cadillac early on in the year. Saw that got really good positive reviews from Consumer Reports. We saw the announcement that they wanted to roll that out to their entire GM lineup by 2020. Does that have any implications for you guys in the autonomy space?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: I think it does. And when we think about the autonomy space, we'll tend to describe it as automation. And if you think about it in an automation context, there's both the historic markets we serve such as civil construction or heavy construction and agriculture being the two primary ones. And then these newer activities have been in more in the automotive space. So, I'd say the cumulative – going back to 40 years history of Trimble and leadership in positioning technologies, prevision – positioning technologies, whether it's GNSS, laser, optical, inertial, sensors, there's a legacy there that cumulatively plays forward into the markets that we've served. That continues to help us innovate, and we'll have some new stuff we'll be showing at Dimensions next week in that realm. And then as it goes into the automotive – in the automotive realm, we've seen business that we have – or businesses that we have really kind of Geospatial-oriented technologies for high-definition mapping that autonomous car companies are using and deploying, and it's driven business for us. We see demand for treating systems that we sell for, well, ultimately our autonomous applications. And finally, really to the point of what you described, GM Super Cruise, one of the – I'd call it, real star businesses we have in the Trimble – inside of Trimble is our correction services business. And so, it's the ability to get ubiquitous, absolute position, high convergence time, high accuracy, and historically have been used in more of the industrial applications and so has a role, and sensor fusion in the automotive space. And so, that does seem to be generating more interest whether it's from the tier 1s or from the OEMs themselves or even at the silicon-level providers. So, there's a number of different ways in which we see activity happening in that business.
Operator: Unfortunately, we have run out of time for questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Michael Leyba for closing remarks.
Michael Leyba - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you, Victoria, and thank you to everyone for attending today's call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Vincent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Michael Leyba, with Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Michael Leyba - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Vincent. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. In addition, we will also be posting our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website at investor.trimble.com shortly after the completion of this call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. I would also like to briefly mention that we will be attending the Raymond James SMID Cap Growth Conference on August 21 in Chicago and the JPMorgan 'All Stars' conference on September 18 in London. With that, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Good afternoon. I will start by commenting on the quarter's results and then report on progress on some of the themes we laid out at the Investor Day in May. I will loosely follow up the content starting on slide 4. This quarter's narrative remains more or less the same as those of the last year, emphasizing strength across both businesses and regions. Reported revenue growth was 19% with organic revenue growth remaining in double digits. Reported non-GAAP operating margins improved by 2.6 points versus the second quarter last year. An even more positive perspective is to look at our fundamental operating performance without the effects of acquisitions made in the last year. This organic view reflects year-to-year non-GAAP operating margin expansion of over 3 points and operating leverage of over 45%. This operational strength reinforces our view that we are both leveraging current market success into a more robust financial model while we simultaneously add strategic muscle through internal developments and selective acquisitions. A current consideration revolves around tariff actions and the associated rhetoric. Although we have been negatively affected by the imposition of U.S. tariffs on imports from China, the effect is not material to overall results. If the environment continues to shift, we are well positioned to deal with changing circumstances. Our robust international supply chain will enable us to flex and mitigate effects. In addition to managing the supply chain, we will also be able to adapt to shifts in international demand patterns. For example, if Brazil replaces the U.S. as the provider to China for certain agricultural crops, we will be able to benefit from the ramp-up of Brazilian farms. Another point of general observation is that the Trimble portfolio has a healthier balance than at any point in Trimble's history, and we'll be resilient in the face of downturns for specific industries. That said, when we look at our major franchises, we see no signs of a pending slowdown in the market for construction technology, particularly as our direct exposure to machine sales has declined in a relative sense, with increased software content. Agricultural indicators relating to commodity prices and new machine sales remain down from historical levels, and do not present many obvious downside possibilities. Trimble's transportation market, which is currently strong, is generally resistant to industry cycles because technology implementation tends to be driven by multi-year decision making and fleet technology upgrades are not directly tied to new truck sales. The Geospatial segment when compared to 2015 has a lower relative exposure to oil and gas and a generally more diverse book of business. At the Investor Day, we laid out the path for achieving long-term annual growth in the range of 9% to 12%. These levels of growth result from our central role in pioneering the digitization of targeted large and mature industries. Our market leadership is enabled by our unique capability to connect the physical and digital worlds together with our deep domain knowledge. This combination allows us to provide highly innovative solutions explicitly tailored to our targeted markets. We believe we have the elements in place to execute our strategy. Our priorities therefore are on execution and our objective is to perform to our potential. At the Investor Day, we quantified the size of our addressable markets and the significant opportunity available to us to penetrate these markets. Our internal measures of success are therefore focused on progress in market penetration rather than a more budgetary view of incremental improvement. The other internal execution focus is around a concept we call 343 which refers to the time periods of three months, four quarters and three years. It is intended to avoid the incrementalism of a quarterly forecast and to ensure that our three year execution carries equal importance with current quarter results. Our execution focus includes six elements. The first is our continuing focus on markets and product lines that can produce profits and growth. Our continuous evaluation of the sources of success has resulted in an ongoing pruning of our underperforming product lines and initiatives that cannot be fixed in a reasonable time period. Although these activities have been incremental and generally fall below the materiality radar screen, the aggregate effect has contributed to margin improvement and will contribute more in the future. The second execution element is a focus on achieving tangible benefits from cross-company collaboration. One benefit of collaboration is ensuring technologies and products to leverage our scale and expertise. The other benefit is the creation of unique market opportunities. Let me provide two practical examples, one opportunistic, the other more strategic. We have owned ALK since 2013 and include its results with the transportation segment. ALK provides maps with extended attributes, and generally targeted at commercial transportation applications. Since virtually all Trimble businesses require maps of one type or another, ALK has become a provider of maps to most other Trimble businesses and enabled us to regard the map as part of a unique and differentiated solution. An alternative more strategic example of the potential collaboration exists within Brazilian agriculture. I was recently in Brazil and visited both large farms and plantation forests. The scale of these operations is accurately described as gigantic. Without any meaningful government support, these operations are directly exposed to market forces and must rely heavily on technological innovation to remain competitive. This need for technology extends beyond farming operations to elements of infrastructure, logistics and processing and will result in a need for solutions from all four Trimble segments. By providing a complete and unified technology strategy to these operators, Trimble can achieve both a special relationship and a significant competitive advantage. The third point of execution focus is on implementing the 343 program and closely linking three year end game objectives to current actions. We are evolving and emphasizing a management process that focuses on the link of future outcomes to current actions. We are using strategic planning and execution tools such as Hoshin throughout the organization to achieve appropriate levels of transparency and discipline. The fourth execution element is a proactive effort to transition our business models. The most obvious initiative, which Rob will highlight, is the intention to transition more businesses to a subscription model. Beyond the move to subscriptions, other related elements include a more comprehensive reliance on cloud based architectures, bundle pricing and hardware as a service. The fifth point of execution focus is achieving effective leverage from our recent acquisitions, most notably Müller, e-Builder and Viewpoint. Müller, which has been in the portfolio for a year, is performing as expected with significant efforts underway in collaborative product development and market initiatives. It is clear that Müller has been able to access market segments that were previously denied to it by leveraging the Trimble presence. On the other side, Trimble has achieved greater access to agricultural OEMs through the historical Müller network. The early signs are that the combined elements of e-Builder, Viewpoint and existing Trimble construction software are performing on or above target. More importantly, all three organizations have identified significant market upsides that are available through collaboration. With the completed acquisition of Viewpoint, we are now engaged in developing and deploying a comprehensive plan of action. The sixth point of consideration is innovation, which is at the heart of any future Trimble success. We spent approximately 14% of revenue on R&D during the trailing 12 months, and expect to maintain it at that relative level to feed revenue growth and operating leverage. Our innovation efforts are targeted at the ongoing transformation of the construction, agriculture and transportation industries with emerging opportunities to include new technology classes such as augmented reality, autonomy and blockchain in these solution sets. Before turning the call over to Rob, let me emphasize that in many ways the relative operating performance in the quarter represents the most impressive performance in Trimble's history and is a credit to Trimble's employees' commitment to improve. We expect to follow with more quarters of strong performance. Rob?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you all for joining us today. Our second quarter performance was strong and ahead of expectations. Looking at our results for the first and second quarters, we remained favorably positioned in the market and we are raising guidance for the year. Let's start on slide 7 with a review of the second quarter results. Top line and bottom line results came in ahead of plan, meeting or significantly exceeding expectations in all reporting segments. Second quarter total revenue was about $786 million, up 19% year-over-year. Breaking that down, currency translation added about 2% and acquisitions added about 5%. Organic growth was approximately 12%. Second quarter gross margins were 57.1%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, reflecting favorable product mix as well as favorable pricing dynamics. During Investor Day, we said that we would start to introduce some new metrics to investors. Adjusted EBITDA is now on this table and is relevant as it captures the income from our joint ventures and equity investments. We delivered EBITDA of 22.7% in the second quarter, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Operating income dollars increased 36% to approximately $160 million with operating margin increasing 260 basis points to 20.4%. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined from 23% to 19% year-over-year, reflecting U.S. tax reform. Our net income was up about 36% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.50, up $0.14 or 39% year-over-year. Reflecting the strong cash flow profile of the company, deferred revenue was up 16% year-over-year and the net working capital including the deferred revenue was less than 3% of trailing 12-month revenue. Cash flow from operations was approximately $185 million and was up 24% year-over-year. To cover our debt profile in anticipation of the July 2 deal closure of Viewpoint, in the month of June, we entered into new credit facilities and raised $900 million of bonds. In connection with the closing of Viewpoint, we drew down on those credit facilities. We currently stand at gross debt of $2.2 billion and net debt of $1.9 billion which represents 3.2 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, which is ahead of plan and favorable relative to what we previously communicated. We retained our investment grade rating and we remain committed to delevering the balance sheet. Turning now to slide 8. Let's go through the revenue details at the reporting segment level. Revenue was up double digit organically in each segment with Buildings & Infrastructure leading the way with about 15% organic growth, and the other three reporting segments each posting about 10% organic growth. In short, all reporting segments and all major geographies continued to perform. Furthermore, our recent acquisitions, including e-Builder, collectively performed ahead of expectations. Recognizing that the performance at any individual quarter alone is incomplete, we will also start sharing trailing 12-month performance looking back both one and three years. In short, on a three-year basis, our performance fits the growth model we talked about at Investor Day with clear acceleration over the last year. Slide 9 provides the geographic revenue mix in the company. The Müller acquisition, in combination with organic growth in Europe, shifted our mix towards Europe this quarter as compared to same quarter last year. On a longitudinal basis, our addressable market analysis points towards attractive penetration opportunities outside of North America and we seek to diversify this revenue base in the years to come. While we're talking about geographies, let me add a little color to Steve's comments on trade and tariffs related to China. From a tariff perspective, we estimate our exposed revenue to U.S. imports from China to be less than 0.25%. From a trade perspective, China represents less than 5% of company revenue. While our institutional view is that tariffs and obstacles to trade are a definitive negative, we feel the current situation is within our ability to manage. Let's turn to slide 10 and look at our revenue mix by type on a trailing 12-month basis. The revenue mix is comprised of 52% hardware and 48% or $1.4 billion of software services and recurring revenue. That $1.4 billion breaks down into recurring revenue and software and services revenue. Recurring revenue, which is mainly comprised of subscription revenue and support and maintenance agreements, is now over $790 million on a trailing 12-month basis or 27% of total revenue. Software and services, which is mainly comprised of perpetual and term licenses as well as professional services, represents $590 million of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Each revenue type continues to grow double digit, reflecting strength across the entire business. The move towards software and recurring revenue streams is one of the topics that we are most often asked about with our business. At Investor Day, we said that with the inclusion of Viewpoint that we believe we will cross the 50% threshold in 2018 and that by 2021 we would have approximately 55%, or over $2 billion in revenue, from software services and recurring. These numbers are highlighted on slide 4. From a software revenue mix perspective, we continue to see more of our software moving towards subscription business model offerings. For example, we had previously disclosed that our SketchUp business will move to SaaS starting at the end of this year and products such as our Tekla Structure software in buildings and TMW in transportation already have subscription add-on offerings. We've identified a number of areas where we will intensify the pivot towards subscription. As we assess the pace and impact of the conversion, we will refine and communicate any associated impacts on our mid to long range business model. Moving now to slide 11, let's go through the operating income details at a reporting segment level. At a company level, operating income was 20.4% with operating leverage at 34%. Excluding acquisitions, operating income was over 21% with operating leverage of greater than 45%. Drivers of margin expansion were similar across each of the reporting segments while gross margins expanded based on product mix and pricing. And combined with operating expense management, this enabled us to expand our operating margins. Parallel to the commentary on revenue, we are also disclosing our trailing 12-month operating income performance looking back both one and three years. Just like revenue, on a three-year basis our performance fits the growth model we talked about at Investor Day with clear acceleration over the last year. Turning to page 12, the seven metrics listed here are financially representative of our identity as a technology company. From revenue mix, growth, contracted backlog and our low capital intensity, our metrics conform to those of technology companies. Beginning in the third quarter, we anticipate beginning to disclose annualized recurring revenue as an additional important software metric. Turning to slide 13. The most non-linear events of 2018 for Trimble has been the capital deployment put towards acquiring e-Builder and Viewpoint. In addition to Müller, these represent our largest outlay of capital in our history. Steve already commented on positive performance we've seen from Müller over the past year. The e-Builder acquisition closed in February and we remain very bullish on the business and the market opportunity. Revenue and profitability have exceeded our plan thus far. The market is validating the strength of the business as evidenced by subscription bookings growing over 30% on a year-to-date basis, which also positions the business to extend its performance into next year. Customers are validating the technology as measured by double digit increases in the usage of the product as well as a net retention ratio that exceeds 100%. The Viewpoint acquisition closed on July 2 and the business comes into Trimble with momentum. The Viewpoint business already has over 70% recurring revenue and has been pivoting to a subscription based model with its office team and field offering. Greater than 70% of new bookings in the second quarter were subscriptions and the subscription bookings have grown approximately 70% on a year-to-date basis. Coming into Trimble, the revenue and profitability are ahead of our previously disclosed expectations. Customers continue to validate the attractiveness of the combination and are already showing us possibilities we previously did not see such as integration of data feeds from our transportation business into the construction ERP systems. The office team and field strategy of providing a strong value proposition of an extended construction management solution is taking hold with a high attach rate of team and field solutions on top of the core office technology. In addition, product innovation continues with drawing functionality recently released which increases the strength of the project management offering in the team solution. To anchor this momentum back to strategy, when we did both these deals, we framed that we saw competitive dynamics moving fast and that we could be spectator or participant. The last weeks and months of M&A activity in the space have validated this hypothesis and affirmed acquisition premiums. When we combine Trimble's field and constructible model workflows with Viewpoint's construction management software and e-Builder's strength in managing capital programs for owners, we believe we have the ingredients for a disruptive industry platform which can enable true construction project information transparency between owners, general contractors and trade contractors. We now have a construction business with over $1 billion in annual pro forma run rate revenue with more than 60% of that revenue being software related. Let's now close with guidance on slide 14. We are moving the company to a non-GAAP revenue guidance measurement. When we publish our third quarter actuals, we will also be updating our first and second quarter non-GAAP actual results to reflect this common measurement. This measurement will eliminate the noise associated with negative purchase accounting effects that are most pronounced with software acquisitions and will enable us to provide increased transparency to the underlying performance of the business. As mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, looking at our results for the first and second quarters, we remain favorably positioned in the market and as such we are raising guidance for the year. For the third quarter we expect non-GAAP revenue to be between $795 million to $825 million and EPS between $0.43 and $0.47 per share. For the year, we are raising guidance to $3.14 billion to $3.19 billion, up from previous levels of $3.12 billion to $3.17 billion and we are raising EPS to $1.81 to $1.89 per share, up from $1.72 to $1.82 per share. Three comments. First, the annual range does not include the anticipated benefits of non-GAAP revenue adjustments in the first and second quarters. Second, whereas foreign currency translation represented a tailwind to year-over-year revenue in the first half of the year, at current rates, we expect the second half of the year to have a minor negative impact to revenue which is reflected in our updated guidance. Currency translation does not materially impact our EPS guidance. Third, the Viewpoint impact. We expect to add a little under $50 million of non-GAAP revenue in each of the third and fourth quarters with operating margins in the 20% range. Including the incremental interest expense of $12 million to $13 million per quarter, we expect the net impact to be slightly dilutive to EPS in the short term. We believe we are on a path to achieve earnings accretion ahead of plan in 2019. Let's now take your questions.
Operator: We have your first question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Baird. Your line is open.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. Steve, could you perhaps address, or Rob; Rob, you had mentioned some of the competitive M&A in this construction space and some newer participants now having bought assets from private equity. But I'm curious, the one observation would be that if you look at the field-oriented software that Trimble brings to the table, it would seem a significant differentiator versus a lot of the M&A and the new participants who are either maybe seemingly heavy on the front or back end. Could you just maybe address the pace of M&A and maybe just reemphasize where Trimble sees its competitive position?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, let me answer initially kind of from the 30,000 foot level and then let me turn to Rob, to maybe refer more specifically kind of to the deal flow that we have seen over now the last nine months or so. So I think that from kind of an existential standpoint, Trimble's history is very much field centered in terms of, okay, that is where we really got our start, that's where our strength is, and our relative emphasis on domain knowledge really is in our view very central to this. This is not simply a matter of walking on to a construction site or into a contractors office and selling what's called a horizontal version of the world. It's very, very necessary to understand the intricacies of the construction workflow to really be able to solve some of these problems. So, I think that inherently we believe we have an advantage simply because we are fundamentally better aware of what goes on on the construction site than many of the others are now becoming involved. So I think that from a positioning standpoint and in terms of our field centricity if you, will we feel pretty comfortable. So without a doubt, I think that it's an attractive space. It's a large industry. The technology now enables solutions that were not necessarily possible five years ago. It is attracting a fair amount of attention, but in our view fundamentally we are advantaged from our relative historical positioning there. And the other element is that, if you will, giving a practical example, you know the combination of Viewpoint and our historical position in the machine in terms of machine control, it would be a huge advantage to a contractor to be able to turn on the ERP from Viewpoint or for that matter for anybody else, and see the outcomes from the morning's work in terms of the relative productivity of the bulldozer or the grater or the excavator or whatever and have that actually available in real time in the ERP. And if you look at the elements of that, I would say, Trimble is uniquely positioned to be able to provide that total solution, just as one example. Let me look to Rob to kind of comment on kind of the deal flow aspects of the last nine months.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well certainly, we've seen activity, an increased level of activity in the space. When we announced the Viewpoint acquisition, one of our talking points was there weren't many scaled assets in the construction technology space and over the last few weeks, there's even fewer out there, fewer out there now. So the active players, I think you know who they've been, between Fortive and Roper and, well probably those two in particular, and actually many of the I'd say the acquisitions that have taken place are potentially more complimentary to what we've done. So not even necessarily competitive.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I see, okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, within the Resources & Utility business, could you just sift through the ag exposure in North America and rest of world? Have you seen any knee-jerk reaction on spending in the U.S. relative to China's commentary around soybeans? Or is that still on the come or how should we think about the North America versus rest the world split in ag?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. I mean over the last few years, our business, our agriculture business has become much better diversified geographically as well actually as from a product mix perspective. So the majority of our agriculture business today is outside of the U.S. So we have a geographic diversity that's greater than what we had years ago. We're also more diversified, I'd say, on the machine versus off the machine. So from an on the machine perspective, we're historically known for guidance and our move has been more into the variable space. So there is diversification on the machine as well as off the machine as our software, agriculture software and the construction services business. So in terms of setting context, we basically have a quite a different portfolio than we did years ago. There is also something to keep in mind from the long-term fundamentals in agriculture to put in context of the let's say, the talk of the inactions of the moment. One would be a growing population and then the second would be farm consolidation and we do see farms continuing to consolidate and that actually tends to be a net positive for us where there is the association to the return on investment, the larger the farm. As it relates then to let's say the specific of the question, I'd sort of reference back to Steve's commentary, if the trade is going to let's say geographically arbitrage from one market to the other, you know it's our mandate to then go follow, follow that trade. And in this case Steve's example was Brazil in soy.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you very much and nice, very nice quarter.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: For this Q&A session we're allowing participants to have one question and a follow-up only. We have your next question comes from the line of Gal Munda of Berenberg. Your line is open.
Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is just in terms of the way you see now after the acquisition of Viewpoint. How can that integrate with the other software assets that you have and how high is that on priority list in terms of technological implementation? Would you think about integrating it with Vico potentially to get a full 5D bin solution and if there are plans to do that, what's the kind of the timeline you're thinking about it?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So, if I take the integration and I take it holistically between the existing Trimble business, Viewpoint and e-Builder. I would think – we think about it both opportunistically as well as strategically. From an opportunistic perspective, the first things we look at are where we have shared customers and many of the shared customers are coming to us with potential ideas or quick win product ideas and letting customers drive the integration that's going to make sense at a product level. Also opportunistically we happen to have let's say each business, as it were, having three user conferences coming up in the next few months. So there is a great deal of messaging that we're working on as it relates to talking to those customers and being in front of those customers gives us an opportunity to further talk about the product synergies that we see. From a strategic perspective and how we approach the integration, we start with segmentation, so segmentation of the customers. The Viewpoint example is a good one to reference back to the 8,000 customers that the business has. We have that split a third, a third, a third between general contractors, heavy civil contractors and specialty trade contractors, specifically MEP contractors. So, it's mapping at a segmentation level with the product offerings. And then going to your point, Gal, or your question about taking Vico as an example, fundamentally Vico is about enabling scheduling and that as a feature and to build that into the products on the industry platform that we talked about is certainly something that's top of mind for us. You know we have project management solutions in the respective businesses and one of the activities we have from a cost synergy perspective, which we also think will lead to revenue synergies, is to rationalize our efforts in project management so that we can be better focused. And in doing so, if we add let's call it the IP, the intellectual property from the Vico 5D scheduling aspect into the greater business in the portfolio, then we definitely would be bullish that there's opportunities for us. Because this really comes back to the idea of enabling this information transparency between owners, general contractors and the trade contractors.
Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned a bit of customer overlap. Can you talk a bit more between the e-Builder and between Viewpoint what the customer overlap is and what's the cross-selling opportunity between these two? I'd imagine that there might be some overlap but probably not significant in terms of.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Actually it would be a very small overlap, Gal. e-Builder focuses on owners, managing the capital programs for owners, whereas Viewpoint is managing the construction management system for the general contractors and the trade contractors. Where it makes a really nice fit is that the owner is ultimately working with a general contractor in order to build out the capital program. And so, the nature of the effort we would have in those two businesses is to make a more seamless connection of the data flow between the owner and general contractor. So, the example I have is one of the big general contractors who reached out to us very positively saying, okay, I am going to be able to integrate my data to get it to the owners better than I am able to do so today, so this is a great combination. So very little overlap. Actually really opportunity if you think about playing that out, taken if you're a general contractor working with an owner who is already in the e-Builder system, we believe that will give us a stronger value proposition to those contractors to be able to communicate better with the owners that they're serving today.
Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Perhaps you could share with us some more details on the actual integration planning and what's going on there. And how do you drive cross synergy sales? Do you have to integrate all the back office systems, all the ERP systems, or how do you actually generate revenue synergies from one group to the other? I'm just curious how that all happens behind the scenes.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So the first order priority for us I recall with the as-is (00:36:55) business is to continue the momentum in the business and not to distract the operators and the teams from what they're doing today. These are businesses that are growing double digit. You heard me refer to the strong double digit bookings growth in both of the businesses. So first order of business is not to upset the apple cart with the business that we have and to continue to enable them on the growth path that they're on. So this is an, I call it an and, not an or, so that's priority one. From more specifics at the integration level, think about it at a people level and then revenue synergies and cost synergies. At a people level, it's really as we get to know one another in the teams and reinforcing the cultures and reinforcing or I should say, ensuring that we keep the teams, keep them focused. And from a revenue synergy perspective, you look at the early sharing of the pipelines, the customer pipelines, where do we have the existing relationships. If you take an example in the Trimble world in our civil construction world, a Department of Transportation, a state Department of Transportation in the United States is an important let's say customer user of technology. We would want to use that door to be able to come in and talk about e-Builder, about how e-Builder is relevant to managing the capital programs in the civil construction space. So it's really finding the pipelines and getting the right people together to talk about that and some of those conversations have already been taking place. And like anything, start with what can be the lower hanging fruit to go after before making it too complicated and going through 10,000 customers. On the cost synergies specifically, so we have a team that's – we have a number of teams that are working on various aspects of the integration. But one of the teams is looking at cost savings opportunities. The first place we look would be in software licensing, hosting, IT infrastructure costs where we can create leverage through Trimble. At a, you asked about kind of at a systems level, we would look more at a CRM than an ERP. From a CRM perspective, that's where you're able to mine the customer, databases, and look for the opportunities. That's where we would look to make sure that we can communicate more seamlessly between the organizations. At the ERP or the actual transactional level, we'd be more cautious and look at that over time to see what's the right thing, see what the right thing is to do. So, does that help, Ann?
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. And I should have said CRM obviously. But is there a risk that you end up with a plethora of different systems that are tied together, or will you be forced at some point to consolidate CRM systems and invest significantly in IT?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Oh, I think that we would look to consolidate some of the system activities over time. And the really the more, I'll call them, customer centric, customer facing it is, that's going to be higher up on the priority list. Elevate to a Trimble company level, less than 2% of our revenue is invested in CapEx. So it's not a CapEx type investment that would, I'll call it, break a model. I think would actually be one about enabling a model and I think it is one that is relevant. In fact, not really even – and just within, while whether we're talking about Viewpoint or e-Builder, but across all the businesses we have in the construction technology space, I'd view that as an enabling technology to help us go after the market opportunity. The more it's the transactional side in the ERP system, there we would just I'd say kind of wait and see as to what's going to make sense. You have to look at the fact that we sell both hardware and software. We have business that goes through dealers. We have business that goes direct. And so I tend to not believe that there is such a thing as one ERP system that can do all of that.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. That's helpful. I just wanted to understand the strategy or the thought process particularly on the CRM side and how we manage all of these acquisitions when the integration happens down the road. So I appreciate that. I'll leave it there. I've taken enough time. Thanks.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Ann.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon and good evening.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wonder if you could talk about Müller organic growth performance. How has that been tracking this year and how effective have your cross-selling efforts been in terms of pushing the product through your core distribution?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So technically I wouldn't pull organic yet. It came into Trimble in July of last year. So, but of course we could look at how was the business performing before we acquired it and what does that look like.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, please.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: And that's a double digit increase. Actually pretty strong double digit increase in the business over that time. So the business is doing very well would be the punch line to the answer. And then in terms of where we look for the leverage points, I reference back to Steve's commentary. One of the nice let's call it fits between the Trimble agriculture business and the Müller business is, as Müller historically has been OEM centric and European centric, and Trimble with the global, I'll say global centric and aftermarket centric, so it's the opportunity therefore is to bring Müller into the Trimble aftermarket global dealer channel and for Trimble, for us to build access more OEMs. And I think both of those are bearing fruit at this point.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And can you just provide some more context on that last point, Rob? Any examples stand out and what could that mean for cross-selling opportunities as we enter 2019?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the OEMs themselves, so we're not able to disclose the OEMs. So I wish, it would be easier probably for this conversation if I could. But places like Brazil and really and elsewhere, we're seeing positive momentum there. In terms of where it could go on an ongoing basis, well that would be net new upside for us if we're able to create business out of it. So I would call it a favorable tailwind opportunity for us.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then for transportation, you folks have been looking for a real acceleration in terms of back office investment among the freight industry after the ELD investment over past couple of years. Is that playing out? Can you just give us a sense for what you're seeing in that part of the business year to date?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah so, Jerry, that one's played out a little different than the hypothesis we had coming into the year and appears to be maybe a quarter or two behind where we thought it would be. We have a number of, somewhat anecdotal, but a number of the trucking companies are so busy right now and I think you would know that and be able to see that from the data. And many of which are also facing driver shortages and we see that in the spot market rates on freight and the inventory levels. Where we've got, it basically turns into a number of companies that are too busy to go into bigger implementations at the moment. And so that's played out a little different than we thought. Having said that, the enterprise side of the business was up double digit year-over-year in the second quarter. But I would also say has been a little less than what we thought it would be at this point in the year.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Hey, good evening everybody. Mine is sort of a general question. You've built a really, really, interesting platform in digital construction. It's an area that's obviously hot right now. Others are acquiring and so forth. And I'm just curious as you've gotten a little bit closer look at e-Builder and Viewpoint, I mean do you see that you have years of acquisition activity ahead where you can fill in different niches and where acquisitions or innovations bubbling up and you're continuing to really, really start to build out? Or do you really feel like you've acquired the scope and platform that you need and you'll sort of see how you can drive revenues through internal?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, again. I'll make a general statement and there will be exceptions to it, but I think in general, as Rob pointed out is what's called the big game is effectively disappearing in terms of the assets that are available to acquire. There aren't that many left. There never were that many, and they're a diminishing breed at this point in time. So certainly nothing large, but I think what you're suggesting is kind of, let's call it, a wave of entrepreneurship and small companies that might be acquirable. I think that's actually a more relevant model for agriculture than for construction. Yeah there is innovation occurring in construction. There are startups. But I think that in general I would say in general, and I'm sure that there will be exceptions over time, but in general I would say is that we're now looking to internal development as the primary vehicle for progression going forward. Will there be potentially opportunities big and small, possibly. But I would say is that there, I think there is not let's call it a wave of small venture-backed companies that are likely to emerge. This is a scale business, which is kind of the point for doing both Viewpoint and e-Builder and I think it requires a certain amount of scale to be successful here. So, there may be some of that, but I would say by and large that we're going to focus on internal product development as really being the vehicle to take us forward. Possible exception to what I just said is maybe looking more globally, is that work does tend to be done differently around the world, so that if there's something that's going to drive acquisitions, as likely to be kind of international, filling in the gaps internationally more so than from a product standpoint.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to start out with some other commentary around the portfolio effects that you're seeing around your solution. Is there any way that you can maybe quantify for us like whether you're seeing more bundled sales or multi-product sales versus kind of standalone point solutions at this point?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So, I'd give you a couple. Hi, Jonathan. I'd give you a couple of examples and then I'll let you see where you want to go with the question or the follow up on it. In the construction, we'll start in construction technology. So we have the SketchUp business, as you know, which is an architectural and design software. We have a content business. So a 3D warehouse that feeds content, 3D content into the SketchUp product. Those two have a synergy between one another. The SketchUp product can also be sold with the Tekla Structure. So, if you were to move from a conceptual design into engineering level detail, you start out with the conceptual design, move into the engineering detail and you can move data from SketchUp to a Tekla Structures product. Our Trimble Connect, it's a solution, our platform. So Connect is the enabling technology to bring together the data and move the information flow across the ecosystem in construction. We have literally integrated elements of connect into SketchUp. So as you actually log in to SketchUp, you're coming through Connect and thereby having access to the file sharing which enables the data to move throughout the project, and this is coming in at the beginning of the project. And there is levels of product integration as well as solutions offerings. In terms of quantifying it let's say beyond that, I would actually characterize us as being in the early innings of really getting after the, and achieving the opportunity we have for the product bundling, the solution bundling. You know if you think about what's possible and literally possible, literally doable, like taking our field layout technology. That's the hardware and the software that's bringing that, connecting that physical and the digital world. That's the kind of solution bundles that we can already sell today and I think we're scratching the surface of what's possible for us. That's a very construction centric answer. You play it into the world of agriculture. If you look at the penetration of software we have relative to the hardware customers, we think we're penetrated maybe on it 10% to 15% of the acres that we, and software that we cover with hardware or the guidance and variable rate technologies today, that would be a real opportunity we see for ourselves. In the transportation space, and they're increasingly having solutions that intersect what we do from a routing, mapping, navigation software as well as the enterprise software and the mobility software. So actually we have our user, annual user conference in the transportation business, takes place in early September. This year it's now the largest transportation technology user conference in North America. And there will be product announcements that come out at that user conference where we're able to create new, I call them new, new solutions based on integrating the data that we have available from what's in the portfolio.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up, when you start looking at the transition from I guess traditional hardware and license solutions to maybe emphasizing more hardware as a service and subscription, what sort of timeframe are we looking at for that to happen and maybe what are the implications to growth in margins just given the revenue recognition shifts with that type of a move?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the software one, that would have probably at this point be more meaningful than taking hardware as a service, as a business model. If we look at software, we have well over $500 million of software in services today and that's mostly perpetual software. So if you look at that basket of revenue and think about that and a transition to subscription, here is a rule of thumb that we think about. If you were to move $100 million of that perpetual revenue to subscription revenue, by definition you'd create a headwind to growth and margins. And so think about that $100 million and think about that, call it, divide by 3 and think about that at a subscription pricing level, is rough math, but think about dividing that by 3 and then how does that $100 million that converts over, how does that impact the total company model. And that level of business converting that $100 million of perpetual would be approximately 1 percentage point to growth and 1 percentage point at the company level and 1 percentage point op margin at the company level. So by definition would have an impact to the operating leverage. That math was, we took that into consideration in the model we put forward at Investor Day. To the extent that math plays out, it would really be a function of let's say how fast we turn the dial on the movement on that basket of revenue.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Colin Rusch, your line is open. Colin Rusch, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I had a couple of just I guess housekeeping questions and then a broader question. But first, I just want to be sure that in the formulation of your guidance that we'd previously built in completely that Viewpoint and e-Builder acquisitions were already completely in. And then I guess more broadly, I mean you've kind of touched on it already with what you're looking at for transportation, et cetera, but what are we seeing from a buying habit or process standpoint? It came in below a little bit with what we had modeled and hardware sales were – are hardware, and so I guess I'm wondering, are hardware sales falling off some? Or is there a mix shift that's happening there that maybe isn't apparent to us? And if you could call out a little bit what's happening in that segment, we'd appreciate it. Thanks.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So, on the guidance question, are you asking if the guidance we made for the third quarter in the year includes e-Builder and Viewpoint?
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm actually asking if the previous guidance that you had given, if that had previously included Viewpoint and e-Builder?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: It had, yes, the guidance we gave at Investor Day on the year. Yes, it included Viewpoint and e-Builder.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Okay, I just want to confirm that.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Okay.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah and then my question on transportation.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Transportation, yeah sure. So, on the transportation business, actually the transportation business came in at about our expectations, so I'm not sure, obviously I'm not sure exactly how you modeled it out. In terms of how the let's say the mix played out in the business, for the last couple, well, it's the last two or three quarters now, we talked about the rate of growth that we would expect on a year-over-year basis given the surge in demand we had last year leading up to phase one of the two phases of the ELD mandate. So, that's actually been doing better than we expected so far this year, so the revenue has been ahead of where we expected. So from an overall I'd say level of business, that's been up. In terms of the mix shift, what we start to see and this would reflect in – okay, you don't see the gross margins. But what we saw in the gross margins in the transportation business is more of a shift to the subscription software kicking in and the hardware is a lower margin business at a gross margin level. And as the subscriptions kick in, that's at a higher gross margin. So we did see some mix in the revenue. That would, I would characterize as expected. So from my point of view, it came in about where we expected. Maybe a follow-up you'd want.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Yeah. No, that's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Sorry about the technical difficulties earlier, but this is Kristen on for Colin. Can you guys hear me?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Fabulous. So it's sort of a follow-up to a prior question but I was struck – Steve, one of the comments that you made about some of the cross-segment collaboration that really feels like a new conversation for Trimble. So I'm just wondering if you can provide some light on that and maybe where there are revenue opportunities across the segments and maybe even some R&D synergies. Just any color you can provide on that.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah I think it probably is a point of emphasis that has grown over the last five years. And I think maybe the most significant change in enabling the conversation has been that really the technology has advanced to the point within the last five years, so that Trimble 5 to 10 years ago was talking in a construction firm to the equipment manager and the equivalent to a corporate farmer. We were talking to a whole different level management. Because technology has become so central to these enterprises, the conversations we're having have been elevated to the C-level suite. So we're now talking to CEO, COO, CIO, that class of people, and both in agriculture and construction and in a different way maybe transportation. Technology has become strategic whereas 5 to 10 years ago it was kind of an add-on. Today it is a central consideration. So we are having conversations at a level of the company where they're looking for transformative effects on the enterprise. And therefore, for example my visit to Brazil, that was the core of every conversation in Brazil, which was not just about farming or specific aspects, how can you help me transform my entire enterprise. And I still find it amazing in terms of the points of relevancy for Trimble right across the enterprise, whether it be logistics, whether it be infrastructure, whether it be the point solutions in the operations. So I think that we're now having these conversations and I think they've been enabled by kind of access to the C-level suite and the transformation in the sorts of conversations we've been able to have. So I think we need to improve our capabilities for talking, having boardroom conversations. We need to pick up our game and be able to do a better job of account management which has been kind of a recurring theme fairly publicly over the last five years in terms of things we need to get done. But I would say it's really access, the centrality of technology to the strategy of these enterprises and the fact that Trimble has many touch points of relevancy to that really, really is the change.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Terri and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble's first quarter 2018 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Leyba, Director of Investor Relations.
Michael Leyba: Thanks Terri. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. I am here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. Turning to slide two of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide three for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, our guidance and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to slide four and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. The narrative for the first quarter is consistent in most ways with that of the fourth quarter and is notable for its strength across both businesses and regions. Reported revenue growth was over 20% with organic revenue growth continuing to track in double digits. Reported non-GAAP operating margins improved by more than a point versus the first quarter of last year and the improvement was even stronger after stronger after allowing for acquisition effects. We continue to operate with the most positive outlook we have had in over 10 years. Every segment and every significant region is growing and all are anticipated to continue to grow during 2018. We are also experiencing renewed higher growth in segments in which recent growth has been relatively modest, such as geospatial. We do remain observant of potential negative macro effects and volatility, most particularly in the realm of U.S. trade policy. While we are taking advantage of simultaneous vertical and regional market upswings, we continue to focus on and invest in the major multiyear secular trends that are specific to our markets. Our singular focus is on achieving leadership in the digitization of targeted mature industries and providing transformative benefits to those markets. We believe we have, in a number of cases, achieved a first-mover market position and are now at an opportune point in which the market is going through or about to go through an inflection point. In construction, we are leveraging two strong and unique Trimble attributes, our ability to connect the physical and digital worlds and our now reinforced ability to integrate data across the entire construction workflow. We believe our role in facilitating this integration in the industry is monetizable and provides us with a strong competitive position. In agriculture, we are leveraging our existing position as a provider of technology on more than 125 million acres. Our goal is to be a central participant in the worldwide adoption of data-driven variable rate applications. In transportation, our role is leading both evolutionary changes such as the adoption of video or electronic data logs and transformative changes such as providing the visibility necessary to create step function changes in the industry utilization rates. These transformative changes are taking place now and the contest for long-term market leadership is underway. We have evolved the view of the attributes that are necessary to maintain our leadership status during the market transition. The actual combination of the attributes will vary by market and by segment within those markets and there is a need to adapt strategy to specific circumstances. A few of the more universal attributes include a commitment to an open information architecture, holistic and complete solutions, not simply a cobbled together collection of point solutions and an ability to project worldwide. The e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions clearly represent our intention to shift the terms of competition and accelerate change in the construction market. Although these acquisitions are aggressive, they do not reflect a radical departure in strategy. In fact, the strategy we are executing today is a much evolved linear descendent of the version we deployed in 2000 when we acquired Spectra Precision. What has changed are the advances across a broad range of technologies that have enabled concepts that would have been merely fanciful in 2000. While stepping up strategically, we remain confident in our ability to continue to generate continuing improvements in the financial model. At the Viewpoint acquisition announcement, we identified our reasons for optimism on future financial performance, specifically that Trimble's core organic models producing both revenue growth and significant improvement in margins. The data suggest that both Viewpoint and e-Builder standalones are poised for accelerated growth. The combination of Trimble assets with Viewpoint and e-Builder are highly complementary, which opens up a significant opportunity for an exploitable immediate expansion in addressable market. Both Viewpoint and e-Builder bring mature management groups into the mix and strong traditions of cost discipline and accountability for the bottomline and the expectation of deleveraging the balance sheet in the next 12 to 24 months. Finally, our program to revisit smaller less strategic product lines is continuing to ensure our investment profile remains appropriate and to ensure that all businesses meet operating earnings thresholds. As a point of reference, the Trimble portfolio is generally more resilient than it was at the beginning of 2015, when we encountered the decline in agricultural, commodity and oil prices, less reliance on agriculture profitability and reflecting ongoing aggressive management of underperforming businesses. Trimble presents some challenges to instant understanding, particularly with the number of moving parts at the moment. Well, Rob will describe plans for an Investors Day on May 30. We look forward to that event as an opportunity to present a comprehensive and compelling case for Trimble's future leadership and growth. Let me now turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Painter: Thanks Steve and good afternoon everyone. I have four main topics today. First, a quick note on our implementation of the ASC 606 standard. Second, the numbers, a review of our first quarter actuals and our second quarter guidance. All P&L metrics today will be non-GAAP numbers. Third, I will provide some additional commentary on the e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions and finally a preview of our upcoming Investor Day. Starting with ASC 606. We retroactively restated our results for 2016 as a total year and 2017 by quarter, which we believe provides the best set of comparative data for our investors. We believe the changes were not material on a total company basis, but naturally there were some puts and takes. All year-over-year comparisons are now against restated 2017 numbers. Page five in the presentation provides color on the context of the change and page six shows that the impact of 2017 results were reduction in total year revenue by 0.003%, operating income dollars by 2% and non-GAAP EPS by $0.03. The detailed restated results are in the press release as well as on our Investor website. As for 2018 and the impact on our first quarter results under ASC 606 as compared to ASC 605, the impact was not material. Let's start on slide seven with a review of the first quarter results. Topline and bottomline results came in ahead of plan, meeting or significantly exceeding expectations in all reporting segments. First quarter total revenue was $742 million, up 22% year-over-year. Within that, currency translation added about 4% and acquisitions added about 6%. Organic growth was approximately 12%. First quarter gross margins were 56.9%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the underlying revenue mix. Operating income dollars increased 30% to $139 million with operating margin percentage increasing 120 basis points to 18.8%. On an organic basis, operating margins expanded year-over-year and were just under 20%. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined from 23% to 19% year-over-year, reflecting U.S. tax reform. We expect to see ongoing IRS guidance and accounting interpretations of the U.S. tax reform, which may impact our ongoing non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates in future quarters. Our net income was up about 35% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.44, up $0.11 or 33% year-over-year. Turning to slide eight. We finished the quarter with $274 million of cash and our gross debt level at the end of the first quarter was $1.12 billion with net debt of about $850 million. We repatriated about $350 million of cash in the first quarter. Going forward, we anticipate the continued repatriation of cash in order to support our deleveraging plan. On this slide, I would also note that deferred revenue increased 19% to $360 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $83 million, which was down year-over-year and requires a bit of color. Operating cash flow the quarter was impacted by incentive compensation payouts for 2017 performance that had been accrued in prior quarters and discrete M&A effects related to the e-Builder transaction. Excluding these effects, operating cash flow would have been over $120 million, which would represent approximately 1.1 times non-GAAP net income. In the second quarter, we expect strong operating cash flow and an excess of non-GAAP net income. Turning now to review the reporting segments. Let's start with transportation on slide nine. Revenue was up 19% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 2% and acquisitions adding about 2%. We continue to experience particular strength in our mobility business which offers fleet management solutions. While we have experienced tailwinds from the first wave of ELD regulations that went into effect in December of last year, we are more encouraged by competitive wins on significant customers that are providing demonstrable evidence of success of our competitive offering well beyond that of ELD compliance. It's worth noting that we have been in this business for almost 15 years and that we have established our leadership position by offering best-in-class solutions for fleets to manage their productivity, utilization and safety. The slide also provide a few other highlights including record bookings growth and field service management and addressable market expansion in our ALK business. Next, turning to resources and utilities on slide 10. Segment revenue was up 32% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 5% and the acquisitions providing a positive effect of about 23%. In agriculture, the business continued to grow, especially in markets outside the U.S. Our new GFX-750 guidance system is ahead of projected sales through the first quarter and has been well received by our distribution channel. Operating margins contracted 290 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 32.5%, impacted primarily by Müller and our NM Group acquisition. As we have previously articulated, we expect our acquisitions in this reporting segment to be modestly diluted at the segment level and we will work them to be accretive at the company level. To put this into context, this is our highest margin reporting segment, so this margin dynamic is perfectly natural. Percents are down and the dollars are up. Speaking of dollars, on the Müller acquisition, which we closed in July of last year, Müller's OEM business has been running ahead of our forecast and we are talking about the trajectory of our combined business. Strategically speaking, Müller will better position Trimble with OEMs and in the Europe market overall and Trimble will better position Müller in the aftermarket and in the North American market. Slide 10 also highlights a few other areas of success in this segment with significant customer wins in the forestry and utilities divisions as well as continued success with our correction services business, specifically the press release announcement of General Motors to provide correction services to their Super Cruise hands-free highway driving system. Moving to the geospatial segment on slide 11. Revenue was up about 17% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 3%. Organic revenue was up in the segment for the fifth quarter in a row and significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Our serving business continues to benefit from new product introductions and the health of end market applications such as construction and oil and gas. In April, we held a global dealer conference with several hundred partners for a review of the geospatial strategy and new surveying solutions coming to market for the upcoming northern hemisphere buying season. Sentiment in our channel is positive and strong. We also continued to experience strong sales of our inertial based technologies from our Applanix division to automotive companies for development of their autonomous technology programs. Operating margins in this segment were 21.4%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. Slide 11 also highlights a few other areas of success in the segment, such as new product launches for building monitoring and infrastructure monitoring. Turning now to the buildings and infrastructure reporting segment on slide 12. Segment revenue was up more than 20% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 5% and 5% from acquisitions in the quarter. The impact of growth in operating leverage enabled us to expand operating margins 240 basis points to 19.4%. Slide 12 also highlights a few other areas of success in our civil and building construction businesses such as the continued rollout of the Earthworks platform where innovation is driving demand in dozers and excavators. In our SketchUp business, which is migrating to a SaaS business model, our initial SketchUp free offering reach the milestone of having over one million monthly active users, just six months after launch. While we are on the buildings and infrastructure segment, let's talk a bit more about e-Builder and Viewpoint. In the last call, we discussed that e-Builder reported approximately $53 million of revenue in 2017 with over 20% year-over-year revenue growth and over 65% SaaS revenue. We also commented the because of purchase accounting effects from deferred revenue write-downs and incremental debt interest expense, we would expect $0.02 to $0.03 of EPS dilution in 2018. To put the purchase accounting effects in context, when we acquired e-Builder they had approximately $28 million in deferred revenue, which was required to be written down to approximately $12 million. The write-down means that there is a negative impact to revenue and operating income of $16 million which occurs mostly during the first year of the acquisition, which in combination with the estimated interest expense translates to the $0.02 to $0.03 negative EPS impact. This write-down has zero impact on cash flows. Excluding purchase accounting effects, e-Builder exceeded our top and bottom line deal model expectations in the first quarter. Our first quarter E-Builder operating income margin excluding the deferred revenue write-down was over 20%. The business also achieved double-digit growth in both recurring revenue and bookings. Let's move to commentary on Viewpoint. When we announced Viewpoint, we said we would soon be moving to a non-GAAP revenue measurement to adjust for these skewed purchase accounting effects. We believe this reporting convention will make this accounting dynamic a lot easier for our investors to understand and will provide a better representation of revenue and profitability of technology companies that we acquire. Since we announced our acquisition two weeks ago, we have received a great deal of positive feedback. We included two slides from our acquisition call and this material is on pages 13 and 14. When our existing construction business and Viewpoint our combined, Trimble will have a construction technology business that exceeds $1 billion in run rate revenue with the majority of that revenue being software related. I would like to take an opportunity to clarify two topics that have come up since the announcements. First, some reinforcement on what we said about the financial profile of the acquisition. In 2019, we said we expect more than $200 million in revenue, operating cash flow greater than $50 million and operating margins greater than 20%. Including estimated interest expense, we said that the acquisition would be accretive to operating cash flow in 2019 and slightly dilutive to EPS in 2019 and then accretive to EPS in 2020. At this point, we anticipate four to six quarters maximum of EPS dilution which, to be clear, is driven by the incremental interest expense associated with the acquisition. The underlying business will be producing strong operating income and cash flow yields above that. We believe that we have the underlying business model and underlines booking growth to grow into EPS accretion and we hope to over deliver against hose expectations. To put some data behind this, bookings at Viewpoint have been accelerating. First quarter 2018 SaaS bookings were up over 125% year-over-year and the momentum has continued into the beginning of the second quarter. The acceleration of model conversion from perpetual to subscription also continues with two-thirds of new bookings, year-to-date, representing subscription bookings. The second topic has to do with our approach to integrating workflows across our portfolios. To quote Steve, a set of holistic and complete solutions not simply a cobbling together of point solutions. To give you an example, let's talk about Trimble Connect, for which I would like to ask you turn to slide 15. Connect is our cloud interoperability backbone. We have over one million authenticated users on Trimble Connect. In Trimble Connect alone, we have over 60 solutions and workflows currently integrated with the Connect platform. Now take e-Builder and Viewpoint and we see a path to connect owner workflows all the way through the general contractor and onto the self performing contractors and their field workflows. And with Viewpoint, we see an ability to connect contractors to owners as well as to connect Trimble workflows into the contract's cost and resources that Viewpoint manages today. Our unique differentiation here happens at the intersection of the digital and physical worlds where we are connecting constructible model workflows to Connect stakeholders across the construction lifecycle. We will have more to come on this at Investor Day. Next, slide 16 with revenue mix by geography. Rest of world shows down. That was from the Middle East and South Africa. Brazil, for example, was up over 25% year-over-year. North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific were all up nicely. Moving to slide 17. Software services and recurring revenue streams grew over $160 million on a trailing 12 month basis and represent about 47% of company revenue. Recurring revenue grew about $90 million and represents 28% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. Let's now move to second quarter guidance and go to slide 18. We expect our second quarter revenue to be between $755 million and $785 million and non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.42 and $0.46 per share. Please note that our guidance does not incorporate the new planned non-GAAP revenue measurement. Three comments on second quarter guidance. First, with respect to topline growth, the midpoint of the range implies more than 16% year-over-year revenue growth, of which approximately $40 million or 6% is from acquisitions and between 2% and 3% from currency translation. Second, in terms of profitability, the midpoint of our guidance assumes a second quarter non-GAAP operating margin between 18% and 19%. To break that down, we expect organic operating margins to be above 19%, offset by margin dilution from recent acquisitions. Third, below the operating margin line, we expect the equity income at approximately $9 million. Furthermore, it is also important to get the modeling correct on interest expense, which will step up in the second quarter as a result of our increased leverage which will of course then step up again in the second half of the year after we close the Viewpoint transaction. We expect second quarter interest expense of approximately $13 million. Last, a few comments on our second half of 2018 outlook. After our fourth quarter call, we said our expectations for fiscal year 2018 were for low to mid-teens annual revenue growth for the year with high single-digit organic growth rate and greater than 25% operating leverage. With the acquisition of Viewpoint, assuming the deal closes at the start of the third quarter, that will add a little under $50 million of non-GAAP revenue in each of the third and fourth quarters. Including Viewpoint, revenue growth in the second half of the year is expected to be in the high-teens. We also expect total year operating margins to improve more than a point. Please note that including the Viewpoint acquisition total interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million to $25 million per quarter in the third and fourth quarters. Before we go to Q&A, let's us discuss our Investor Day which we will be hosting at our Westminster, Colorado campus on May 30. For those of you who cannot attend the events in person, it will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. Slide 19 has more details. We aim to hit a number of themes to address our continued financial performance, including our long-term growth outlook, our ongoing transition to software and subscription and our margin expansion outlook. We will also be at the upcoming JPMorgan Technology, Media and Communications Conference in Boston in May and the NASDAQ Investor Program and Berenberg Conference in London in June. With that, let's now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Hi. Good afternoon everyone.
Steve Berglund: Hi Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I am wondering if you could talk about the business model for providing positioning services to automotive application? How should we think about revenue per unit? Presumably, it's a service revenue, but maybe you could frame for us the opportunities ahead and what the competitive landscape looks like?
Steve Berglund: So the correction services business is within the resources and utilities segment. And I think we have previously referenced that as crown jewel of the business at Trimble. The role of correction services today, if you look at the customer base, it primarily services the agriculture market. Secondarily, it serves the construction market. And then the third is this emergence of an automotive market. In the context of agriculture or construction, centimeters matter. In order to achieve centimeters, ubiquitously and at a fast convergence time, you actually have to subscribe to what we call these correction services and there's essentially a menu of options available for the accuracy and conversion time. Taken into the context of automotive, the context really is one of that of sensor fusion and it's the role, I would say, of absolute position because that is what the correction services are providing is absolute positioning. Now it is providing that by augmenting into the satellites with some known ground-based points, which improves the geometry plus the mathematics to correct for errors in the atmosphere to improve the accuracy of the position that's given. It is a subscription. So it's a SaaS-like business that technically a subscription business. And from a monetization standpoint and an automotive context, but really actually in all context, it's a monthly subscription. And in terms of sizing, let's say, the opportunity, certainly today the automotive slice is a very small slice of that business and it remains to be seen but we have a level optimism about the role of absolute position and how that will augment in the sense of sensor fusion with imagery and a relative position that you can get today.
Jerry Revich: Good. So thank you for the color. And then in resources and utilities, your organic growth looks like slowed this quarter compared to the run rate exiting 2017. Can you just talk about the moving pieces in terms of how organic growth played out in the quarter by region or by product line just to give us some more context on the drivers this quarter?
Steve Berglund: Sure. So the agriculture business is the largest aspect of the resources and utilities segment. The growth we have been seeing continues to be faster outside the U.S. than in the U.S. So that's the 30% plus I referenced in Brazil is predominantly driven by the agriculture business, continue to see growth in Europe and as well as Asia-Pacific in the agriculture business. The U.S. market was up slightly. It continues the pattern that we have we have seen of late. Within the segment, we also have that correction services business and that was up high single digits in the quarter. So it really came in pretty much exactly as we expected, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes form the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann Duignan: Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. It's Ann Duignan.
Steve Berglund: Hi Ann.
Ann Duignan: Maybe I am just new to the story, having this ticker covered yesterday. So forgive me if this is a question that doesn't need to be asking on the call. But when you talk about operating margins up driven by volume, gross margin expansion and operating leverage, can you expand a little bit more on the gross margin expansion and the operating leverage piece? Because in my mind, those would and also be driven by volume. So what's different between volume, gross margin expansion and operating leverage?
Rob Painter: The gross margin is reflective of the revenue mix. So you all can think of it as product mix. At a total company level, it is can be a little hard to dissect a gross margin, because of the different dynamics within the reporting segments. So if you look at the revenue breakdown, almost half software, half hardware. There is different dynamics at play. But the overall gross margins were up reflecting the underlying businesses, which is irrespective of the revenue growth or largely irrespective of the revenue growth. And then the operating leverage specifically is referring to, in this case, it's the sum of that gross margin improvement as well as cost management. And when we look at the operating leverage, we will look both at, of course, the total operating leverage that we are delivering as well as the operating leverage on the organic revenue from the business because the dynamic that we see play out within operating leverage is the acquisitions. As they come I, they tend to be dilutive to the operating leverage. And so the operating leverage at the total company level is therefore lower. And that organic operating leverage met our expectations of above 30%.
Ann Duignan: Okay. So by segment, gross margin expansion is more as mix comment and operating leverage is organic operating leverage?
Rob Painter: Yes.
Ann Duignan: Okay. That's helpful to understand that. And then just a couple of follow-up questions on Viewpoint. Bain Capital paid $230 million for a majority stake in that asset in 2014. Can you help us understand what was the majority stake? I mean how much of Viewpoint did it own? And then post the acquisition your leverage, what's your goal in terms of how much of your debt will be fixed versus variable?
Rob Painter: I will take the first part of the question. After being acquired Viewpoint, the majority of Viewpoint. There had been a long time owner, founder-owner and then Bain Capital came in made an investment and then took over the rest of the investment in 2014. And then after that, they also did a couple of acquisitions. So to the extent you are trying to look at a purchase price, you will end up with an incomplete analysis, if you are trying to compare that to the Trimble purchase price because quite a bit happened between 2014 and 2018. Ann, repeat the second question please?
Ann Duignan: Just your mix of debt post Viewpoint, how much would you expect to have fixed versus variable?
Rob Painter: Well, I would say, at this point, we have the syndication or the bridge commitments from the financial institutions and that mix will sort itself out here, I would say, soon enough as we go to capital markets to take out the bridge and put in the permanent financing.
Ann Duignan: Do you have a targeted as CFO of how far you will be comfortable with being variable in this environment of rising interest rates?
Rob Painter: Well, we would look for it, honestly when you look for a mix of different tranches of debt in terms of maturity times and rates, but it's a bit premature for me to nail down before we actually go out to the debt markets.
Ann Duignan: Okay. I appreciate the color. I will get back in line. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman: Hi. Good afternoon. Rob, could you talk for a minute or two on the buildings and infrastructure piece of the business? The core growth was just under 11%. I am curious could you maybe give a little color on BIM business versus civil construction business? And if there is any discernible trend difference between the two businesses going forward?
Rob Painter: Actually, I would say there is not a particularly discernible difference. They both performed well in the in the first quarter. I think the civil business is a little bit ahead of the BIM business. The dynamics are quite probably different. So there is a few different dynamics in both of those. What's common of course is the digitization of the markets or digitization of construction. The civil engineering business today is more hardware centric and the BIM business is more software centric. We are working with civil contractors primarily and engineers in the civil engineering business and a mix of designers, engineers, contractors, especially contractors and owners in the BIM business. So some different stakeholders, but the macro theme of the digitization is the same and really the macro theme at a secular level applies to both of businesses. I would say also the other dynamic that's pretty similar is the new product introduction and the impact on the respective businesses. So for instance, the Earthworks platform in the civil engineering business continues to be a real catalyst of growth as it enables us to do many things, but one of which is to reach the excavator market and which was previously largely an untapped market. And so it's increasing essentially the addressable market of what is highest machine count in the world. And so that's one of the drivers in the civil engineering business.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. When I look at the resource and utility business, maybe just a question around, have you seen anything domestically? Have you seen any buying patterns change? Or just shift relative to the dialogue that's going on in the protection side or the trade side? And then just the discussion can sometimes shutdown spending in the ag economy. And I am just curious, have you seen anything there because I am a little bit surprised, you addressed the slight growth in North America as on plan and I might have thought maybe that would been a little bit stronger here?
Steve Berglund: Well, Richard, I think the net answer for us kind of operating in the realm that we operate in, no, I don't think have seen any real impact on us in terms of the trade policy to-ing and fro-ing. I would say though that you historically taking the long view on the agriculture market, there is definitely kind of a headline factor that is involved in farmer buying patterns that you can not headline. So I would say is, in general, at this point in time people are waiting to see what might happen. But I would say at this point in time and probably for until something real does happen, people are not taking anticipatory source of actions at this point. So I think steady as she goes in that sense. And what we are seeing in our demand levels, I think, is the real market without a whole lot of speculative factor going into it.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Does that business, does the resource and utility business for the full year, is that maybe best thought of as a high single digit growth? Can it possibly get to 10% or mid-single? I am just curious because the starting spot seems a little bit lower than maybe I would have thought for the full year. Just curious how you view that segment?
Steve Berglund: I would view the segment in the mid to high single, Rick.
Richard Eastman: Okay.
Steve Berglund: I think we see enough, while the majority of the business is outside the U.S. today, the U.S. market itself, I think, is not poised for double digit with commodity prices where they are. And so in corn at the moment, even while we are seeing some replacement cycle of machines, I think it's not enough to the catalyze to double digit.
Richard Eastman: Got you. Okay. Thank you again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. As you guys see the growth of your asset management offerings, especially in a couple of big segments like buildings and infrastructure and then on the utility side, how are you seeing that really change your customer relationships as well as your product development roadmaps? I would love just kind of understand what that cycle starts to look like?
Steve Berglund: So to make sure I understood you, Colin, you are saying, given the nature of how the business is evolving, how our relationship is changing with customers along the way?
Colin Rusch: Yes. And integrating that with some comments around your product roadmaps and development process.
Steve Berglund: Okay. Well, from a customer segmentation standpoint, we could really apply this to almost any one of our businesses, but take it at a company level. If you do a segmentation of small, medium, large, enterprise type accounts, we can map our various businesses and on this case, I am taking it by customer size. The more you go up into enterprise level customers, so this could be the largest of contractors around the world or largest of transportation companies or the largest projects happening around the world. They tend to have a different, I will say, purchasing dynamic or relationship dynamic where they especially want to make sure they are working with Trimble and they have more single points of contact or at least a fewer points of contact. And so that's one area where we see those relationships changing. Another one and it kind of correlates to that upper end of the pyramid is professional services. So we do have some professional services capabilities at the company. And in the construction world, they tend to get deployed on these largest of projects who are really trying to figure out how to integrate all the various technologies that are available on, in this case, a construction site. And so that in itself is a very different way of engaging with a customer as a trusted advisors to how to optimize their processes and their use of technology in order to improve project delivery. And then backing into how all of the above, I would say, intersects with the product roadmaps. As you would imagine, we have customer councils, advisory councils and really in almost all of our businesses. And so it provides us an opportunity to stay close to the customers and to have a good set of advisors in that respect. And then all that meets technology. Of course, when you are in more of a software world or you are in a SaaS world, your ability to innovate can be measured in hours. And so you know where your working on a mentality of the fast fail or a minimum viable product, that's one of the specially nice things to have in a software rich business model. The pace at which you can test the development that you are doing and see what's working. So I hope that gives you a little color, Colin.
Colin Rusch: Yes. That's helpful. I will take a couple of follow-ups offline. And then the other quick question is around CapEx spending. That's up pretty significantly year-over-year. How should we think about that as we go through the balance of the year?
Rob Painter: Well, from a total company perspective, we would love to be below 2% of revenue on CapEx and that's consistent with I usually talk about when I am talking about the company model. And then one of the biggest specific areas of spend within that CapEx is, we are building a new building, a campus that we own in Colorado and I talked about that one, I don't know if was one or two calls ago and that's where we are using 50 different Trimble technologies to help us build that building better, faster, safer, cheaper.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks so much guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the lien of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to start with maybe the Viewpoint and e-Builder acquisitions. You have talked about scale being an increasing differentiator in this space. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color into how to think about those market dynamics going forward?
Steve Berglund: Well, let me take a crack and maybe Rob can embellish. But I think there are maybe two considerations. One is scope and the other is scale. I think scope, as I would use it, would be kind of the breath of offering in terms of kind of what I have been referring to as the holistic solution. And the other is a matter scale, which is relative to size and kind of the ability to project. I think both are becoming increasingly relevant. So for example, scope. I think our view would be, the small to medium size general contractors really do prefer a one-stop shopping sort of solutions. So therefore scope in the sense of bringing kind of a full product range to bear and kind of being that one-stop is going to appeal to that particular segment. Whereas in terms of large general contractors or perhaps owners, large owners, there they have relative of relative degree of sophistication and kind of the one-stop shop is less preeminent there. But at the same time, the ability to deliver at scale becomes more important, just to have the capability of providing a solution in large projects becomes important. So I would say the two considerations are both scope, breadth as well as scale which is relative ability to project yourself into a situation. And scale is increasingly meaning things like professional services. Rob mentioned professional services, but it's the ability to be an effective hand-holder in a project context and really be able to deliver the goods in a changing environment. So I think that both are becoming more important, depending on kind of market context. But yes and I think both the Viewpoint and e-Builder certainly provide additional scope in terms of being more persuasive, in terms of the capabilities across the cross the continuum. But then I think that in terms of credibility with large contractors or large owners is, Rob mentioned that Trimble now has or is about to have $1 billion in relative revenue a year in construction technology, which would certainly makes us credible from the ability to be able to deliver. So yes, hopefully that's on point to your question, but that's the way I would see it.
Jonathan Ho: Yes. And just maybe taking a look at the geospatial division. This looked like it was a very strong quarter and maybe a continuation on the organic side. How should we think about that on a go forward basis? Is this sustainable? Is this mainly driven by the SX10 product success? Can you just maybe give us some color in terms of how to think about that?
Rob Painter: Yes. On a longer-term basis, I tend to characterize the geospatial segment as within the four segments as being the lower growth business. So it would tend to characterize the other three reporting segments as mid to high single digits and the geospatial business somewhere in the mid and clearly we are above the mid at the at the moment in really these last the three quarters or so. And so if I break it down on what is and what could make catalyze that to be greater than the mid single digits. So I tend to characterize it, it would be as follows. One would be the new product introductions. And the answer is yes to the SX10. It continues to be a very effective product for us. This combination of the scanner and a total station is new, new territory and we haven't seen anyone be able to match that product. And so it's getting a lot of positive press and a lot of positive use in the market. And so we would expect to see continued demand for that product. Now that's far from the only thing we do in geospatial. The other new product I would mention is the line of total stations or mechanical total stations, which we believe will position us well in the emerging markets better than we had been positioned before with that same product line. So we are able to get new feature and functionality at a lower cost and price point and that's the essence of it. So we think that technology expands a market that we can reach. And more to come in that group. So new product introduction. It's a market that's driven largely by replacement cycles. So it's acceleration or velocity in our own technology is what will drive and catalyze growth in the segment. The other parts that has been strongly growing here for really the last couple of years is that of the Applanix business, which is largely based on a set of inertial technologies and what's really been driving that has been the autonomous car programs. And that would seem to be a market that has legs to it. The slope of it, the first quarter surprised us actually just how strong that came in. We would expect that to level out a bit here in Q2 and smooth out over, call it, a trailing 12 type basis. I think it would fit the profile that in an economy that's healthy with construction and with oil and gas close to about $70 the other day, that would lead us to think that there is some positive momentum to come in that business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Frankiewicz with Berenberg Capital.
Alexander Frankiewicz: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a quick question on, at the group level, what are your expectations for growth this year from software and from hardware? If you could just split those out for me?
Rob Painter: So I would make a good advertisement for our Investor Day coming up in a few weeks. So at the Investor Day, we will go into more detail at the product level. What I would give you a high level is that if we sort of put on the rearview mirror over the last couple years, we have been seeing the software outgrow the hardware by a pretty good clip. I think 1.5:1 over the last two, two-and-a-half years. What we saw in the last, I would say, three quarters or so is that the hardware was actually growing about as fast or actually as fast as the software part of the portfolio. And that's reflected a strength in end markets such as the civil construction market and the ag market outside the U.S. So actually a actually really good dynamic to have as far as percentages go because of course, it's the dollars you take to the bank. So on a longer-term basis, as you might imagine, we would expect the software growth to outpace the hardware. And when we come to Investor Day, then we will break it down with some are specificity by the business segments as well.
Alexander Frankiewicz: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then also on the transportation segment, what, in rough percentages again, of that is attributable to the ELD mandate? And then also on that, what kind of penetration are you seeing with ELDs amongst those who have to switch over? And how much longer do you expect that tailwind to last?
Rob Painter: Well, there's no question that ELD has been a tailwind for growth in the transportation business going on a couple of years now. If I were to size of the part of the business that's our mobility part of the business which does or largely delivers the ELD solutions and that's actually it's less than, well call that about, looking at my numbers real quick, yes, that's about half of the reporting segment that's within the PeopleNet business. But then even within the PeopleNet business, it's just a slice of the PeopleNet business. So it's a, let's call it, 20%, 25% of the business, I could say over the couple of years could probably trace something to the ELD mandate in terms of driving growth. And we are certainly seeing that in the hardware growth that's come out of that business in that they sell the hardware front and then it turns into subscription thereafter. And so, the cumulative subscriber base is growing in that business. The commentary or the narrative we have had is a very consistent narrative we have around this business is that, this just was never a cliff event where the ELD actually first phase of it went into effect in December of last year. And I think that was the question I got asked more than anything. In the second half of last year is what happens after that? I think the worry being that there would be a cliff. And we talked about a slope down in demand, but not a not a cliff because for a number of reasons. One, there is a whole series of other technologies we provide in the space. And by the way, ELD could just b e bare minimum compliance while our real differentiation happens at management of an entire fleet and optimization of a fleet and video intelligence solutions and we have end markets that we serve that are outside of the Class 8 vehicles, but also in markets such as energy or in food service. So a number other market adjacencies, number of other technologies that we have. And then again as you come out of that compliance, for us it's also an opportunity to upsell customers into a more complete solution. And all the while, while that's happening we have been experiencing or achieving significant wins, competitive wins for the full stack service solutions. So continue to be optimistic about the business, feel very good about our competitive position in that business. And as it relates to the penetration, one thing to keep in mind is this ELD mandate has two phases. And the second phase goes into full effect in December of 2019. So that's why we never saw a cliff. We would see a slope of the new unit demand. I would say, most fleets at this point of the larger fleets are reasonably penetrated with the technology and many of them are converting the first wave now into the, well actually I would say what will start to happen maybe at the end of this year, beginning next year is people convert to what's called AOBRD compliant devices over the full ELD compliant devices.
Alexander Frankiewicz: Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. On the ELD subs, what kind of churn are you seeing?
Rob Painter: Well, we don't disclose churn in this business. It's an inherently more complicated number or answer than what a simple number can provide. The first part of the mandate just went into effect. So there is very little churn that we would see on just ELD. Otherwise that would not be what we expect this soon after the first part of the mandate went into effect.
Alexander Frankiewicz: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
Yuuji Anderson: It's Yuuji Anderson, on for James. Thanks for taking my question. I also have a follow-up on transportation. You so all-in, can you speak a little bit to the mix you are seeing there between hardware and software there? Now that we are one quarter past the first phase of the mandate, is it fair to say that we should see substantially more software mix this year? And if so, does that kind of set up for faster operating margin expansion throughout the year?
Rob Painter: Well, it's certainly been our narrative that as we move into a higher mix of software that we should exceed commensurate operating margin expansion in the segment. There's two segments that I would say particularly outperformed in the first quarter. And one of them was transportation. And really I think that Q1, I would probably proved with an exclamation point that this wasn't all about ELD, because it was a very strong quarter of demand in that business, which meant that it came with a lot of hardware in the quarter. So by the pure percentages of the math, I would expect that that might actually temper the percentages but improve the dollars for the overall year. So having said that, we do expect a positive trend in the transportation business as we enter, it's really in the second half of the year more so than the first half of year. So as it's the second half of the year is where I would expect to see the margin expansion, some of which is natural by the way in the fourth quarter. So you could look at the last couple of years and you could see that that's a dynamic that happens in the fourth quarter. But a step up in that, I will just characterize overall second half of the year combine that third and fourth quarter and you would see that playing out.
Yuuji Anderson: Okay. Got it. Thanks so much for that. And then just quickly on Europe. So it was up 38% year-over-year. I assume a lot of that had to do with Müller. But I was curious to hear a little bit more in terms of what you are seeing there between the various end markets?
Steve Berglund: So I would say, yes. Müller is based in Germany and the majority of their business is in Europe today. So that from an overall growth perspective, that was the main driver. To speak more specifically, let's say, out of or I guess I should in addition to Müller, we continue to see even if that Müller side, Germany has been good, the U.K. actually was a good quarter for us, Italy, France, Austria, Netherlands, Nordics were strong. So pretty broad-based, Yuuji.
Yuuji Anderson: Got it. Thanks so much.
Steve Berglund: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Michael Leyba for closing remarks.
Michael Leyba: Thank you Terri and thank you everyone for attending today's call. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for participating. That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Justy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Trimble’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Michael Leyba, you may begin your conference.
Michael Leyba: Thanks, Justy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I’m here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today’s call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast, and we will be referring to the presentation today. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the Company’s Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today’s call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter and the year; after that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, the year and our guidance; and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Today I will let Rob provide the bulk of the narrative on the fourth quarter, as well as the commentary on tax reform and 606 effects. I will focus on interpreting the total year, the trends that are taking us into 2018, and our current strategic assessment with an emphasis on last week’s announcement of the acquisition of e-Builder.  We left the year having now delivered seven consecutive quarters of accelerating growth, although we overdelivered for the full year against our own original expectations, the results were consistent with the profile we anticipated at the beginning of 2017. That expectation was bifurcated with the first half of the year expected to demonstrate steady progression and the second half demonstrating a meaningful step-up in performance. In reality, that was what happened. Reported revenue in the first half grew at a rate of 7% and in the second half at a rate of 18%. Excluding acquisition, divestiture and exchange rate effects, the growth was approximately 8% in the first half and 12% in the second half.  The second half of 2017 provides us with the most positive platform we have had in over ten years as we enter 2018. Every segment and every significant region grew during 2017 and all are anticipated to continue to grow into 2018. Although there is always the potential for significant negatives to cast acts perhaps most notably in U.S. trade policy there is also the possibility of significant positive surprises such as the U.S. Infrastructure bill. Overall, we currently expect the second half of 2017 to provide the template for 2018 performance. In addition to the underlying support provided by the general macroeconomic environment, we are optimistic about strong multi-year secular trends that are specific to our markets. If these market trends are augmented in turn by our own targeted steps that enable us to capture and add bench position in these markets.  2017, where we were able to step-up these initiatives at the same time we were continuing to improve operational results. We anticipate maintaining the same balance of aggressive strategic initiatives, an improving financial performance into 2018. This intensified strategic focus is not a departure in a new direction, but more of a doubling down on our historical trajectory.  Tremble has throughout its history always been at the forefront of the digitization of mature industries. The speed of digitization has recently stepped up as a result of access to new enabling technologies including increased bandwidth availability, cloud ubiquity, and sensor proliferation. Trimble is positioned both because of its history and its innovation to provide a unique contribution through the digital transportation of the vertical markets we address. Let me describe four characteristics that make us unique. First, we have chosen not to be constrained to simply providing individual point solutions. Instead, our emphasis has been on utilizing technology to integrate the individual elements of traditional workflows into more comprehensive solutions.  By holistically emerging – engaging the workflows, we can eliminate many of the historical points of process friction that destroy productivity and add cost. This creates network effect benefits and promotes strong C suite engagement with owners and contractors.  Second, our historical strengthened field and mobile applications has been augmented by growing enterprise-level capabilities. This has eliminated the historical distinction between field and back-office and enables seamless real-time enterprise-wide decision-making and actions.  Third, we are equally comfortable in both the hardware and software universes. We are therefore well-positioned to craft elegant solutions that connect the physical and digital worlds. With the sensors informing a digital model, which then interprets the data and guides physical operations on machines and tools.  Fourth, at Trimble’s core is the belief that value is maximized by closely integrating deep domain knowledge with technological innovation. While the majority of the functionality we bring to the vertical markets maybe based on common product platforms, we have always recognized the challenges specific to each vertical market and extend our solutions beyond a generic one size fits all definition. These underlying cross-company characteristics provide the foundation for value-creation in our markets. Although they are applicable across the company, I will focus on mapping them on to our largest markets construction agriculture and transportation.  Construction is a multi-trillion dollar market, which is undergoing a productivity revolution. Trimble participates in both the horizontal infrastructure-centric construction market, as well as the vertical construction market which is more focused on buildings and structures.  We have the opportunity to play a key role in the unfolding construction revolution by providing tangible benefits across the entire design build operate workflow through the application of a conceptual framework we call the constructible model. Let me recite some of these benefits. The most visible example of the impact of technology on the construction side is the use of precise positioning technology to improve task productivity, typically, by automating machine operations or labor-intensive tasks such as layout. These point solutions represented the first wave of technology exploitation on the construction side and date back decades. Although the technology has long historical roots, it is not yet close to mature. In 2017, Trimble released the latest generation of machine control automation which represents another step towards complete machine autonomy. The application of technology and construction is also enabling the disintermediation and revamp of traditional work processes. For example, BIM and improved project management capabilities enable the offsite fabrication of structural elements which are then delivered to the construction site just in time for assembly. This example is consistent with an overall technology enabled trend that is allowing the construction site to increasingly take on the characteristics of factory floor.  Technology is also enabling an attack on the largest and perhaps least visible source of waste in construction which is rework. Rework is caused by factors such as imperfect design, poor collaboration, ambiguous or unaligned information and inadequate discipline in executing to a design.  New tools which integrate and align a digital concept to perfection with physical work operations can now highlight and prevent the causes of rework in the course of a project. Although the concept of the enterprise has meaning within the construction industry, the conceptual hard of the industry is really more about project delivery. Success or failure in the industry is determined by the ability to manage the elements of the project to achieve on-time schedules, on-budget cost and quality expectations.  The achievement of break out results which would be the reduction of project cost by over 20% from historical standards requires a holistic solution that integrates all the interdependent elements of the project.  To illustrate the interdependencies, let me use a simple example. A crew installing HVAC deck may achieve dramatic productivity improvements of more than 50% on that task through the use of smart layout tools. Although the result is impressive, the standalone point solution benefit will be completely lost if that same crew cannot access the space for its next operation, because the plumbing crew is already operating in that physical space and if the HVAC crew is required to wait for to be vacated resulting in non-productive downtime.  Emerging project management tools are increasingly able to recognize these interdependencies and squeeze out additional productivity. Bringing together these holistic answers is the Trimble’s strategic focus in construction.  Agriculture is also undergoing a transformative set of changes. Just as in construction, precise positioning has enabled transformative innovation in agriculture. The earliest application was machine guidance, which has enabled lower input cost, improved yields, and higher labor and machine utilization.  The next ways of innovation build on this foundation and lead in two different directions. One in the direction of machine autonomy and the other towards variable rate applications. Trimble is positioned to play a future leading role in both. The march towards full autonomy will be incremental and will take the form of ever increasing levels of automation. The concept of variable rate is about developing an optimized prescription for the field and the crop that maximizes yield with minimum input and then to efficiently apply that prescription in the field. Both autonomy and variable rate requires sophisticated solutions that incorporate data collection, analytics, decision-making software intelligence and hardware performance. Many of the Trimble advantages in construction apply as well in agriculture.  Our holistic view of the workflow, our integration of the field and enterprise, our comfort in both the digital and physical worlds and our domain understanding make us a unique contributor.  Trimble’s strategic focus in agriculture has been to augment our historically strong guidance focus, which positions us well in the pursuit of autonomy with the additional elements required to be a central presence in variable rate.  Transportation shares many of the same themes as construction and agriculture. It breaks down relatively clearly into two elements. One is managing a mobile asset, the truck and the second is managing the enterprise, which incorporates the business processes. Trimble is unique in this transportation industry and having a strong position in both elements, the mobile operations through our PeopleNet business and the enterprise through TMW and ALK. Since the acquisition of PeopleNet and TMW, we have successfully aligned the solution sets to provide transportation companies with the choice of complete workflow of functionality. Our strategic focus in transportation is to continue to build out the functionality of the comprehensive solution to expand internationally to play a first mover role in the implementation of both block chain and the cloud and to solve the remaining breakout operational challenges in the industry.  One of the remaining core breakout challenges in transportation is that of relatively low capacity utilization. We are addressing that by providing improved transparency into shipments with the intention of better aligning demand and capacity. Our principal focus – company focus is still on execution in the sense of producing reliable results over time.  At the same time, we are currently in a position of both strategic opportunity and a relatively strong strategic position, which is the outcome of both organic development and selective acquisition. 2017 was a year of aggressive strategic development with major product announcements, eight announced acquisitions, and significant channel development initiatives. 2018 is continuing that trend with the announcement of the e-Builder acquisition. E-Builder represents a strong product, organizational and financial platform from which to meet the construction industry’s need for improved project delivery tools. It represents significant upside for Trimble. E-Builder has historically been focused on providing North American owners with program management capability.  With Trimble’s organizational reach, we will bring the e-Builder product immediately to large contractors and also extend its market reach internationally. In the near future, we will bring a revamped product to smaller contractors.  Let me turn the call over to Rob. Before I do that, let me provide an introduction to Johan Wibergh who is appointed to the Trimble Board of Directors last week. Johan is currently the Group Technology Officer and CIO for Vodafone. Besides a strong – broad technology perspective, Johan will provide specific deep insight into emerging technologies, which are integral to Trimble’s future including the cloud, cyber security, and connectivity. In addition, he brings significant insight to the practicalities operating across a wide range of international environments. Rob?
Robert Painter: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I have three main topics to cover this afternoon. First, a recap of Q4 2017 and to a lesser extent overall 2017.Second, I will discretely address topics of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and our ASC 606 implementation. Third, I will cover Q1 guidance, where I will stick to our practice of guiding the quarter and not the year. Let’s start on Slide 5 with our review of the fourth quarter results. Top-line and bottom-line results came in ahead of plan, meeting our significantly exceeding expectations in all reporting segments. Fourth quarter total revenue was $708 million, up 21% year-over-year.  Within that, currency translation added approximately 2% and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added about 5%. Organic growth was approximately 14%, which resulted in our seventy quarter in a row of accelerating organic growth. Notably, the rate of organic growth increased in all segments.  In short, our construction businesses are healthy. Our transportation segment continued its growth trajectory, largely as a result of the first phase of the electronic logging device mandate that went into effect in December. Agriculture end-markets continue to improve and our geospatial segment continues to benefit from new product introductions, improving end-markets such as oil and gas, as well as a couple of large contract completions. Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margins were 56%, down 90 basis points year-over-year driven mostly by acquisitions, but also impacted by strong hardware sales in the quarter. Operating income dollars increased 18% to $126.3 million, while the operating margin percentage dropped to 17.8% largely due to acquisition effects. On an organic basis, operating margins expanded year-over-year and were just under 19%.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income was up approximately 24% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.39, up $0.08 or 26% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined from 24% to 23% year-over-year, reflecting geographic income mix.  Next on Slide 6, full year total revenue was $2.65 billion, up 12.4% year-over-year with organic growth at about 10%. Full year non-GAAP net income was about $380 million, up 26% from prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $1.48, up $0.29 or 24%.  Turning to tax, please note that on a GAAP basis, net income for both the fourth quarter and the year were negatively impacted by additional tax expense of $85 million on the sum of accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings and deferred tax impacts, a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being enacted. As this tax legislation was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect to see ongoing IRS guidance and accounting interpretation over the next 12 months. The accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax remeasurements and other items associated with the tax legislation are provisional due to the forthcoming guidance in our own ongoing analysis.  Slide 7 has an overview of our current assessment of the impact. Our non-GAAP tax rate going into 2018 is currently expected to drop from 23% to 20%. This rate could be impacted in the future by forthcoming IRS and accounting guidance regarding the tax legislation.  We do not anticipate any fundamental changes to our business as a discrete result of its change in tax legislation. Our capital allocation policies remain consistent, albeit further enhanced by the ability to bring cash back onshore for more efficient capital deployment. For example, we will fund approximately $250 million of the e-Builder acquisition from this cash repatriation, whereas previously that would have required incremental debt. Turning to Slide 8, we finished the year with $537 million of cash and short-term investments, and our gross debt level at the end of the fourth quarter was $914 million. Deferred revenue increased 10% to $313 million.  Operating cash flow for the year was relatively flat year-over-year given the inventory investments we are making in this environment of growth and tightening capacity on some key components. We also repurchased $288 million of stock for the year representing approximately 7.4 million shares.  Turning now to a review of the reporting segments. Let’s start with Transportation on Slide 9. Revenue was up 24% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 1% and acquisitions adding about 4%.  Over the past two years, Transportation has been our fastest growing segment on an organic basis. Our Mobility business benefited in the quarter from the first phase of ELD regulations in North America going into effect on the 18 of December along with other product and market adjacencies such as video and OEM sales. Our enterprise business in routing, navigation and transportation management also continued to experience SaaS revenue growth. Our business in Europe and India continued to expand further validating our execution model.  Operating income margins decreased by 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis as a result of product mix and targeted investment in certain high opportunity customer areas. To put a little more color on the product mix, the telematics aspect of the business that benefited from ELD is delivered by a solution with an onboard computer and an ongoing SaaS subscription. The hardware or onboard computer has comparatively low margins. Therefore, the comparatively high installation volume during the fourth quarter drove lower gross margins in the quarter.  Next, let’s turn to resources and utilities on Slide 10. Segment revenue was up 38% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 2% and acquisitions providing a positive effect of about 23%, which primarily reflects the acquisition of Müller with a smaller impact from recent forestry acquisitions. In agriculture, we continue to experience healthy growth in markets such as Europe, Russia and Brazil reflecting penetration-related growth opportunities. In the United States, we experienced another quarter of growth in our aftermarket business and also saw growth across our key OEM partners. We continued to see double-digit growth in our Correction Services business and our forestry business.  Operating margins contracted 480 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 24.9% impacted primarily by Müller and the three acquisitions we made in the forestry space. Please note that organic operating margins were up year-over-year. As we enter 2018, we expect our recent acquisitions in resources and utilities to be accretive to EPS. Within the next few years, we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to company operating margins. Given the historically high margins in this reporting segment, we continue to expect modest dilution of operating margins at the reporting segments.  Moving to geospatial on Slide 11, revenue was up approximately 11% year-over-year with currency translation adding approximately 2% and divestitures subtracting about 1%. Organic revenue was up in the segment for the fourth quarter in a row. Within the segment, our optical and G&S SaaS equipment posted growth including growth in the North American market where we achieved our best growth since the second quarter of 2014. Our geospatial business continues to benefit from new product introductions, including a recently launched mechanical total station production line for our emerging markets, as well as end-market diversification. Furthermore, we experienced strong sales of our industrial based technologies to automotive companies for development of their autonomous technology programs. Operating margins in the segment were 20.5%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to revenue growth and gross margin expansion and partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.  Let’s next turn to the buildings and infrastructure reporting segment on Slide 12. Segment revenue was up more than 18% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 3% and no acquisition impact in the quarter. Both the building construction business and the civil engineering construction business were up double-digits for the quarter reflecting continued strength we saw throughout the year.  The impact of growth in operating leverage enabled us to expand operating margins 350 basis points to 21.3%. As Steve mentioned, we are very excited about the future contributions to our construction business from the acquisition of e-Builder, the description of which is detailed on Slide 13.  From a financial standpoint, e-Builder reported approximately $53 million of revenue in 2017, with over 20% revenue growth rates and over 65% subscription revenue. In the first year, the impact of acquisition accounting in addition to incremental interest expense for the acquisition is expected to be $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive to earnings per share in 2018. After these accounting effects cycle through, we expect e-Builder to continue its strong growth profile with operating margins similar to the rest of the buildings and infrastructure reporting segment in 2019. To finance the acquisition, we executed a $300 million credit facility.  Next, Slide 14. Our revenue mix by region is listed. North America was up 17% year-over-year, where each of the four reporting segments grew on a year-over-year basis. Europe was up 36% in the fourth quarter, reflective of the addition of Müller, which drives a majority of its revenue in Europe. Growth is relatively broad based and led by markets including Germany, UK, France, Finland and Russia. Currency translation contributed about 7% to this growth rate with organic growth in the low-teens. Asia Pacific revenue was up 14% in the quarter and continued to be led by growth in Japan, Australia, India and Korea. Each of our reporting segments had growth in the region. Lastly, rest of world was up 16% with notable increases in markets such as Brazil and the Middle East.  Moving now to Slide 15 and our revenue mix. Software services and recurring revenue streams continued to grow in absolute dollar terms and represent approximately $1.25 billion or 47% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. Recurring revenue represents approximately $750 million or 28% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. The steady percentages of revenue mix reflect broad based growth in revenue including strong hardware revenue growth within the geospatial agriculture, civil construction and transportation businesses. Let’s turn to Slide 16. We did not close any new acquisitions in the fourth quarter. However, in January, we announced both e-Builder and Stabiplan, both are in the buildings and infrastructure reporting segment.  Let’s now move to guidance and go to Slide 17. Steve addressed our views looking forward into the year. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $700 million and $730 million and non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.36 and $0.40 per share.  Three comments to provide context to guidance. First, with respect to top-line growth, the midpoint of the range implies more than 16% year-over-year revenue growth, of which approximately $40 million or over 6% is from acquisitions. In Q1, we expect solid organic growth. Albeit lighter than the trend of the last few quarters, primarily a result of transportation companies catching their breath to implement a new ELD technology. Second, in terms of profitability, the midpoint of our guidance assumes a Q1 2018 non-GAAP operating margin that is similar to the Q1 2017 operating margin of 17.8%. To break that down, we expect organic operating margins to be in the 19% range offset by margin dilutions from recent acquisitions. Margins would be even higher where not for the temporary cost associated with the ASC 606 and tax reform work. Our guidance also includes a lighter contribution versus prior quarters a non-operating income, which falls below the operating income line. Interest expense will step-up in Q1 as a result of our increased leverage and we are also making a targeted investment in one of our joint ventures in the first half. Third, our guidance reflects revenue recognition under ASC 605 accounting. We are moving to the new ASC 606 guidelines in Q1 meaning that we will report Q1 under 606 even though we are guiding under 605 accounting. We have elected to adopt 606 using the full retrospective method, which will restate 2016 for the total year and 2017 by quarter under 606. What this means is that you will be able to see apples-to-apples comparables of our Q1 results under 606 accounting versus Q1 2017 results under 606 accounting. It is our intention to publish these recast 2016 and 2017 financials before our next earnings call.  As such, during the Q1 earnings call, we will focus the conversations on top-line and bottom-line progression from Q1 2017 to Q1 2018, both of which will be reported under 606 accounting. While we continue to assess all impacts of the new guidance, we currently expect for 2018, on an annual basis, that the 606 accounting will not have a material impact. Whoever it is anticipated that the timing of a portion of the revenue may shift between quarters, primarily due to the accounting for software term licenses and custom professional service contracts.  The majority of our revenue, which is related to hardware, software perpetual license, SaaS and other service and support offerings are expected to remain substantially unchanged. So to summarize the guidance takeaway, as Steve said, we largely expect the continuation of the trends from the second half of 2017 into 2018.  Overall, we currently expect full year revenue growth in the low to mid-teens. From a profitability perspective, over the course of the year, we expect to drive the company towards an operating leverage model, consistent with the performance of the overall business in 2017, that is in the 25% range or better leading to full year operating margin expansion. With that, let’s now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman : Yes, Steve, could you kind of speak a little bit to e-Builder and how it better positions you perhaps in the construction space? Could you just maybe just kind of speak to it strategically?
Steve Berglund: Yes, well, I think, again, the framework here I think the beginning point is really to look at the workflow really from kind of pre-design, design into the actual site preparation and then, okay, the project management ultimately I suppose into the operate phase. And so, we have something let’s say right across the workflow and kind of the key point in the script was really to emphasize the fact that it is holistic that it is about bringing comprehensive solutions that touch each of these different elements of the workflow.  I think e-Builder represents a significant addition to our capability. It’s really focused on managing the project. Now their relative focus is on owners more so, than general – they’ve chosen focus on owners, more so than general contractors.  But I think it gives us, first of all a bigger representation with owners, gives us a strong software platform that will include their contribution as well as our software products, for example prolines and prologue that will give us some more comprehensive set of answers to managing the project, it will give us a stronger representation in the owner and gives us a project – a stronger project – product platform to bring to the market.  So I think it is definitely an extension of what we are doing today, but it gives us kind of emphatically more presence in terms of the project management, which again I think is the central consideration in terms of this workflow managing the project. 
Richard Eastman : Okay. And then, just maybe a slightly bigger picture question, but I think, Rob, you kind of spoke on the last slide, you kind of spoke to 2018 kind of revenue maybe range, in that again, quick math says that maybe the core growth then for Trimble would be around 10%.  And maybe the question is on the four segments, does any of those decelerates, I guess, maybe transportation, logistics, is it better assumption there to be mid-single-digit, thinking for four groups of the four core growth rates that would be likely in 2018?
Robert Painter: You said deceleration, you mean from 2018 versus full year 2017, right?
Richard Eastman : Yes, from 2017, right, decelerating into 2018 just given the strength we’ve seen there, but if you were to line up the four business groups against that, say a 10% core growth rate, could you just kind of give a little bit of color on either side of 10% for the four business groups?
Robert Painter: Sorry, yes, that’s pretty straightforward. If you look at the four reporting segments, where we generally have characterized and stay consistent with that is that geospatial is the most mature of the four reporting segments. So, when I think about the overall company growth profile, I would tend to have a lower expectation for geospatial amongst the – versus the other three segments.  When we look at the other three segments, our assertion remains the same as we see secular – strong secular trends in each of these markets really, construction agriculture, and transportation. Large global industries that are underserved and underpenetrated by technology and that’s what drives the secular play in which in our view on an – what’s called ongoing basis, gives us conviction that these businesses, call it, mid to high-single-digit growth opportunity and obviously in the last – mid-to-high single digits we’ve posted.  So that’s would be how I characterize our views on the growth opportunities for those businesses and then to compare 2018 growth versus 2017 versus 2017 growth, the one, yes, of the four reporting segments, transportation would be the one that I would look at for a modest amount of deceleration – growth deceleration versus the other three given the comp.
Richard Eastman : Okay, all right. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your line is open. Jerry Revich, your line is open.  Your next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer, your line is open.  Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open. 
Jonathan Ho: Hi, could you hear me?
Steve Berglund: Yes, we can hear you.
Jonathan Ho: Yes, just want to make sure that the connection was still there. So, just wanted to get some thoughts at a high level around penetration and as you’ve seen your customers start to scale their suites, how should we be thinking about, some of the Darwinian effects that you’ve talked about in the past, maybe play out when we look at penetration of, things like machine control, and just technology more broadly? 
Steve Berglund: Yes, so, I think it varies from industry-to-industry. Certainly, it would be my, call it personal to you, I don’t know if there is compelling evidence one way or the other here. But I think there is a growing sense with the construction industry that it is Darwinian and is that contractors either have the choice of investing in technology to stay competitive or they run the risk of becoming increasingly irrelevant and ultimately disappearing.  So I think that, with kind of the revival around the world, and particularly I think the argument would be strongest in the U.S. followed by Europe, but as markets revive, I think the level of kind of the scale or the quality of the competition is changing and increasingly if it is possible to get 10%, 20%, 25% project cost improvements through the use of technologies, I think it is increasingly becoming Darwinian.  Now, at the same time, strong markets also lead to, perhaps the level of complacencies. So this will take some time to play out, because right now many of the contractors out there have backlogs that extend out a year or two, and so they surely say, isn’t kind of the cutting edge. So, I think the improving economies cut both ways in that sense.  Agriculture, I think will be – is ultimately probably plays out in the same way, but on a slower time or longer time horizons, simply because farmers don’t face the same kind of binary world that contractors do. Contractors either win deals or lose deals of farmers that have been a kind of more of an analog universe.  I think transportation is the same, probably in some ways more developed than the other markets from a penetration standpoint, large operators in the U.S. have adopted at least the fundamentals of technology, although the technology keeps advancing and there is more and more scope for operators to improve their basic operations.  So I would say, I think, and I think theme of at least my remarks earlier in the call were that, I think that the general rate of technological change is now accelerating driven both by capabilities from the technology, but also I think from kind of competitive forces. So I would say is, over the next few years, I think the penetration rate will accelerate and hopefully will be reflected in our growth rates.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then, in your commentary around gross margins, on a reported basis, they seem to be down, but up organically, can you give us a little bit more color on what’s happening there and how we should think about that leverage, some of your quite deferred write-downs start to come back in 2018?
Steve Berglund: Well, looking into 2018, and deferred write-downs, that would be premature to look at how that’s going to impact margins and we will report against that at the end of [Indiscernible] With respect to the margin profile in the fourth quarter, the – of our gross margin, so if you think about in the beat we had on revenue, there was a good amount of it driven in the transportation business, specifically from the ELD surge and demand at the end of the quarter.  That demand for ELD is really driving hardware first, because it’s a model that has an onboard computer which is hardware and then the SaaS subscription that’s associated with that. We make higher margins on the SaaS. We make low margin on the hardware. We sell from our hardware units and we expect it and anticipate it in the fourth quarter in December.  And so, that specific line of hardware just using an example, but one that definitely moved the needle has a lower gross margin profile. And that played out by the time you added at. 
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich : Hi, good afternoon. 
Steve Berglund: Hey, Jerry. 
Jerry Revich : Rob, I wonder if you can elaborate us on the Müller integration. I know it’s early, but what’s the operating plan in terms of when your global distribution, particularly your distribution that you ask you expect to offer to the Müller product range and can you also update us on excluding acquisition accounting, how the market performance in this business versus overall segment and what’s the organic growth that you are seeing flown through on the Müller business within your results, could you comment?
Robert Painter: So, the acquisition thus far is exceeding the expectations we had in our own deal models that we feel very good about where we are thus far, I’ll say financially with the deal, I think from a people perspective, the teams are coming together very nicely and so that has met or exceeded our expectations as cultures and the values line-up well in the organizations.  As it relates to the nature of the business that Müller, I’ll call it the business mix Müller has versus our traditional guidance-centric business, Müller has a European centricity, where we have historically had a North American centricity. Müller has had an OEM centricity where Trimble has the guidance business has an aftermarket centricity.  And so, the strategy then is, how do we bring more of the Müller technology into the aftermarket and then to North America and how do we leverage their OEM relationships in the European business that Müller has for the rest of the – I’ll say the rest of the Trimble portfolio.  We are in early days on that aspect of, let’s call it the channel and product integration, but we feel really quite encouraged by the - I’ll say the level of quality and thought and the plans that we have the – and I’ll say the energy that we have from the channel to actually execute upon this offering.  So it’s as much about having the right product and technology as it is about getting the go to market right. So, I would say, stay tuned to see how this is really playing out, but we feel quite confident in what we are doing here with the combined organizations. 
Jerry Revich : Okay. And separately for the transportation business, can you talk about where you see the puts and takes for 2018 for the business in terms of what’s the magnitude of headwinds from some slowdown as you put it as the truckers catch your rep from ELD mandate, what’s the magnitude of that headwind for your hardware business? And then, as we enter 2018, can you just talk about directionally, how much the subscription revenue business within P&L is up year-over-year? How much of a tailwind that adds just to frame that issue for us? 
Robert Painter: So, one of the questions, I’ve been asked most over the course over the last year is would we see some kind of cliff of demand after the 18th of December when the mandate went into effect and I hope I’ve been consistent about characterizing it as emphatically not a cliff of demand, now we expected to see a change and slope of the demand.  But we still will see demand and it comes for a few reasons. One is which is that, if you actually technical break it down, there is – as we think on AOBRD, Automatic Onboard Recording Device, so if you actually have – if you are AOBRD compliant, you actually have another two years to be full ELD compliant.  So, there is a two-step, call it, wave here. So we are through wave one of two and so there will still be demand over the next couple of years as customers, as companies move from AOBRD compliance and to full EOD compliance. So that will generate a certain amount of demand itself. The second aspect of where we would see continued growth.  And we do expect to see continued growth in the segment this year is, we have an installed base, now think about the adjacent product offerings that we have and we’ve talked about video as one of those examples. Now you think about a customer, if – so it’s a customer who went more for the, okay, more of the compliance centric aspect of ELD, the Trimble business is ultimately about fleet productivity and full fleet management.  There is a whole upsell opportunity that our teams will be pursuing within the customer base for that element of the customer base that may have just gone lower on adoption to compliance only or compliance solutions.  Third aspect would be, if you take the broader view of our portfolio in transportation, mobility is just one aspect of the portfolio that we have and it is the one that’s benefited the most clearly from ELD. But remember we have an enterprise business in transportation as well with the enterprise business as that’s doing the back-office systems, it’s the ERP, it’s the order to cash systems, it’s the scheduling, it’s the dispatch, it’s the routing and the mapping and the navigation.  We believe that capital budgets, we will be redeploying from an ELD centricity that they’ve had over the last year into the enterprise side of their tucking companies’ business. And we are starting to see that reflect from the bookings that we are picking up in the enterprise side of our business.  So, you add those factors together, and you would have our thesis for where we see continued good growth in the Transportation business on a year-over-year basis, albeit I would expect at this point that it would be slightly less than, or moderately less than what we saw last year on a year-over-year basis. 
Jerry Revich : That’s very clear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Foster with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Yuuji Anderson: Hi, it’s Yuuji Anderson on for James. Thanks for taking my questions. I was curious to hear more about acquisitions for 2018. I think at the beginning of last year, you gave some color on expected acquisitions for the full year, just I am wondering what it looks like for 2018 excluding the two acquisitions that you’ve already made.  Should we expect things to be about the same? Or maybe things start decelerating? And if so, how should we think about capital allocation plans? Should we expect that to go more aggressively towards debt pay downs or share repurchases? Thanks. 
Steve Berglund: Yes, I think, I’ve got really no choice, but to be relatively opaque on the subject since we really can’t be talking about future plans, a year too much speculation involved. I would in general say that, looking at 2017, we announced eight acquisitions in 2017, which against recent standards for us was a comparatively aggressive year.  I think, well, year-to-date, we’ve announced the two that Rob mentioned, e-Builder being the larger one. And I think that it’s probably – if you are going to kind of land somewhere, just kind of giving a very general direction, I would say, 2018 given the nature of the markets, given the changes that are occurring in the markets.  And given the changes occurring in the markets that we are addressing that are pretty strategic and kind of represent a – something of a strategic inflection point, maybe pretty much across the board, I would say is that, as I think, we are clearly indicating here, we are being pretty aggressive strategically in terms of looking to be a central player in construction, in agriculture and in transportation.  And I think that, yes, our fundamental priority is to do it organically, but I think that, we are looking the acquisition to supplement it. So, I would say, if we are going to land somewhere, provisionally, I would say, 2018 looking like 2017 is probably a pretty good approximation of what’s called the current mental state of Trimble.  I don’t necessarily see it a slacking off in 2018 from the 2017 levels. We’ll see about whether we accelerate it, but I would say, kind of the same mentality that took us through 2017 exists in 2018. And jumping in for Rob, here is, I think our priorities are use our cash flow to serve the business in terms of providing growth platforms for the business.  And if we have excess cash beyond the needs, that that implies it would be to probably a focus on share buyback simply to return the excess cash in a form that’s useful to the shareholder. 
Yuuji Anderson: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alexander Frankiewicz with Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Alexander Frankiewicz : Hi, thanks for taking my call and congrats on the – thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter guys. I sort of – couple quick questions, first on SketchUp, I was wondering if you could give some more color number of users, market share in that segment and if you planning going to subscription or a SaaS offering with SketchUp?
Steve Berglund: So, in the SketchUp business, we have many millions of user activations every year, so it’s – for us, it’s a unique customer base that we measure a user base and customer base, it’s measured in millions not, let’s say in thousands. What I think would be good to point out and we put it on one of the slides is that, we had a release of SketchUp free.  This – in the fourth quarter and what’s SketchUp is, in addition we had a 2018 SketchUp launch, so what’s SketchUp free is, it’s a web-based version of SketchUp. So, it’s traditionally sold on a kind of perpetual license basis. This is actually a web-enabled version of SaaS and we believe it’s strategically very important because that enables us to extend the reach of the technology, the reach of the platform.  And so think about how that could be embedded in a series of other products and solutions with that form of technology delivery. The benefit of that form of technology delivery as well as that allows us to go SaaS with the model and it is our intention from a free version of SketchUp into a paid version of that web-enabled delivered product to go that. So it is very much a part of our plan that would be measured in a number of quarters to head there not weeks, but that is the direction on SketchUp. 
Alexander Frankiewicz : Okay, thanks. And then, also, just in general on construction software offerings, how many of the new customers in growth are net new versus cross-selling from hardware accounts?
Steve Berglund: Within, so if we take it within the buildings and infrastructure segment, we have, we’ll tend to describe it as, Trimble buildings or vertical construction or a horizontal construction which really represents civil engineering and construction. We sell both point solutions as well as suites of products. The strong majority of our sales are sold through point solutions.  However, when you really go back to this – our strategy of connecting the physical and the digital worlds, we are creating the digital model that ends up on the blade of a dozer or – it’s the software and the hardware. You can’t have one without the other. It’s – if you are in the vertical construction business and we make the constructible model, the digital model.  And then we can take that out to the field to our layout devices where you can actually layout the points, whether it’s a footer or whether it’s – where the hangers are going to go in a MEP installation, it’s connecting that digital with the physical. And so, many of our solutions do come with a – let’s say a bundle offering. But the strong majority are sold, I'll call them, individual at this point. 
Alexander Frankiewicz : Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. 
Brett Wong : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just dig into e-Builder for a quick second and it seems like the multiples were little higher than what you historically have paid, especially, even when you look at some software M&A back in the day.  So I was just wondering, what about e-Builder drove the decision to kind of pay up compared to normal and really kind of multiple standpoint, is that – are these – is that kind of a consistent multiple that you are seeing for other offerings, or similar offerings in this space?
Robert Painter: Hey, Brett, this is Rob. So I would look at three things. I would look at the strategy, the business model, and the competitive environment. And if I start with the business model it’s a SaaS business. So two-thirds of the revenue is SaaS. The rest is mostly the – so that SaaS revenue stream is attractive and the reality of competitive environment is that it does have revenue stream than you would see what’s perpetual software and you would see with hardware.  Also about what the business model is, it’s a company with – and last year with over 20% EBITDA margins, growing over 20%, things growing at 5%. So that, rule of 40, you hear about, software companies or SaaS software companies achieving that and of course that will them come play into evaluation. When you look at the strategy and I think that’s probably really the play, I’d say.  That should get started and that’s what Steve covered in his commentary is that, we think it helps us achieve a leading position in project delivery and helps us execute on an owner-driven strategy and construction. Think about, I’ll say that, take a building, the construction of a building, who has the most to gain or lose by that construction being done on time and on budget, that’s the owner.  And if you look at the lifetime cost of actually occupying a building, about 80% of it occurs after you are actually in the building itself. Its design and engineering and execution and build and whole operational phase means a great deal to the owner over that life cycle and that’s strategically is what we – is one of the things we saw very important and compelling about this business. And then, the last I would say is it was, certainly a competitive process. This is a great team and a great business. 
Brett Wong : That’s really helpful, Rob. Thanks. And switching gears to the resource industry or segment, you talked a little bit about some of the strong growth in some international markets, but just wondering how the North American market has been obviously has been growing as much, you said everything grew a little bit, but a little more color there would be helpful. And then, if you just – no outlook for 2018, if you are seeing any uptick in kind of the North American demand, that will be helpful too. Thanks. 
Robert Painter: Sure, so we did grow in North America. So, well, yes, I have been focusing lately on talking about Brazil, Russia, Europe, CIS countries, Asia Pacific where we have been growing faster than North America. We did grow in North America we grew in our aftermarkets business in North America.  Our OEM business also grew in the North American market and as you know the commodity prices remained – certainly remain challenged, but we seem to see that the farmers are adjusting to what appears to be a new normal. We see capital being deployed, in other words, machinery being bought. I think the tax change, I think that bodes well going forward in the market where the accelerated depreciation I think is sectional 79 goes further into law and not only will it cover new equipment.  But it actually expands to cover used equipment and we think that the purchase of equipment versus, let’s say the leasing of equipment has a more favorable dynamic when it comes to the adoption of technology on machine. So, we add up those factors and what we’ve been seeing in North America, we would anticipate coming into 2018. I still think 2018 in North America, that would tend to – I believe that will – while we believe we will grow, I think the growth still outside of North America would exceed that of North America. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch : For the technical difficulties earlier. Could you talk about the magnitude of the opportunity in autonomy within the transportation space? And then if you could give us some color just on pacing around that, how much leverage you are getting from the experience with mining and agriculture and how that might mix again with ELD opportunity? 
Steve Berglund: Yes, so, maybe without being – again, perhaps being a little bit of opaque here because I think it’s an evolving scenario for us. So I think that first of all, this is truly I think across Trimble set of opportunities that the capabilities in construction, agriculture and transportation, I think really represent something of a unified hold from a technology perspective and we can apply that accumulated technology base to various vertical markets.  I would say, in the shorter-term, the greater opportunity is probably for Trimble, particularly, in an end-user sense is probably more in the off-road construction and agriculture, I think that’s the place where we can maybe have the more persuasive influence. I think in transportation, there are number of opportunities for us, I think driving a truck, tractor trailer across open road in Colorado is one think.  I think there's a whole set of complexities about the final mile that make the application quite difficult and kind of looking at it holistically, I think, in transportation, long-haul trucking, it would be as that such as the final mile where we may have something particular to say there. But we are engaged with OEMs we are engaged in kind of with end-users in transportation.  I think the other thing not necessarily, taking the right wider arm of transportation including passenger vehicles in it, again it’s a place where Trimble has an opportunity to play in that mass market is really in terms of providing precision location.  I think in the last 18 to 24 months, there is a greater appreciation that it is not just about relative position, but also absolute position in terms of where that passenger vehicle is, what lane specifically is that vehicle in, when we start to talk to that level of precision, Trimble, through its position augmentation services, space based augmentation services has something of value to provide into the application.  So, right now, it’s a relatively broad based kind of category for us in terms of autonomy that includes construction, includes agriculture, includes a couple of aspects of transportation. Our view is not that this isn’t about a specific endpoint. I think our general corporate view is that this is really a continuum.  There are a number of stopping points before really arrive at a complete autonomy as a no operator, no driver sort of autonomy and but that is really a step – a series of steps of increasing automation and that’s really the way – that’s our construct and that’s how we are approaching it and I think it’s the generally the healthiest way for us to approach it as a company. 
Colin Rusch : Okay, thanks so much. I’ll probably take some follow-ups offline. And then could you talk a little bit about pricing dynamics within the software market for construction? Are you seeing any meaningful price pressure at this point and is that the e-Builder acquisition in part defensive in any capacity?
Steve Berglund: No, first of all, I would describe e-Builder as basically looking to the market at the future and I would see this is opportunity and really there are no particular defensive aspects to the e-Builder transaction. I would say is, I don’t think that there are any, what I would call, notable pricing pressures in construction software at this point in time.  I think, in some cases, there is a tendency to bundle, okay, which in, kind of a line item level might represent some pricing pressure. But in general, I think the – this is more about opportunity and upside and the value sell more so than kind of pricing pressure as in a discrete sale. So I think it’s more about selling value and okay, pricing for value, more so than, let’s call it, pricing pressure for kind of a line item in an invoice. 
Colin Rusch : Perfect. Thanks so much guys. 
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Leyba.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, Justy, and thank you, everyone for attending today's call. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jona, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Leyba. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Michael Leyba : Thanks, Jona. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I’m here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today’s call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast, and we will be referring to the presentation today. Turning to slide two of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the Company’s Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today’s call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide three for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter; after that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter and our guidance; and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to slide four and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Third quarter results came in at the high end of our expectations and continued to build on the growth moment of the last eight quarters. The goodness [ph] of the quarter can be encapsulated in three points. First, the relative strength was company-wide with all four reporting segments, reflecting meaningful year-to-year progression. Second, if baseline is the organic performance of the businesses in place a year ago, our baseline performance for the quarter was strong with year-to-year organic revenue growth of over 10%, baseline non-GAAP operating margins of roughly 20% and baseline operating leverage of 27%, acquisitions added over 3 points of growth, but as expected they also diluted earnings in the short-term. Third, regional performance was also positive. North America, Europe and South America were all up double digits, while Asia and the Middle East grew but at a slower rate. The improved performance in North America’s potentially meaningful because North America has been something of an underachiever for us and an improvement could accelerate the aggregate performance. This North American buoyancy is occurring in spite of continuing ambiguities about U.S. infrastructure spend, tax reform, and trade policy. The most dramatic change year-to-year was in the Resources and Utilities segment, which reported a revenue increase of over 30%. Although, the five announced acquisitions year-to-date contributed to the growth, underlying year-to-year organic growth for the segment was double digits. The most significant acquisition, in fact, was Müller which was completed in July and is performing in line with our acquisition model and is generating positive market reactions. Although the acquisitions reduced segment profitability for the quarter, in part because of seasonality, we anticipate their effect to be additive over full year. Transportation continues to demonstrate the highest organic growth in the Company with contributions from North America and Europe. Although external effects such as ELD mandate are providing some of the momentum, our continuing innovation and market penetration initiatives are driving current growth as well as providing the foundation for future expansion. The Building and Infrastructure segment grew by over 13% in the quarter with significant margin expansion. The growth came from both the vertical and horizontal elements of the business. Perhaps the most encouraging elements of the quarter was the apparent market acceleration in North America. Beyond North America, the buoyancy in the segment was relatively widespread and global with double-digit growth in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. Although we remain hopeful that the Washington centered discussions on infrastructure may lead to something, our expectations do not include any effect from a step-up in U.S. spending. We are encouraged that beyond the record, infrastructure discussions in Congress have acknowledged that any build out should incorporate technology to improve the technology to improve the outcomes. We are also encouraged by the tendency for some of the states to control their own destiny by initiating infrastructure programs without relying on federal funding. Finally, although, rebuilding the hurricane-impacted areas in the U.S. will undoubtedly have an impact, we do not expect it to be material. The Geospatial segment demonstrated respectable revenue growth and year-to-year earnings improvement. Our results continue to be favorably influenced by new products and regional strength, particularly in North America and Europe. The last 12 months have been strong on innovation with the introduction of the SX10 late last year and the recent introduction of new Mechanical Total Stations, in both cases to strong market enthusiasm. Although, Geospatial is technically the most mature of the Trimble segments, we are demonstrating that innovation can drive incremental demand. Overall, Company performance in the last six months is consistent with the historical Trimble standard, which was established before the impact of agricultural and oil price declines. Although, we have no quantified view to share on 2018, we currently expect next year to be roughly consistent with current performance levels, assuming no major macro surprises. There is some potential lift in 2018 from ongoing strategic trends and initiatives. We have discussed all of these elements before, but I’ll summarize six of the major themes. The first is M&A. With eight, mostly small acquisitions year-to-date, we have obviously stepped up our acquisition activity from 2015 and 2016 levels. This reflects no change in our long-standing acquisition strategy, which remains focused on adding increments of technology or market through acquisition with anticipated network effects in the market. In the last two or three years, we have placed renewed emphasis on ensuring both strategic fit and early financial performance from the acquisitions we do make. Another strategic trend is our growing network of OEM relationships across all segments. Although we remain an emphatic end-user company, OEM relationships do facilitate adoption by the user and accelerated market penetration. Over the last two years, we have established a string of meaningful new OEM relationships, which have provided us with new machine platforms, which can be integrated into our information ecosystem. Another point of strategic emphasis is in the Transportation segment. Initiatives in this segment include efforts to develop a driver community, to improve transparency to enable improved alignment between capacity and demand, to establish the Trimble freight cloud, and to establish a first mover advantage in the application of Blockchain. The fourth element of strategic focus revolves around information and analytics. This represents a major push across all our segments and includes comp conversion of traditional software licenses to SaaS and the use of cloud resident data to power analytics embedded in new categories of applications. Because of Trimble’s footprint in both hardware and information, we are uniquely positioned to facilitate the two-way exchange between the physical and digital worlds. Our fifth strategic initiative is centered on autonomy. The concept is relevant in all of our segments and we are engaged in multiple ways. Although the end result may turn out to be complete autonomy, the timetable is ambiguous, and our approach is centered on maintaining progression along a continuum of increasing automation. An example of this approach is represented by the recent introduction of our 3D excavator machine control system, which moves us a significant distance towards automating the bucket operation without removing the operator from the cab. Final point of strategic activity is DEM and Trimble’s extension of the concept to the constructible model. We have developed and acquired most of the pieces necessary for a comprehensive solution over the last several years. A strategic emphasis for 2017 and into 2018, is to increasingly integrate these elements into a compelling total solution. Let me turn the call over to Rob. A quick summery before I do that is to say that we’re seeing improved market conditions and that we’re well-positioned to exploit those conditions based on our past investments and innovation.
Rob Painter: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Let’s start on slide five. Our third quarter results came in ahead of expectations with top line and bottom line results meeting or exceeding expectations in all reporting segments. Third quarter total revenue was $670 million, up 14.7% year-over-year. Within that, currency translation added approximately 1%, and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added about 3%. Organic growth was over 10%. And we’re now in our 6th quarter of accelerating organic growth. Notably, the rate of organic growth increased in all segments. In short, we continue to experience generally favorable conditions in our construction markets, the electronic login device mandate as a catalyst for transportation growth, agriculture continues to recover, and new product introductions are benefiting Geospatial as well many of our other businesses. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margins were 56.1%, down 80 basis year-over-year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, gross margins were relatively flat. Operating income increased to 12% to $123.6 million while the operating margin percentage dropped to 18.4%, primarily due to acquisition effect. On an organic basis, operating margins expanded year-over-year and were just under 20%. Third quarter non-GAAP net income was up approximately 19% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.39, up $0.06 or 18% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined from to 24% to 23% year-over-year, reflecting geographic income mix. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, please turn to slide six. We finished the quarter with [$509] million of cash and short-term investments and our gross debt level at the end of the third quarter was $696 million, leaving us ample flexibility from a capital allocation perspective, despite recent acquisitions and share repurchases. Deferred revenue increased 11% to $327million. Operating cash flow decreased in the quarter to $61 million, primarily due to increased inventory investment and the growth environment we’re seeing coupled with the comparatively strong cash flow comp last year. Operating cash flow on year to date basis is up 8% and up 19% on a trailing 12-month basis. Net working capital, defined as accounts receivable plus inventory minus payables, accrued compensation and total deferred revenue, remains near 3% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Turning now to review the reporting segments. Let’s start with Transportation on slide seven. Revenue was up over 16% year-over-year with currency translation adding less than 1% and acquisitions adding less than 4%. Over the past two years, Transportation has been our fastest growing segment on an organic basis. Our mobility business continues to benefit from the fourth coming ELD regulations in North America along with other initiatives such as video and OEM sales. Our enterprise businesses in routing, navigation and transportation management continue to experience fast revenue growth. Finally, in our rail business, we are seeing the positive collective impacts of recent acquisitions coming together to deliver unique customer value and revenue growth. Revenue growth in combination with both cost control and strategic investments enabled us to expand operating margins by 20 basis points to 18.2%. Operating margins would have expanded more without the negative effect from recent acquisitions.  Next, turning to Resources and Utilities on slide eight. Segment revenue was up 31% year-over-year with currency translation adding less than 2%, and acquisitions and divestitures providing a positive effect of about 18%, which primarily reflects the acquisition of Müller. In agriculture, we continue to experience healthy growth in markets such as Europe, Russia and Brazil, which continue to reflect penetration-related growth opportunities. In the United States we experienced another quarter of growth in our aftermarket business and also saw growth across our key OEM partners. We continue to see double-digit growth in our correction services business which enables our customers to achieve high levels of positioning accuracy in the field. Finally, in our forestry business much like our rail business, we are seeing the positive collective impact of recent acquisitions, delivering unique customer value and revenue growth. Next, let’s step back and talk about the impact of acquisitions in the segment. In Q3, we closed the acquisition of Müller which provides electronic control unit technology that supports one of the next big opportunities in precision ag, the variable rate application of inputs in the field. As discussed in last quarter’s call, Müller does have seasonality in its revenue, which in turn impacted profit contribution in the third quarter. This seasonality along with the impacts from other acquisitions in the segment had a meaningful negative impact on the operating income margins in the segment. As a result, the operating margins contracted 560 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 23.2%. Please note that organic operating margins were up year-over-year. As we enter 2018, we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to EPS. Within the next couple of years, we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to company operating margins. Given the historically high margins and the Resources and Utilities reporting segment, we may, mathematically speaking, see modest dilution at the reporting segment level. Moving next to the Geospatial segment on slide nine. Revenue was up approximately 6% year-over-year, with currency translation adding approximately 1%, and acquisitions and divestitures subtracting about 2%. Organic revenue was up in the segment for the third quarter in a row. Within the segment, our optical and GNSS equipment posted growth including growth in the North American market where we achieved our best growth since the second quarter of 2014. Our Geospatial business continues to benefit from new products as well as end-market diversification. Operating margins are 21.6%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to product mix and tradeshow expenses in the quarter. For example, the INTERGEO tradeshow was in Q4 in 2016 and in Q3 in 2017. Turning to the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment on slide 10. Segment revenue was up more than 13% year-over-year with currency translation adding about 1% and acquisitions providing a positive effect of less than 1%. The building construction business was up double-digits for the quarter including double-digit increases in our architecture and design, structural engineering, and mechanical electrical and plumbing businesses. Civil engineering and construction business grew double-digits in the quarter with growth in all major regions. Gross margins expanded largely on a higher software mix in the quarter. The impact of growth, gross margin expansion and operating leverage enabled us to expand operating margin 270 basis points to 24.3%. It’s worth noting again this quarter that a meaningful amount of financial performance comes from our 50-50 joint ventures with Caterpillar, Nikon, Hilti, which fall below the line in non-operating income and are therefore not represented in segment results. Equity income in the quarter was almost $9 million, a majority of which came from the Caterpillar joint ventures. On a trailing 12-month basis, equity income represents over $26 million, which if included above the line in the reporting segment, would have further improved operating margins. To put the equity income from our Caterpillar joint ventures into further prospective, the revenue from these joint ventures were up more than 35% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting sales to the parent companies. The profits associated with that turnover flows into the equity income line and the revenue therefore does not consolidate into the Trimble numbers. While on the topic of construction, we thought it would be insightful to share how we’re using our own technology on a building project where we are the project owner. We’re currently building a second building in Colorado that will expand our workforce capacity by an additional 600 people. If you turn to slide 11, you’ll see a sample of some of the 50 plus Trimble solutions we’re using on this project. Like our original building, the second building enables us to once again demonstrate a set of transformative technologies with our surveyors, architects, engineers, trade partners and also our general contractor to drive time and cost efficiencies as well as quality and safety improvements. We create digital models of the physical earth with our geospatial technologies that move into a set of civil and building workflows. In effect, we build it digitally and then build it physically. And we’re using Trimble Connect’s interoperability backbone throughout the project to drive coordination and collaboration. As the project is literally in our backyard, it provides an incredible opportunity to work directly with our partners to drive voice of customer [ph] into our product development. It also provides the unique opportunity to capture return on investment metrics and case studies from technology appointment. We expect our project to be completed on time and on budget late next year. Next, slide 12. By geography, our revenue mix for the quarter was 54% from North America, 24% from Europe, 15% from Asia Pacific and 7% from Rest of World. North America was up 13% year-over-year where each of four reporting segments grew on a year-over-year basis. Europe was up 27% in the third quarter, reflective of the addition of Müller, which drives the majority of its revenue in Europe. Growth was relatively broad-based and led by markets including Germany, UK, France, Finland and Russia. Currency translation contributed about 4% for this growth rate with organic growth in the low teens. Asia Pacific revenue was up 7% in the quarter and continued to be lead by growth in Japan, Australia, and Korea. Growth was strong in Geospatial as well as Buildings and Infrastructure. Lastly, rest of world was up 6% with notable increases in markets such as Argentina and Brazil. Moving now to slide 13 and our revenue mix. Software, services and recurring revenue streams continue to grow in absolute dollar terms and represent approximately $1.2 billion or 47% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. Recurring revenue represents over $700 million or 28% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. The steady percentages of revenue mix reflect broad based growth in revenue including strong growth in hardware among Geospatial, agriculture, civil construction and transportation. The hardware revenue stream also benefited from the inclusion of Müller, where our technology capabilities include embedded software but where the revenue is characterized as hardware. Let’s turn to slide 14. In the third quarter, we close Müller in 10-4 Systems. While the profile of recent acquisitions has a short-term negative impact to operating margins, we expect them to add significant growth and profitability in 2018 and to achieve operating margins approaching the Company average in 2019. Let’s now move to fourth quarter guidance on slide 15. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between $655 million and $685 million and non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.38 per share. Two comments. First, with respect to top line growth, the midpoint of the range implies more than 14% year-over-year revenue growth, which includes greater than $25 million in revenue from acquisitions in our Resources and Utilities, and Transportation reporting segments. Second, in terms of profitability, the midpoint of our guidance assumes the Q4 2017 non-GAAP operating margin that is similar to the year-ago Q4 2016 operating margin of 18.3%. We expect our fourth quarter operating margins to include about 100 basis points of margin dilution from recent acquisitions. As a result, organic margins would otherwise have been in the 19% range and would be higher still were it not for the temporary cost associated with the ASC 606 compliance work. In closing, we will be presenting at the Baird Industrial conference on November 7th and our presentation will be webcast and accessible from the Investor Relations section of our website. Let’s now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Jerry Revich from the Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi. Good afternoon. I’m wondering if you could talk about within the Transportation business, you highlighted pick-up in the business in Europe. Can you just update us on where adoption rates are for your products and what’s driving the pick-up? And if you’re willing to comment on, what additional [ph] OEMs you’re referring to, and the nature of the agreements in the slide? Thanks.
Rob Painter: So, I’ll start with the OEM agreements. That is status quo progress that we have in the Transportation segment. The additional OEM performance, we talked also about in agriculture as well as construction, but then Transportation would be status quo relationship with PACCAR. Our business is primarily in North America, really, the vast majority of our turnover is in North America in this reporting segment. However, we do have some business in Europe, India and Australia that are of note. And business in Europe really is reflective of a little bit of the market growth and expansion, but more so of our competitive product sets and gaining some ground in that respect in Europe.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And Rob, can you just say more about the margin profile of Müller. So, this quarter looks like it was negative from an operating income standpoint, based on M&A accounting; without acquisition based accounting, what would have been the margin profile this quarter? Can you just help us get visibility on how quickly it’ll get to the company average margins based on the accounting that you outlined earlier?
Robert Painter: Sure, I’ll give you directional guidance as we don’t comment on individual -- at individual business level. In the case of Müller, it’s mostly a hardware business. So, from an accounting perspective, they really aren’t substantial negative accounting effects. What we referred to are the seasonal effects for Q3, a seasonal low; in that business, Q1 is a seasonal high. And so, it’s a margin profile that slows accordingly. So, as we come out of Q3 and we come into Q4 and then the beginning of next year that’s where we expect to see the substantial pick-up and really most meaningfully in the first half of next year, starting in Q1.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to start out with some of the discussion you had around the analytics opportunity and maybe combing hardware and the cloud. How do you think about, I guess the go-to-market for that type of solution and how quickly do you think market will adopt this type of solutions?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think in some sense, we could point out -- point at probably a 10 or more year history that’s already in place in terms of combinations of the hardware and software and analytics thing applied. I think to the extent that it’s a new thing for the world, it’s a relatively old thing for Trimble because I think we’ve been doing it for some period of time. Certainly, the rate of -- capability, the rate of change has picked up with the ability to access more data through the cloud. So, I -- certainly, the rate of acceleration or the acceleration rate is increasing. But I think that it’s not necessarily a terribly new thing for Trimble and does not represent a step function for us in that sense. But, yes, that go-to-market and I would say it is a challenge, at least a challenge in terms of many of our markets from the standpoint. On the one hand -- and this not a new issue, I think we’ve been talking about it for some number of years. But, when it comes to software and information in analytics, that would tend to favor, let’s call a more direct style of distribution. But when there is a hardware element and that hardware breaks let’s say on a construction site or on a farm at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, there is a need to deal with it real time in a perfect world having it fixed by the next morning. So, I think in terms of our formula as a company, this isn’t universal, this is in the realm of construction and agriculture, transportation is a little bit more of a linear solution. But, I think it’s a mix, hybrid type distribution channel that’s actually going to be required to be successful in those markets. And again, the construction side, we point to, the SITECH channel we point, to the BuildingPoint channel. On the agriculture side, we point to Vantage channel that we are creating third-party but with let’s call, a whole lot of Trimble must be behind it. And then, again, in Transportation it -- solving the equation tends to be a relatively direct solution. So, the answer is that it depends. But, I think it’s again a not a straight forward sort of consideration, given the complexities of some of these markets.
Jonathan Ho: And then, just as a follow-up. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the SX10 and some of the new products that you’re releasing that maybe extend your lead in Geospatial and some of the interesting business units as well?
Steve Berglund: So, the SX10 was released at the INTERGEO tradeshow roughly a year ago. It is actually a new category of instrument. It combines the characteristics of a conventional Total Station, long standing survey with those of the laser scanner and really creates a new category of survey instrument. There is no true competitor in the market yet after a year. We still tend to be production constraint, more so than market constraint on it. So, it has been a true hit in the marketplace. But, the other product -- couple of products that were released this year at INTERGEO roughly a month ago are Mechanical Total Stations, using the term broadly towards the lower end of the market, less robotics, less automation. But, these units do have auto focus, which again starts to introduce elements of robotics into low-end survey instruments, and again, represents a category but towards a lower price, cheaper, but bringing new functionality and changing the value to cost curve at the lower ends of the survey market. But I think the point there in Geospatial is that, okay, yes, it’s relatively mature market, every surveyor in existence has a tool of some sort or another that enables him or her to do his or her job. But, there is still the ability to replace that instrument with new capability if it brings new productivity and new functionality into play. So, I think that’s the Geospatial innovation. But, I think the other easy example -- a couple of easy other examples to point to in other places of company. First of all is this excavator product in machine control, which is getting very strong market reactions as it’s tested in the workplace and is bringing significant productivity improvements to let’s call it conventional excavator operations and in some ways is enabling on some construction sites, which have traditional called for both an excavator and a bulldozer being on site. The performance of the excavator is not good enough in those cases to actually eliminate the need to bring the bulldozer on the site. So, again, major cost factor for the contractor. And I’d say just to be a little democratic here, pointing at transportation over the last year, year and half, we brought video into the marketplace, which again has been something of a game-changer in terms of bringing new capability into the marketplace and altering a lot of the traditional economics in trucking. So, I think, again, we’re feeling reasonably good as a company in terms of the innovation that we’re displaying across the entire company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: I had a couple of developmental questions. First, you mentioned that you’re investing in Blockchain in your Transportation segment. Can you give us a little insight there as to what the -- like, where you see an opportunity there? I guess, this is relatively new technology. There a lot of people that focus on in the financials area but where you see opportunity in the Transportation segment?
Steve Berglund: If we start with the why, the why is about effectively tracking goods about -- across the supply chain. So, Blockchain itself is just an underlying let’s say technology of the shared ledger in the cloud. I think where we think we have a unique play to track those goods across the supply chain is because we think we have a unique insight into capacity and demand in the transportation market. So, if you think about the business we have in the mobility side with our PeopleNet business and then managing enterprise fleets, trucking fleets. You think about the capabilities we have with our TMW business which does the back office or transportation management systems for companies where you’re actually managing down to the level of the bill of lading. So, the bill of lading is to tell you where the pallet is, we have the GPS, to know where the vehicle is. And to be able to manage that fleet, we just recently acquired 10-4 Systems, which drives capabilities into shipper visibility or shipment visibility. Putting these pieces together, we think gives us unique insight into the market. And so, the play with Blockchain for us would be, think of full lifecycle transactional processing. So, think Smart Contracts, I think freight bids and we are one of the charter members of Blockchain of alliance and trucking -- Blockchain in Trucking Alliance. And we feel pretty good about the early work that we’re doing in this -- with this space.
James Faucette: Great. And then, just a couple of business cycle and seasonal related questions, quickly. First, are you seeing faster cycles related to the ELD mandate and do you expect those then to change or normalize next year? And then, second question is similar as it relates to agriculture, entering the winter months and crop prices being where they are, how are you expecting that segment to develop late this year and then into next year? Just wondering any color or...
Steve Berglund: I’ll start with ELD. So, in December of this year, the easy way to think about it is, you have to be either AOBRD or ELD client. AOBRD is an Automatic Onboard Recording Device. If you’re AOBRD compliant in December of this year, you have an additional two years until December of 2019 to become fully ELD compliant. So, we have seen throughout the year record amount of backlog and bookings coming in to the PeopleNet business, which is the business that has the most positive impact from the ELD mandate. What I would also want you to hear is that it’s not a cliff of demand that happens, starting in January because of this additional two-year window to go full ELD compliant. So, yes, we do have growth that’s been going up on a linear, maybe almost non-linear basis throughout the year, but we don’t expect that to fall off a cliff next year, maybe different next year, but it won’t go away because of that additional cycle and in addition because of the broader product offering between things like video and the OEM work that we do. So that’s the view on ELD. As it relates to ag and I think you said as we’re in the harvest season and coming into winter before too long, I mean, some level the die is cast on the harvesting and the crop prices. What we see at a macro level is stability and farm income, so that’d be one of the indicators we look at which means some of the input prices have stabilized. And so, it’s not that farm income has suddenly exploded or gone up, it’s just that it’s not continued to go down. And so, the stabilization of farm income is a net positive for us in our view. And then, if you look as well at let’s say, used machinery prices, the used market appears to have an -- inflected at this point, which is a positive sign as well. So, I’m not sure James that that’s the question you had on ag.
James Faucette: That’s actually exactly it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: The operating margins on the Building and Infrastructure segment is making nice improvement. Could you talk a little bit about the cadence for ongoing improvement as we go forward, to the balance of this year and into next year?
Rob Painter: Sure. And I would agree, the business leaders are doing a nice job with operating leverage in addition to the revenue growth here over the last quarters. As we move forward, I mean, one of the things to put that into context is we have been talking for quite a while now about the operating margin expectations for the company overall. Getting Buildings and Infrastructure back to the let’s say the company average, it had been below the company average, getting Buildings and Infrastructure towards and at or above the Company average is of course is a big deal to the overall company model. So, as we move in -- and when I talk specifically to Q3, one of the drivers of that delta is up over couple of hundred basis points year-over-year, was the mix. And so, we did have a higher proportion of the software business growth in the quarter, which helped that margin improvement. So, in addition to operating leverage, let’s call that a function of cost management and we also had gross margin improvement, that gross margin improvement was driven a decent amount by the software mix. As we move forward, and let’s say into the balance of the year, we’d expect a similar profile in terms of margin growth and off leverage in the business. And then, if you turn the page and let’s move into 2018 while we are not yet guiding 2018, the notion of managing the operating leverage and in a 25% to 35% range is still very much affordable model. And so, I would expect Buildings and Infrastructure to conform within that range as we think about planning and managing the business.
Colin Rusch: Okay, thank you. And then, just in terms of divestitures. Can you talk a little bit about any areas where you are looking to lighten up the portfolio at all. Obviously it may be premature, but is there -- are there areas that you are targeting or can you talk about any detail around that?
Rob Painter: Hey, Colin, I would say that’s premature.
Colin Rusch: Okay, great. And then, just a final one. The delta between pro forma and GAAP tax rate, can you just help us understand what’s driving that in a little bit more detail?
Rob Painter: Yes. So, you’ve seen that in Q3 and you will also see that if you look forward into the Q4 expectation of a delta and the tax rate. There was an accounting change that went into effect this year that changed where -- essentially how the stock option compensation is treated or stock compensation, it’s not just a option, [indiscernible] so rather than flowing just through the balance sheet, there is also a P&L impact. So, what you would see this quarter as well as in Q4 is we have a number of RSUs that will last and the stock prices going up. And so, when you compare the price of the stock, when the RSUs were granted versus where the stock price is now that they are investing, the stock price has obviously gone up. That creates a further tax benefit, that brings -- that has the impact of bringing that tax rate down on a GAAP basis. So, this accounting is a new accounting, that’s gone into effect to show this on the P&L that started at the beginning of this year. So, what I would expect therefore on an ongoing basis is that the GAAP tax rate will have more volatility quarter to quarter and ergo, the non-GAAP tax rate and why we use it. 
Operator: We do have a follow-up question from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Great, thank you for taking the follow-up. I’m wondering if you folks can talk about on the excavator machine control product lines. What regions is that probably available at SITECH dealers and over what time frame do you expect production to ramp up? Can you just lay that out for us, maybe if you want to use the bulldozer comparable machine controls as a proxy for rollout just to frame where we’re in that process?
Rob Painter: Sure. I would think of it, kind of three -- let’s say two-fold, machine type as well as geography. From a machine type perspective, we make kits that our technology on to variety of manufacturer models of excavators. So, whether it’s the manufacturer or the tonnage of that excavator, there is different let’s say kit that’s required to install the technology. So, I would call this early innings on the kit, the size of the kit, so the number of machines that we’re touching. And that’s one of the reasons, and Steve’s commentary that we see some buoyancy in terms of further upside in this. So, the early reaction we’ve gotten in the market, that should really apply to a small subset of the machine, the available machine. So, as the additional machines come on board, that’s obviously a very good thing for us. So, from a geographic perspective and how it relates to our global SITECH network, we do have a bit of a regional approach to the rollout. The nature of the work is actually done region to region can be very different, so how contractors use an excavator in the Nordics is different than how they use them in Asia, it’s different than how they use them in North America. So there’s intersection between the software, both application and embedded software. And the hardware is a pretty important factor. So, what we’ve seen is that really North America has been the primary geography that has had the uptake on the new product line. And the next region that we would expect to see come on line is Europe, because in Europe, they’re using excavators for many more applications than we use in let’s say in North America where we may be using a dozer or grader, an excavator, or separate machines you’ll see sometimes in Europe, especially maybe in Northern Europe that the excavator is let’s call multi-tool machine. And so there’s a level of software capability we’ll add to that for Europe as that comes online that becomes more attractive for European contractors to take on the technology.
Jerry Revich: I appreciate the color. And I’m wondering, Steve, can you expand on your prior comments on autonomous ecosystem, obviously the solution is going to be different depending on the market, but how do you see Trimble’s position compared to some of the automotive, higher volume applications? So, where do you folks see the Trimble key competitive position versus where are you going to be buying things like sensors and other off the shelf products from folks that are higher volume producers? Can you just frame the landscape for us as you see it?
Steve Berglund: Yes. From our standpoint, it is a relatively confused landscape, because I think there are multiple plays from a Trimble perspective. So, first of all, starting with the high volume, the automotive standard world. We are working actually with a number of automotive focused providers. Now, the relative focus -- it’s not the exclusive focus, but the relatively major focus there is that really over the last - fairly late in the game, called over the last 18 months or so. Precision GPS or precision GNSS more properly has actually become a bigger factor in the solution set. It’s not just relative position, it’s absolute position that is part of the solution here. And in terms of providing centimeter level -- potentially a centimeter level accuracy, Trimble actually has significant advantage over many other providers in terms of being able to provide that through space based signals or otherwise. So, I think that there is a play for Trimble in multiple ways at the -- let’s call at the high volume end of the marketplace, but that’s probably the easiest one to point out at this point in time. And then, our interest is relative to autonomous -- increasing automation, I think we’re a little dubious in terms of just when full autonomy will reach some of these markets but let’s call it increasing levels of automation. Certainly in agriculture, there are possibilities there. Again, that may -- full autonomy may not actually be the answer in the medium term, there may be halfway houses, if you will, in terms of increased automation, simply because of some of the physical limitations such as you need to refill the seed bin or the fertilizer bin every 400 acres or so. Okay, that’s not -- that doesn’t mean you can send a machine out to do large fields and leave them alone for a day. So, again, automation is the key there. And then in construction certainly, it’s progressive. Transportation, there is certainly lots speed down there. We’re working on elements of that without being overly specific here. I would just say there, there is a solution for the open highway, then there is final mile problem. The final mile problem is not easy or straight forward and I think it is going to take some work. So, it will be again a progressive sort of thing. So, I would say is that we are not seeing it as the category onto it itself but we see automation and autonomy to be kind of embedded in our existing market position. I suppose the high volume stuff would be perhaps a kind of a new business category for us. Although we’re currently selling GNSS into automotive applications already. In that sense, it would be an extension as opposed to a new category. So, we are approaching in a fairly incremental fashion just because that’s what we think market will -- how the market will actually evolve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Rob Mason from Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: I wanted to circle back, Steve, in discussing your [indiscernible] as one of the major themes. Could you just update us where we are in that process of integrating the various elements, various businesses within that business and when you think that process might be complete? As well as if you have any examples on the adoption side, where we’ve gained some, where you think we’ve gained some traction and adoption of that solution? 
Steve Berglund: Well, again, I think it’s progressive as opposed to kind of digital. There may never be a day when we say we are whole and complete and we’re done relative to it. So, I think that over the last five or six years, we have acquired most of the elements to formulate a complete solution. And I think, there is first of all, two considerations, really one from a products level, the other is from a go-to-market standpoint. And I think from the product perspective, it has been progressive. So, you’ve seen us talk more and more about platforms within the company whether it would be Trimble Connect or Trimble TPaaS. And so I think that increasingly, we’re talking about more integrated product platforms. So, I think there are increasing numbers of examples where okay we’re able to walk into a large account and kind of talk persuasively about the whole set of Trimble capabilities. And then there is the go-to-market aspect, which is really -- really starts with the segmentation of the market. So, we in effect acquired or developed a number of relative product silos over time. I think in terms of specific focus on certain markets such as architecture which is catch-up gave us, mechanical, electrical plumbing market, general contractors and then structural, all of those represent kind of points of products focus. We need to take care of those. But I think in terms of cases of large contractors, there is, call it, go-to-market challenge on our part. For example, we put out a press release about relationship with AECOM sometime ago and that would represent an example where we need to conform to a different pattern than our historical pattern. So, I think the response on go to market varies depending on kind of which market segment and which group of customers we’re talking about. But again, over the last few years, you’ve seen us talk more and more about kind of key account management. We’ve organized more persuasively around the idea of accounts. And you see relative successes such the new Beijing airport and what our other example of airports we’ve announced along the line. So, you’re seeing successes and this is both key accounts but it’s also maybe more generally about capturing large projects, which tends to be the integer value in construction projects more so than kind of account -- than enterprise level relationship. So, I think, again, progressing. I don’t think there is a defined end point, but I think increase -- as we integrate more product level, more from a go to market, I think we’re starting to see examples, whether we can announce them or not.
Rob Mason: Fair enough, that’s helpful. Rob, just a couple of quick questions accounting wise. Did you mention any type of currency impact for fourth quarter revenue?
Rob Painter: We didn’t speak to it but we do expect to see a modest positive in the numbers that were provided from FX.
Rob Mason: Similar to third quarter then?
Rob Painter: Yes.
Rob Mason: And then, have your -- as you wrap up the 606 exercise, have your costs in the fourth quarter --should we assume that those are higher than the third, has there been any change in that? And then, I’m just curious if there is -- any insight you can give as you look forward how implementation adoption of 606 impacts you?
Rob Painter: Relative to the spend, we do see a step-up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And if were to be taking about the third quarter result that you would have, you could see part of that in the corporate on allocated line and the step-up, whether sequential a year -- year to year, you could see some of those additional expenses. And so, we would expect that to play through in Q4, as well and we expect to spend more in Q4 than we did in Q3. So that is, I would say largely as planned. And as I talked about last quarter as well how some of the timing of that goes. In terms of what’s -- I think the other part of your question is what impact might we expect to have when 606 actually goes to play. So, the reporting begins for the Q1 2018 results. So, our Q1 conference call, the first time we actually hear about the results. First start with say that our plan is to do a full retrospective, not a modified approach, but full retrospective. That means our 2016 and 2017 numbers will be represented in a 606 compliant from such that U.S. investors have comparability in investor community and comparability of the 2018 number versus 2017 number. And then, getting to the heart of the question is, we don’t expect it to have a fundamental shift in the majority of Trimble’s revenue and I think that’s sort of the punch line and the people are looking for. We do expect to have subset of the revenue that will change and the same actually holds true for some of the direct costs to obtain customer contract. So, some costs will come in, some costs will go out. And so, when you think about -- if I go back to the revenue, as you would see in 606, you would see such items such as term licenses that would be recognized, upfront as opposed to over time like they are today. We would see some of the projects or services implementation work we do. That will likely be recognized on a percent complete basis as opposed to at the end of contract completion. That would have the impact of moving -- potentially moving some revenue forward. And so, you have all these different revenue streams that move around. But really, it’s a slice of our revenue that’s impacted, not every single dollar of revenue in Trimble. And therefore, we don’t see a fundamental shift in the majority of our revenue.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you, Mr. Michael Leyba.
Michael Leyba: Thank you, Jona, and thank you, everyone for attending today’s call. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you everyone for your time. You may now disconnect.

Mr. Michael Leyba, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Michael Leyba - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Amanda. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter and our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Good afternoon. Our second quarter results reflected acceleration in our progression of the last year and a half and January did the best organic revenue growth since the second quarter of 2014. The reported revenue growth was 8.6% for the quarter and underlying organic growth was up over 9% without M&A and year-to-year exchange effects. This rebound has taken place without a recovery in agricultural and oil prices and reflects the portfolio changes, which have lessened our exposure to these two effects. In addition to top line buoyancy, the quarter also demonstrated continuing control of the model with operating leverage of 42% for the quarter and 50% for the last 12 months. The better than expected performance provides validation of our earlier commentary for second half revenue growth, which is for strong single-digit organic growth with 5 or more points of additional inorganic growth. The international market outlook remains generally favorable with some regional markets continuing to run hot. South American growth continues to be very robust driven by agricultural demand in Brazil and Argentina. Although, European Geospatial revenue was down, the remaining segments in aggregate grew double digits in the region in spite of year-to-year currency headwinds. Asia Pacific's revenue growth slowed in the quarter from the prior quarter, although Buildings and Infrastructure was up double digits. The Middle East continues to be generally difficult with Geospatial down in the quarter and Buildings and Infrastructure up double digits. North American growth accelerated in the quarter on the strength of Transportation revenues, although Mexico continues to face challenges, presumably at least in part because of U.S. induced policy uncertainty. The environment in the U.S. remains relatively uncertain while awaiting policy outcomes on infrastructure spend, tax reform, and trade policy. Any positive news in these categories would represent a potential net upside to the forecast. Expectations across the company segments remain generally upbeat both in terms of short and long-term revenue potential and competitive positioning. Second quarter performance in the Buildings and Infrastructure segment exceeded our expectations and provided strong operating leverage with much of the revenue strength in the civil engineering business. This relative strength has been highlighted by the recent announcements and new OEM deals with Sumitomo, Komatsu and Yutong. While our current focus remains the end user, OEMs are an important element of our strategy as they provide machine platforms, which can be integrated into our information ecosystem. The Resources and Utilities segment reflected healthy performance, particularly against the standard of the last two to three years, which have been dominated by the commodity pricing cycle. Agriculture, positioning services and forestry, all provided upside momentum in the quarter. The agriculture business produced its best quarter since 2014 based in part and involved improvement in the North American market, the continued strong growth in Brazil and Argentina and OEM performance. The Müller acquisition early in the third quarter provide significant leverage and will be a central element in our variable rate application strategy, which is the next evolutionary step in using the combination of position and agricultural data to provide tangible benefits in the field. Müller's historical focus has been on bringing intelligence into the farm implement and enabling it to operate seamlessly with other elements of the machine and information system. We anticipate that with the growing importance of the implement, the tractor will no longer automatically hold an exclusive central position as the source of intelligence and control within the total precision farming solution. Müller provides Trimble with two additional advantages. First, it brings with it a lengthy list of existing OEM relationships, and second, its existing strong European presence is complementary and that it provides a platform to bring existing Trimble products more aggressively into Europe as well as allowing Trimble to take Müller products worldwide. The other notable actions within Resources and Utilities during the quarter were the revamp of Brazilian agricultural distribution, which is focused on improving market penetration, the acquisition of BOS in Forestry and the acquisition of the NM Group to augment our position in electrical utilities. Transportation segment revenue was strong during the quarter and is expected to continue to remain healthy for the rest of the year. North American growth continues to be robust and was supplemented by growth in Europe and India. The U.S. ELD mandate which has driven significant activity in the U.S. has been a recent topic in Congress with some resulting uncertainty on the circumstances of the mandate implementation. Whatever the resolution, we do not expect it to materially impact our 2017 results. We did recently supplement our ability to effectively meet the needs of the mandate as well as generally improve our electronic volume capability for smaller fleets with the acquisition of ISE. Reported Geospatial segment revenue grew year-to-year for the first time since 2014. The SX10 product, our scanning total station, which was released in the fourth quarter, has redefined the product category and is a market hit without an effective competitive response. We left the quarter with significant backlog for the product and are continuing to ramp up manufacturing to meet the demand. Businesses within the segment are also benefiting from increased investments in autonomy, which require both precise positioning and better maps. This trend has benefited our Applanix business, which has demonstrated significant revenue and profit growth year-to-year. Before I turn the call over to Rob, let me define our current context. The quarter's results confirm that we have transitioned out of a two to three year period, which was dominated by declines in the price of oil and agricultural commodities and the resulting impact on demand, in our agriculture and Geospatial businesses, both of which are significant and profitable elements of the portfolio. We have now successfully reestablished a new normal for Trimble without reliance on a meaningful recovery and commodity price points. The return to a level of normalcy has reinforced confidence, for both the rest of 2017 as well as the multiyear strategic outlook. We believe that our markets continue to provide us with rich opportunities, consisting of substantial unsolved problems, which can be solved through innovation. Let me provide one representative reference point in the Transportation segment and which we expect to have more to say. Our historical emphasis in Transportation has been on managing the truck and the fleet. Recently, we have placed some additional emphasis on the driver community. Perhaps the most significant unsolved and as yet inadequately addressed problem in the industry relates to demand in capacity management and the current level of utilization of long-haul trucking assets. A key missing element that prevents the participants in the industry from achieving better collaboration has affected visibility in the individual shipments. Trimble's existing set of transportation assets provides us with many of the information elements to solve this problem and our ambition is to build out these elements to achieve the complete solution. Beyond the cases like this in Transportation, we have parallel, unsolved problem opportunities in other segments in which we anticipate playing a defining role. Our improved financial model allows us to place increased emphasis on discrete organic growth initiatives, some of which we have described in prior calls. We believe these actions create a robust growth platform that will produce into 2018 and beyond. We also continue to believe that we have the ability to capture significant network effects and create complete solution sets in our vertical markets through targeted profitable acquisitions, which will augment our core organic growth efforts. Let me turn the call over to Rob.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start on slide 5. Our second quarter results came in ahead of expectations with top line and bottom line results meeting or exceeding expectations in all of our reporting segments. Second quarter total revenue was $662 million, up 8.6% year-over-year. Within that, currency translation subtracted approximately 1%, and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures was approximately neutral for a total subtraction of approximately 1%. Organic growth was over 9%. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margins were 55.7%, down 20 basis points based on product mix on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP operating income margin of 18.3% represented a year-over-year improvement of 210 basis points, exceeding our expectations and reflecting the effects of revenue growth, cost control and operating leverage. Second quarter non-GAAP net income was up 30% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.38, up $0.09 or 31% year-over-year. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, please turn to slide 6. Deferred revenue increased 8% to $341 million. Operating cash flow increased 80% to $146 million, reflecting increases in net income and timing of working capital requirements. Net working capital, defined as accounts receivable plus inventory minus payables, accrued compensation and deferred revenue, now stands at 3% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. We finished the quarter with $486 million of cash and short-term investments and our gross debt level at the end of the second quarter was $612 million, giving us ample flexibility from a capital allocation perspective. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate declined from 24% to 23% year-over-year, reflecting geographic income mix. Turning now to review the reporting segments, as a reminder, we re-segmented our reporting in the first quarter. I'll provide some of that overview throughout the second quarter commentary. Let's start with Buildings and Infrastructure on slide 7. Segment revenue was up approximately 10% year-over-year with currency translation subtracting over 1% and acquisitions and divestitures providing a positive effect of less than 1%. The buildings aspect of the segment largely reflects design, build and operate activities in vertical building construction and real estate management. The infrastructure aspect reflects our work in civil engineering with largely horizontal construction. The building construction business was up single digits for the quarter against a relatively strong comp from the second quarter of 2016. Within building construction, we saw growth across our architecture and design, mechanical, electrical and plumbing and structural engineering businesses. Our civil engineering and construction business grew double digits in the quarter with especially strong growth outside of North America in markets such as Japan and China. The impact of growth in cost control enabled us to expand operating margins 340 basis points to 22.6%. It is worth noting that a meaningful amount of additional financial performance comes from our 50-50 joint ventures with Nikon, Hilti and Caterpillar, which fall below the line in non-operating income and are therefore not represented in segment results. Equity income in the quarter was almost $10 million, the majority of which correlates to our JVs in the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment. On a trailing 12-month basis, equity income represents approximately $23 million. Moving to the Geospatial segment on slide 8. Revenue was up approximately 1% year-over-year with currency translation subtracting less than 1% and acquisitions and divestitures subtracting over 3%, for total subtractions of about 4%. Total revenue was up in the segment for the first time in 10 quarters and organic revenue was positive for the second quarter in a row. Within the segment, our core Trimble-branded business for optical and GNSS equipment posted growth, including growth in the North American market. Although the level of oil and gas activity in North America remains well below the level seen in prior years, small increases in activity along with construction activity in general has helped bring stabilization and signs of growth to our Geospatial business. These revenue trends in combination with cost control enabled us to expand operating margins by 90 basis points year-over-year to 18.3%. Next, turning to Resources and Utilities on slide 9. Segment revenue was up 12% year-over-year, with currency translation subtracting approximately 1% and acquisitions and divestitures providing a positive effect of about 2%. In Resources and Utilities, our agriculture business represents the majority of the segment. Our agriculture business includes hardware, such as manual and automatic guidance, variable rate flow controls and pivot irrigation. Our software solutions span from food traceability to agronomic services to farm management. Overall, we continue to experience healthy growth in markets such as Europe, Russia and Brazil, which reflect both penetration and currency dynamics. In the United States, we were encouraged by another quarter of positive growth. Farmers appear to be motivated to look at precision ag solutions despite continued tough macro conditions. We also continue to see growth across our key OEM partners. And gentle to agriculture, our correction services business posted double-digit growth in the quarter. Trimble correction services provides a range of accuracy, specific to the application needs of our customers, whether that'd be sub-inch or sub-meter. The majority of our correction services' customers are farmers who need this accuracy for their work. These services provide recurring and growing revenue streams and leveraged on the Trimble's unique technology that we have developed over decades. To sum up growth, cost control and gross margin expansion allowed us to expand margins 120 basis points to 31.4% on a year-over-year basis. Turning to the Transportation reporting segment on slide 10, revenue was up over 13% year-over-year with currency translation subtracting less than 1% and acquisitions adding approximately 1%. Our Transportation business is dominated by what we refer to as transportation and logistics, which provides mobility, enterprise and mapping, routing and navigation solutions for the trucking industry. Mobility covers on-vehicle technologies and is the part of the business that has been benefiting from the forthcoming ELD regulations in North America, along with other growth initiatives such as video and OEM sales. Enterprise covers ERP-centric solutions for mid-to-large asset-based and non-asset-based carriers. And mapping, routing and navigation covers trucking industry specific solutions for these technologies. Growth in the segment was largely concentrated in North America as the majority of the business is in North America today. We also saw growth in Europe and India. Revenue growth in combination with cost control enabled the expansion of operating margins, which increased 190 basis points to 16.1%. We expect strong operating margin expansion for the remainder of the year in this segment. Next, slide 11. By geography, our revenue mix for the quarter was 55% from North America, 24% from Europe, 14% from Asia Pacific and 7% from Rest of World. North America was up 10% year-over-year. Within North America, revenue in the U.S. and Canada were up with a positive inflection during the second quarter and particularly in the U.S., while revenue in Mexico was down. All four segments experienced growth in North America with strong growth in Transportation. Europe was up 6% in the second quarter and excluding currency translation would have been a few points higher. Growth is relatively broad-based and led by markets including Germany, France, Finland and Norway. Russia continued to improve and the UK grew even after negative currency effects. Asia Pacific revenue was up 2% in the quarter with some offsetting influences. Growth was strong in Buildings and Infrastructure with Japan, Australia, and India leading the way. The Geospatial segment was down slightly, due primarily to the timing of sales in our component business and the Resources and Utilities segment was down primarily due to timing of orders within our agriculture business in Australia. Lastly, Rest of World was up 19%, driven primarily by strong growth in the Resources and Utilities segment in Brazil and Argentina and offset by markets, such as the Middle East. Moving now to slide 12 and our revenue mix. Software, services and recurring revenue streams continue to grow in absolute dollar terms across the company. As a percentage of total company revenue, software, services and recurring streams represented 48% of our revenue for the trailing 12 months, flat as a percentage of revenue with respect to the comparable prior period, while recurring revenue represented 29% of company revenue for the last 12 months, 100 basis points higher than the comparable prior period. We view the relatively steady percentages on our revenue mix as a positive dynamic based on the reinvigorated growth in hardware in areas such as agriculture, civil construction and transportation. This combined hardware revenue comes in at slightly our lower level of margins than the respective segment averages, which bridges the 20-basis point decline in company gross margins. We have no concern here. Turning to slide 13, we have stepped up our acquisition activity of late. With the strategic foundations we have in place, we see the opportunity to capture network effects and build stronger franchises in our existing verticals through targeted accretive acquisitions. This slide provides the summary of those acquisitions, the timing and the strategic rationale. As Steve mentioned, we closed the Müller acquisition at the beginning of July. So while that acquisition does not show up in our second quarter results, it will have a material impact in our third quarter financials. Let's now move to third quarter guidance on slide 14. We expect our third quarter revenue to be between $645 million and $675 million and non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.38 per share. Two comments on the top line growth. First, the midpoint of the range implies 13% year-over-year revenue growth, which includes approximately $30 million or 5 percentage points from acquisitions in our Resources and Utilities and Transportation reporting segment. Second, after a long period of negative FX effects on the top line, we also expect to see neutral to slightly positive top line effects assuming current rates. Three comments on profitability. First, as a baseline, we expect the non-GAAP organic operating margins to be in the same range as last year's 19%, which was a strong quarter driven by the resumption of growth compared to the significant cost reduction. Second, we expect recent acquisitions to dilute overall company operating margins by more than 100 basis points in the quarter and to be slightly dilutive to EPS. The M&A margin and EPS drag is expected to be temporary as it is caused primarily by the first quarter of the Müller acquisition occurring during a seasonal low period in addition to cumulative accounting effects from our recent acquisition. Third, on our first quarter call, we discussed our expected spend to comply with the ASC 606 revenue recognition changes that go into effect in 2018. Our work is progressing, yet the pattern of spend is proving to be more back-end loaded in the year than linear. The spending will drop off significantly in 2018. Next, as a reminder, we provide guidance only for closed acquisitions. While our short-term optics can be skewed by accounting impacts, we are confident that we are creating significant near-term and long-term shareholder value through our acquisitions, which are helping us both strengthen our competitive position and capture unique market opportunities. Let me close by looking out further into the fourth quarter. We anticipate a continuation of revenue growth and a rebound in operating leverage above our normal 25% threshold. While we expect the incremental spend on the ASC 606 compliance to extend a few more quarters, we have visibility to our recently acquired companies transitioning to profitability in the fourth quarter due to positive shifts in seasonality and we therefore expect continued year-over-year operating margin expansion as we enter 2018. Let's now take your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open, sir.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to start with the opportunity that you may be see with Sumitomo, Komatsu and maybe if you could just give us a sense of magnitude as well as timing for those relationships?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. So I really don't want to kind of disclose more than that which was in the press release as that would be inappropriate. So want to stay pretty centered on what we've already said. So I don't think we're able to really speak to dollars and such. I think the more important aspect that we see at this point in time. So the dollars are going to be incremental here in the next 12 months, but not to the point where they're going to significantly move the needle for the company. But I think that these announcements together with those announcements in the past six to nine months or so combined with those that haven't been press-released kind of do represent maybe a strategic picture of starting to evolve an information ecosystem that involves many, if not most, of the machine manufacturers, around kind of what's called a Trimble-centered information scheme whereby, which really we've been talking about for many years in terms of the mixed fleet solution. So, the solution for the contractor in this case is not centered around any particular manufacturer of equipment, but really is able to absorb all the different colors and machines into one information scheme. So I would say as the numbers being generated out of the OEM relationship are nice not needle moving and the greater significance over time is the fact that it provides a basis to sell aftermarket information solutions into the mixed fleet environment. Rob, do you have any other clarification?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: What I would add is what you see with Sumitomo is it relationships on for factory fit for excavators, Yutong is dynamic compaction and the Komatsu deal is a cloud-to-cloud based collaboration. So it also demonstrates let's say, a breadth and depth of relationships in types of machines and capabilities.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the macro environment, can you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of whether we've maybe hit an inflection point here and where the macro could serve as potentially more of a tailwind. I know you said that you can execute in a neutral environment, but do you feel like it's going to potentially be a benefit going forward, just given what you're seeing?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, I think, yes, in general. It's all relative, of course, so against the standard here of last several years. I think there are more positive points of light, if you will, to point out internationally I think we talked in terms of kind of generally being better or upbeat with the probable exception of the Middle East. I think the U.S. is still something of the mystery factor here, which is it's positive. But still with a fair amount of uncertainty around the edges just in terms of what the policy standard is going to be. So I would say, yes, against a relative standard over the last several years, I would say that – I would tend to say generally more upbeat and yes we can call it a trend – an inflection point. But I'm not sure what – I wouldn't want to necessarily forecast the slope after the inflection point.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hey, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm wondering if you could talk about in heavy civil, when do you expect the excavator machine controls product to be fully available across SITECH dealers globally and for the dealers where it's been rolled out, what's been the customer take rate of that product compared to dozers which have obviously been in the market longer?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes, let's start with the latter, yes, from a takeaway perspective, we're very early in the game. So, excavators being the largest machine count population, provides the backdrop for and what we believe is a very attractive machine opportunity, though it's still very, very early let's say in the game with the new earthworks product line for excavators. From a global rollout perspective, we're reasonably far along with that and in the coming quarters we'll be fully distributed as well as have additional firmware capabilities that will come into the product line shortly. So, I think we're in a good position there.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm sorry, Rob, just to clarify, so this year, by the end of the year, you're going to be fully rolled out globally?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes, we're close enough to full.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you. And then you had spoken about the transportation telematics solution gaining traction in Europe. Can you talk about whether that's penetration rates rising or is that you folks gaining share and just flush out for us how much momentum do you think that has behind the better performance this quarter that you pointed out in the slide deck?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: I'll start with, I'd say execution from the business team in Europe. We acquired a couple of companies over the last few years and we think that we've got a differentiated offering on the back of this acquisition and they've just been performing pretty well, really be the essence of it. So I call it more of a – I'll probably call it 50/50 penetration in market share gain.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Couple of quick ones. You highlighted recent acquisitions. You haven't done that recently. Is it reflecting sort of renewed vigor around that strategy and are you sort of also making a statement here that you really saw focus on the smaller tuck-in acquisitions rather than transformative larger acquisitions at this time?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yes, so I think the – if you're detecting a change in tone, there probably is one kind of during the period of 2015 and into 2016 I think that we did kind of consciously return to a, let's mind the netting and let's just make sure that we got our operational cost in order, let's clean up the portfolio to some extent just to make sure that it is central to a strategic concept. So I think without making a big deal of it, one way or the other, I think we did kind of focus more on operations than looking to the outside world. So I think that with the progression that we've shown for really now year-and-a-half, I think we're comfortable that we have control of ourselves operationally and yes, really started to study the strategic equations out there. So, I think, that acquisition let's call focused on careful acquisition is maybe more visibly part of the strategy or the strategic statement than it would have been a year ago. As far as relative size of acquisitions, I think again it is ultimately constrained by what is available in terms of assets, if we're staying focused on the strategy, what is available in terms of size and somewhat limited just given the markets that we're in. There are some big possibilities out there that may or may not make sense for us. So I would not necessarily characterize it so much in terms of size. Certainly this year the characteristic by and large has been in the tuck-ins, but I wouldn't necessarily want to constrain ourselves to kind of that particular definition. If you look to the past, look to PeopleNet, TMW, Tekla, all of which have been relatively transformative for us, so I think that if we came across assets of that quality and that have that kind of transformative capability or capacity for us, we wouldn't shy away from them. So, I'm not sure that I'm necessarily categorically answering your question, but I think it will – the answer is it depends.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. It feels like, Trimble is back on a prior path, on a good path as well. The other thing is, obviously there's an element of uncertainty around Hexagon at the moment, not around their business it seems, but around the leadership and strategic outcome might be interesting there. Are you seeing any change in behavior in any of the OEMs in Europe that you kind of compete with and go up against Hexagon?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, in terms of the implication of the question, I'm going to choose not to infer anything from it. But I think that we are definitely seeing success with OEMs. I think we're seeing relative success versus the competition. I would not – I would just say that we're winning on the merits and leave it at that.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then my last question and maybe, Rob, you can help out here. Are you able to identify the software revenues in the quarter that were unattached, unrelated to hardware, unrelated to the T&L service – subscription service? In other words, pure licensing of the software platform.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: You mean on a dollar basis or a growth basis?
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Or as a percentage basis. Whatever makes sense for you, if it's even possible?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. Off the top of my head, I don't have that available, because just by the dynamics of it, if you take a business – well, actually I guess if you took the delta between the total software, services and recurring and just the recurring line, you would be at around 19%, 20%. I mean that would be – is generally a straight up software sale. And when you get into the recurring, we'd look at business, like on the mobility side, on the fleet management side, where there is the onboard computer that attaches to a subscription. So, I would call that a total solution that 20% plus or minus is the...
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi, this is Kristen on for Colin. Thank you for taking our questions. Just a couple for us. Clearly, we've seen things stalling out in Washington as far as a major infrastructure spending bill, but what we've seen is some action at the state level, particularly with gas tax increases. I think we've seen six states increase that this year. Can you maybe detail for us what impact that's had for Trimble and what the timing of that (36:08) has been for you guys?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. So I think what you'll get from us is a relatively generalized answer that probably does not lead to dollars and cents impact on Trimble. So we would agree that the states have put increased emphasis on solving their own problems and not waiting for the federal government to provide the funding for it. There are discrete examples across the country where that's happening. At the same time, I wouldn't totally discount the possibilities at the federal level. Yes, right now, it is stalled, but I would say that there is a strong sentiment both within the Department of Transportation as well as Congress that if there is an infrastructure spending bill, I think there is a strong motivation to spend it, smarter than has been the case historically. And I think there is a strong appetite for including kind of a technology element in whatever is spent just to make sure that it is being spent efficiently with the minimum amount of waste. But I would say is, yes, the number, not a huge number, not the majority, but a meaningful number of states are stepping up their level of activity. We, as a result, as a company, are spending more time engaged both in Washington and at the state level in terms of both understanding where things are going, but then also trying to influence the spending towards, let's call it, smart spending with a greater technology component. Now, I think, we would – we really don't have the ability to kind of forecast what sort of dollars and cents impact it would have on us. But I would say, if – again, just looking at the trend line, it's probably more positive today than it would have been six months ago. Well, six months ago was maybe euphoric, because of the view that there was going to be $1 trillion spend. So the environment was euphoric with no data behind it. So maybe there has been a downtick there, but probably with more real activity going on, but I would say, we're probably in kind of an upward cycle, just in terms of kind of the willingness for the states to engage on the issue.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on the OEM question. I understand it's still too early to talk about any real needle moving activity with Komatsu or Sumitomo. But you do have a relationship that is about a year old now, I think with PACCAR. Is there anything that you could speak to, to quantify the benefits that you've seen or the take rates that you've seen in the aftermarket from that relationship?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So the – as I think we've previously discussed, the PACCAR OEM relationship in our Transportation reporting segment, that's the first OEM relationship we've had in that business, unlike agriculture or the heavy civil business, where we have long histories of OEM relationships. It's one that has been, we feel it's been successful thus far, the rollout has actually exceeded our original expectations in terms of what's coming out of the factory. That's part one of two, so part one of two is what comes out of the factory. And then the second part is driving let's call it aftermarket, upsell, subscriptions and that part of the business has been, I would say, close to our expectations. And I think we're still early, we wouldn't – it'd be too early to call something a success or a failure in terms of driving the aftermarket adoption. But to give you an anecdote of example where we see a positive benefit of this is if you're a trucking company and you bought a let's say a PACCAR truck and let's say it's got a Cummins engine that comes with that truck. And if I – if the rest of my fleet already has people in that technology, Trimble people in that technology, on day one immediately able to integrate that in with the bigger fleet management solution I have. If you're a customer that doesn't have any technology and now you have a piece of the – let's say, you have a truck that's enabled with technology, that's a – let's call that as a warm lead to talk to that customer about working with them on the rest of their fleet. And then the final example is that they have competitive product there and then start to realize the benefit of having a mix fleet that can connect and that drives sales opportunities for us. And we see in the segment that we focus on that we've been gaining share in these mid to large size trucking fleets. And we believe this is one of many things that's helping us there.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. And if I could just one more in, if I look at your 3Q guidance and back out there I think you said 5 points for M&A, that's still a little bit higher than typical seasonality for you guys. Are you expecting something specific to come through in 3Q or is there anything that we should be looking at?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well I would say, first look at it or think about it on a year-over-year basis as opposed to a sequential basis and so, on a year-over-year basis, put that number in context of what we've been posting in the last few quarters, and it falls in line.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Little bit of follow on to kind of the last questions around growth as you look out through the rest of the year and maybe even some comments for 2018, but, obviously, some acceleration as you've talked about, do you need macro improvements? You've talked about commodity price aspects; grain prices or energy in order to continue to see kind of similar organic growth profiles as you move through the rest of the year and in 2018?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: The answer would be, no. We haven't built the model on a expectation of let's say the U.S. infrastructure bill kicking in any time soon and I know you know ag well and our commodity prices where they are, so don't – haven't built a plan assuming some kind of sudden turn there and the bushel price on corn or soy for that matter. So we've built the model really assuming the let's call it the world as it is today.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then just wanted to talk about some margin as you look at the third quarter guide, incremental margin looks wider than what you've kind of experienced over the past few quarters. Wondering if you can talk to about that?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure, yes. So, I'll try to be careful in the guidance to separate out the organic element versus the inorganic and I think you're zeroing in on the organic element and trying to understand what that leverage looks like to operating performance as well as the leverage within the organic. So, that's the part I'll speak to. And there I'd say couple of things to keep in mind is from a – let's just call it straight comp perspective, it was the second half last year specifically Q3 where we really started to see the benefits of the cost control – cost cutting and cost control and revenue growth kick in sort of driving the leverage. So from a comp perspective, we started to run into that this quarter or as for the last four quarters they were against lower baseline, so that's – so let's call it the starting point as a little bit harder to get to another 40%-plus kind of operating leverage quarter. And second then in addition to that, one of the examples from the script was the ASC, the 606 compliance expenses, which are incremental to what we had last year and that hurts us a bit from it being able to achieve some leverage. So there is meaningful number of points of leverage that are – we'll lose in the quarter, based on the work we're doing on the 606 work and that will go away here in a few quarters. So it's not a structural long-term change.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks, Rob. And then just one last one from me, within ag, what other M&A opportunities do you see in order to build out kind of complementary product offerings like you did with Müller?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: If you think about it from we can take a hardware or a software, services distinction on one hand and then maybe geography on another axis. From a capabilities perspective, as you know, Müller that gets us to the implement, since we think critical and manifestation of precision ag. But to the extent that there is complementary, let's say, technologies around the implement, that's adventurous to us. Now, I'll classify that hardware-centric for the moment. But we also, I would then quickly say there is not really much out in the market, which fits that profile. And then on the software side, software/services side that we see that as a important part of the portfolio is what we have today is very North American-centric. So, as we think about the business obviously being a global business, that's an area where we would look for opportunities that could be geographically-centric, because as workflow can defer from country-to-country, you may need to acquire in order to be able to serve the workflow needs of a given geography. And from a capability perspective, let's just say if I stay on North America or go back to North America, we could look at the value chain, where we have capabilities today and look to either strengthen or fill gaps in that continuum.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Excellent. Thanks, Rob.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera from Needham. Your line is open.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Rob, just comparing the third quarter implied margins versus the second quarter, I mean, basically you have flattish top line revenue, but EPS would be down, I guess, a couple of cents at the midpoint. And just wondering, what would be the pressure quarter-over-quarter in Q3 versus Q2? You mentioned some of the 606 work? Is it also some incremental M&A in there that doesn't have the initial margins that would sort of going run rate?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. So the way to think about it is, if you and sort of I try to bridge here in my script is – so tell me, if it's not answering your question. But from a baseline perspective, I'll start year-over-year, baseline perspective and if I look at the organic operating margin, so exclude the acquisitions, we would see operating income that would – the midpoint would bridge somewhere close to 19% on the operating income line. If the acquisitions which become dilutive to the operating margin, so there is some accounting effects. But there is also some seasonality effects. And so the sum of that on the inorganic side, add that to the organic and I talked about the 606, some of the compliance spend, we have there bridges to the EPS.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. So those are presumably all transient effects of the acquisition and 606...
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Correct.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: ...at some point in time. Anymore you want to say about the kind of longer-term model targets if you have them. Any color at all on how we should think about 2018 versus 2017 from a margin perspective at this point?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So, from a margin perspective as we go into 2018, I would say consistent with the model that we talk about, which is that of generating operating leverage on the revenue growth. So as you play that, if you were to play that forward and look out into 2018 and let's start organic and leave out any let's say new acquisitions that may or may not happen, so we would look to step up the operating income performance of the company and in the environment as it is now, we see revenue growth available. So if the revenue growth is available and we're able to generate operating leverage and call it in mid-20%-plus, then you'll see natural step-ups in the operating margins of the company.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. And I apologize, I did miss the prepared remarks, I was on another call, but, so the Resources and Utilities segment had a real strong quarter with 12% growth there, presumably a good part of that coming from ag. Is there any color you can add there sort of what drove that and how sustainable that is, how much that was easy comps, acquisitions. I think acquisitions are actually fairly minor part of it from your chart here, but any color you can give on the sustainability of that strength in the Resource and Utilities segment? Thank you.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. A couple of comments there. And I would not start with easy comp as a baseline for it, and it's driven twofold; first from the agriculture business and the second from our Trimble correction services business. So from an agriculture perspective, we've seen continuation of good growth outside the U.S., or outside North America. So the Brazils, Russia, the CIS countries, Asia Pacific posted – they continue to post good growth. It's a continuation of what we have been seeing and that what we saw in the U.S. was a quarter of growth in the U.S. and we're going on it at least a couple of quarters now of posting growth in – positive growth in the U.S. And so that's obviously, you add that dynamic into the equation on top of the international that we've already been seeing and you get a good story. And then on top of that, we have had growth with OEM partners which I would call – say it's separate and distinct from geographic growth I was just describing. So, that would be the ag side of the picture and then the complementary side is on our correction services business. So, that's the farmer who needs ubiquitous sub-inch or sub-meter coverage, positional accuracy. To do that, you're subscribing to correction services. A good deal of those correction services subscribers we have are farmers, in fact the vast majority of them are farmers who need their accuracy for their work and that business was up double digit year-over-year and it's a strong profitable SaaS business.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And just one more, if I could on that. You still primarily selling guidance as the main product here. I mean, I guess, there have been some concerns going way back about penetration within kind of the ag guidance market. Just curious if that's – I'm presuming that's still predominantly what you're selling on the ag side, just wanted to clarify that.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. So in Q2, it would still be, let's say, the dominant element of the hardware revenue that we have. We also have variable rate flow controls, water management systems, irrigation systems as well as pivot irrigation. The fundamental change as we go forward, would be Müller coming into the Trimble family as we get into precision ag and really the variable rate flow controls with the Electronic Control Units that Müller has. So think about it as if guidance is very tractor-centric, what comes with Müller is very implement-centric, that's the thing behind the tractor and that's important both strategically. But to your point on penetration also, let's say, balances or diversifies the sources of hardware revenue that we have.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Just one more follow-up, if I could. We mentioned the irrigation, and I know that was a product area that you had tried to launch going back last year and had some sort of fits and starts with the initial launch of irrigation. Is it fair to say, now, you've kind of got the irrigation product in the field and kind of selling the way you wanted it? Has that gotten kind of come along to where you wanted it?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Oh, so, good memory. So, actually the answer on irrigation is, our news in that realm is the OEM agreement with Valley. And Valley will be where we expect to see the irrigation, the pivot irrigation business, really move. Valley being one of the largest providers in the world of pivot irrigation systems, for us solves – or addresses, I should say, addresses a go-to-market challenge/opportunity. So, that's really the move we've made in the irrigation, pivot irrigation side of the business.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much. Nice job, gentlemen.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Just a couple of follow-up questions to some of those that have already been asked. First, I guess, maybe for you, Steve, can you help us understand the financial impact from OEM agreements in Building and Infrastructure, but specifically, I'm wondering how should we think about the mix? Are these the type of agreements where we should expect a traditional type mix of between hardware and software or is it going to move things around meaningfully, one way or another? And then, I guess also from a longer-term perspective, as you're thinking about and you've made mention of doing acquisitions that continue to build out portfolio and where you see a lot of opportunities and the like. How important is it that you look abroad for a lot of these technology type acquisitions or do you think that – and I wonder that for ability to access the markets that they're in. Or do you think that you can still get good leverage from buying wherever you find the best deal into different markets? So, I guess I'm just worrying about – a little bit about political concerns, et cetera. Thanks.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. Yes. So, again, I think, we're taking relatively great pains to try to qualify the OEM opportunity in Building and Infrastructure, which is not so much as an end unto itself, but a means to an end. And so I think that if you really look at the next year or two or three, for that matter, the dollar revenue coming directly from the OEMs is not going to be a topic of a great deal of conversation on our part. It's more the strategic leverage that we're getting really in the aftermarket. So, we really are seeing the OEMs as a means to access the aftermarket is install a box, there are different models here, but in a simplistic way is think about installing a box on the machine in the factory that already has a Trimble layer of intelligence on it, it goes to the aftermarket, ends up in the hands of a contractor, who may have three, four, five different machine types, different colors, different manufacturers. And the concept would be our distribution goes and visits that contractor and effectively sells software and potentially other services on top of the capability represented in the box. So hopefully, if this all works right, is the relatively larger part of the value-add will take place in the aftermarket, will be in the form of software and services, more so than the value implicit in the box in the factory. So again, the revenue is nice, but we all ultimately expect the larger part of the revenue to come from the aftermarket. And to see the box being installed in the factory, kind of maybe a literal box or a virtual box being installed in a factory, being kind of a means to an end, relative the end being the aftermarket revenue. As far as the question on acquisitions in terms of kind of the where we go looking for them, I think that, one, we take a fair amount of pride in being an international company. I think we do view the international market kind of holistically. And so, we would not think in terms of domestic or foreign or domestic and abroad. So, I think that we have demonstrated a fair amount of capability of arbitraging technology sources from around the world, whether it be India or we've got a strong Nordic presence. We have a strong German presence. We have capability in a lot of places around the world. So, I think that we would be in a sense indifferent relative to the nationality associated with acquisitions and would simply look for the best fit, the best value creation capability. And at least at the moment, we're not particularly consumed by kind of geopolitical considerations. That may come. But aside from the obvious places to avoid, we're not really including that very directly into our calculation on acquisitions.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. Your line is open. Rob Mason from Baird, your line is open.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. Wanted to see if you could provide an update on the field service and facility management businesses. How those are tracking relative to what you need to see from those year-to-date and whether they grew in the quarter – second quarter?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. On the facility management, or we call it our real estate and workplace solutions business. The business had a nice second quarter as the punch line. So, within in line and the fact that exceeded our expectations, both in terms of top line, bottom line, but also importantly in the bookings, because the bookings is what's going to show up later as revenue. So, from an operational perspective, as well the businesses materially improved. One of the things that we have talked about in prior, I think that's probably in the last call, was the need to get through a few of discrete implementations and then let's get sign off the customers on some of the discrete implementations, which have been stayed long in the making that potentially gate us from moving to the next customers, and we progressed nicely on that front. So, that's the summary on the real estate and workplace solutions business. And then, in our FSM business or field services management business, we continue to make a, let's call it a somewhat of a strategic pivot in that business. And one of the models that I think has served big company well over many years is that of being very centered – very centric to vertical – serving vertical markets more so than being a horizontal provider of technology, and that's the pivot that continues to be underway in our field services management business. The obvious verticals, given the nature of Trimble is, those in construction and agriculture markets. So a good deal of emphasis continues to write on that.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, is it fair to say that the real estate business is now certainly more on a growth trajectory, more consistent with the overall buildings portfolio?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I got to say it's getting close to that. It doesn't have the growth – top-line growth profile of the rest of buildings. Some of that's very much on purpose, because we really work to address the bottom line in the business. I mean, it's a business that has a long – reasonably long sales cycle and long implementation cycle. So carefully you could get in a position of, let's say, if you're only going after the recognized revenue in the short term, you can do that and it be at the expense of the bottom line, so you have to get that balance with the business model like that. So, we put, I'd say the emphasis on focus on getting the bottom line correct, which has a bit of expense on a bit, comes at a bit of a – let's say, price so to speak on the recognized revenue that would show up with it being on a lower revenue growth than the rest of the portfolio. Going back to what I said on the bookings, very importantly that the bookings do continue to grow and are trending in the right direction. And that's what will get us the revenues that come in line with the growth that we expect out of the rest of that buildings portfolio.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. Just one last question on the – you've commented a couple of times on the assumption, the inorganic margin would have some pressure in the third quarter. Outside of the seasonality at Müller is, do you see that pressure continuing or is past the third quarter on the inorganic part of your business?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: To our potential accounting implications, so, just speaking a more general sense the one that most of the people are familiar with would be the purchase accounting effects or deferred revenue haircut that you often see, in software acquisitions and more and more of our deals are software oriented that none. The second effect, and I wouldn't call this a purchase accounting effect, that can happen on a let's call it a software acquisition, that we've made if we've bought a company that's a private company that may have had a way of recognizing revenue let's say on a professional services contract, and in the past, that would have been let's say call it on a they were mid perhaps recognized at on I'd say time of materials or as performed basis. But in GAAP accounting it's generally, going to take you to the point of having completed the contract. And so, as we bring companies in that are private into a public context, we often have to ship the contracts or ship the nature of how you – what – first it's recognize the revenue under U.S. GAAP and the company had had a prior practice that was different that can cause a shift in ability to actually to recognize the revenue, which is completely separate from collecting a cash and getting the work done that can really, just be accounting effect, which to me is mutually exclusive from a differed revenue haircut on purchase accounting.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And that's in reference to acquisitions and house not the theoretical?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Correct.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: And there is a one, that will then fix themselves quickly, they play pretty quickly, and then you're back on the trajectory.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Michael Leyba, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Michael Leyba - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Alex. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. We're here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter and our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Good afternoon. Our first quarter results represented solid progress and a continuation of a positive momentum from the third and fourth quarters, a stronger revenue growth and significant margin expansion. Revenue, as reported was up 5.3% year-to-year, which translates to underlying core organic growth of over 6.5%, after allowing for acquisition, divestiture and exchange rate effects. This is the highest growth rate we have seen since 2014. Although we continue to feel the cyclical effects from agriculture and oil and gas, increasing growth rate reflects our mitigation efforts in the affected businesses, as well as our focus on alternative growth components in the portfolio. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 17.8%, up 2.7 points from last year, and reflected operating leverage of 67%, which was enabled by tight cost control, which held non-GAAP expenses flat year-to-year. Operating leverage, which has been and will be a central driver of continuing margin expansion was 44% for the last trailing 12-month period. Our full-year 2017 outlook remains basically unchanged from prior commentary and anticipates further step-ups in revenue growth and margin expansion as the year goes on. The expectation for the full year is for single-digit organic growth with a potential boost by a couple of points of acquisition growth. We expect the second half's organic performance to be relatively stronger than the first half. In addition, we expect the effect of acquisitions made during the year to add multiple growth plans in the second half. The international market outlook remains generally favorable with some very hot regional markets. Europe, Asia-Pacific and most other regions are outpacing North American growth. The environment in the U.S. is relatively uncertain, while awaiting policy outcomes on infrastructure spend, tax reform and trade policy. Our forecast has never being to significant impact from increased infrastructure spend and it will represent a potential net upside to the forecast, if it happens. Tax reform is likely to have a positive direct and indirect effects, but with the qualification if it impacts cross-border transactions. Increased trade protectionism would be negative. Given the possibility of increased infrastructure spending, we've stepped up our engagement at the federal level, with the aim of promoting the power of technology to build the infrastructure better, faster and cheaper. We're also increasing our efforts with the 50 States, anticipating that actual spending decisions will be made at that level as well as recognizing that many States have taken the initiative to increase spending, independent of federal actions. Today, is the first time, we have reported using our new segments. The change represents the evolution of our business and our markets and brings better balance to reporting segments, enables improved transparency and better enables us to articulate the Trimble narrative to our investors. We appreciate that this is a change for the analyst and investor community, which has grown accustomed to the segmentation we last adjusted in 2006. Rob will walk you through the details. The second half of 2016 and early 2017, represents a period of strong innovation in Trimble with implications for both short-term and long-term competitive positioning. Let me provide a few examples along with the summary of the status of the segments. The Geospatial segment, net of divestitures and acquisitions grew year-to-year for the first time since 2014. The SX10 product, our scanning total station, which was released in the fourth quarter, has redefined the product category and is a market hit without an effective competitive response. We left the quarter with a strong backlog for the product and are ramping up manufacturing to meet the demand. Businesses within the segment are also benefiting from increased investments in autonomy, which require both precise positioning and better maps. In the Buildings and Infrastructure segment, the recent CONEXPO trade show provided us with an opportunity to showcase both our role at the center of the information ecosystem for the civil engineering market and the advantage of being a provider of hardware and software bundles. Trimble technology had a visible presence in 18 equipment manufacturers' booths. Our presence on these machines provides a platform on which to sell future information solutions. At the show, we announced a number of new solutions with particular emphasis on the new machine-controlled product platform. Part of the inaugural launch was the industry's first integrated 3D aftermarket excavator, which represents a significant step towards greater automation. In the buildings component of the segment, we saw double-digit increases in most of the businesses, including Manhattan Software. In the Resources and Utilities segment, the agriculture business reflected relatively healthy performance, particularly considering that we have not exited the cycle. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Valley Irrigation, that provides us with immediate access to a targeted and well-developed distribution channel for our irrigation technology. The early results have been positive and the increased scalable enable us to intensify our innovation efforts in the irrigation. The Transportation segment produced strong revenue growth in the quarter, with the mobility businesses in U.S., India, and Europe reflecting currency adjusted double-digit growth. Product innovation, together with ELD mandate in U.S. help propel this growth. Our emphasis on focusing on profitable growth platforms continued in the quarter. In the first quarter, we divested our ThingMagic business, which was discussed on the last call. We also divested a small non-core crane lifting system business to focus more aggressively on wireless solutions for cranes. In addition, we have eliminated a number of small manufacturing sites that were acquired through acquisition. We either made or announced a number of small acquisitions in the quarter to extend our information solution franchises for rail and forestry. We closed the transaction for Beena Vision in the Transportation segment in the quarter, which was discussed in the last call. Although we seldom use the Internet of Things terminology, the combination of Beena Vision with our existing rail information capabilities is a real example of the power of the term. The prospects for us in this large market are interesting and early results are encouraging. We also announced three acquisitions in our forestry business within the Resources and Utility segment, which in combination with our existing forestry assets puts us in a unique and central position to redefine the forestry workflow. Our connected forest solutions manage the full raw materials lifecycle of planning, planting, growing, harvesting, transporting and processing. By encompassing the entire workflow, we have the opportunity of eliminating historical points of friction and delivering transformative outcomes. Let me turn the call over to Rob for more detail. In summary, the outlook for 2017 continues to be positive with an opportunity for an increase in the levels of revenue, growth and margin expansion. Our improving financial model provides hope to place increased emphasis on discrete growth initiatives with the aim of building momentum into 2018. Examples include the accelerating conversion of traditional software license models to SaaS models, the continuing investment in Trimble Connect, the development of our data and software capability in agriculture, the development of driver communities and third-party logistics providers in transportation, and the development of autonomy concepts. With the strategic foundations we have in place, we also see the opportunity to capture network effects and to build stronger franchises in our existing verticals through targeted accretive acquisitions. Rob?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide five. Our first quarter results came in ahead of expectations with top line and bottom line results meeting or exceeding expectations in all of our reporting segments. First quarter total revenue was $614 million, up over 5% year-over-year. Within that, currency translations subtracted approximately 1%, and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures subtracted approximately 0.5%, so total subtractions of approximately 1.5%. First quarter gross margins were 56.5%, up 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 17.8%, represented a year-over-year improvement of 270 basis points, well exceeding our baseline expectations and reflecting the compounding effects of revenue growth, gross margin expansion and cost control. First quarter non-GAAP net income was up 31%, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.33, up $0.08 or 32% year-over-year. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, please turn to slide 6. Deferred revenue increased 5% to $337 million. Operating cash flow decreased 10% to $103 million reflecting timing of working capital requirements, particularly accounts receivable. We finished the quarter with $423 million of cash in short-term investments, and our gross debt level at the end of the first quarter was $648 million, leaving us ample dry powder to execute upon our capital allocation strategy. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate declined from 24% to 23%, reflecting favorable geographic income mix. Turning now to segment commentary, let me first set additional context with the re-segmentation. For those of you who follow our investor presentations and meetings, you will note that over – that we've been sharpening the focus of the Trimble story over the last year. Trimble is transforming the way the world works by delivering products and services that connect to physical and digital world. Slide 7 shows a slide from our investor material that's put a visual to this strategy across our largest served industries. Furthermore, this slide shows the four core business franchises that we have been talking about over the last year, geospatial, construction, agriculture and transportation. The slide also identifies a set of emerging industry opportunities that we have been talking about for some time. If you turn to slide 8, this bridges the gap from the old reporting segments to the new reporting segments. A couple of highlights to mention are as follows: Geospatial and construction were basically separated. Construction covers both vertical and horizontal work, which is why we call the segment Buildings and Infrastructure. Our GIS business moved from the former Field Solutions into Geospatial along with elements of the old Advanced Devices reporting segment. Please note that a majority of the company divestitures in the last 15 months have taken place in the new Geospatial reporting segment. Resources and Utilities are still dominated by our agriculture business. In the re-segmentation, our correction services business, and our forestry business have moved together with agriculture, as they have highly complementary strategies and customers. Finally, our Transportation segment combines our on-highway business with the emerging rail business. On our investor website, you will find historical information for the new segment revenue and operating margins going back to 2014. And in the appendix of this earnings presentation, you'll find a table that provides first quarter revenue under the prior reporting segments. Turning now to review of the reporting segments. Let's start with Buildings and Infrastructure on slide 9. Segment revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with currency translation subtracting about 2% and acquisitions and divestitures providing a minor positive effect. The buildings aspect of this segment largely reflects vertical construction and real estate management, ensures our BIM-centric businesses. Infrastructure largely represents horizontal construction work, which we also refer to as civil engineering and construction. The building-centric elements of the business were up double digits for the quarter, a reflection both of the performance of the business as well as a comparison against a relatively weak comp from the first quarter of 2016. Across the board from architecture and design to our estimating design and engineering solutions for MEP and structural trades, all businesses performed well in the quarter, with concentrated strength in North America and Europe. Our civil engineering and construction business grew strongly outside of North America with double-digit increases in markets such as Germany, Japan and Australia. The North American market largely remained in wait-and-see mode. Our new products launched at CONEXPO have been received extremely well in the market, and we are confident about the competitive position we continue to build around this franchise. We continue to progress with OEM deals and thus far in 2017, we announced additional machine relationships with Hitachi, Kobelco, Sumitomo, K-Tec and Yutong. To intersect these announcements with machines and workflows, the Yutong deal is for dynamic compaction, K-Tec is for scrapers, and Kobelco is for excavators. We also announced that cloud-to-cloud connection with Hitachi that enables Trimble Connect to mid workflow data on and off machines. The impact of growth and cost control enabled us to expand our operating margins 450 basis points to 17.4%. It is also worth noting that a meaningful amount of the financial strength from our civil engineering and construction business is absent from operating income. As our 50-50 joint venture with Nikon, and our 50-50 joint ventures with Caterpillar fall below the line in non-operating income. These joint ventures contributed to the year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. Moving to the Geospatial segment on slide 10. Revenue was down 2% year-over-year with currency translation subtracting about 1%, and acquisitions and divestitures subtracting another 3%. Within Geospatial, our core Trimble branded business of optical and GNSS equipment posted slight growth, including growth in the North American market, which we as have discussed in prior calls have suffered from the effects of the low oil prices. While one data point does not represents an inflection, we are encouraged by this performance along with a strong double-digits booking growth driven by demand for the new SX10 product. We have seen some pick up in oil and gas regions such as West Texas and also in a number of state departments of transportation. Another highlight is our Applanix business, which specializes in inertial technologies used for mobile geo-referencing applications, including autonomous driving applications. An area of relative weakness continues in our GIS business, which we have previously discussed. These revenue trends in combination with cost control enabled us to expand operating margins by 150 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%. Next, turning to Resources and Utilities on slide 11, segment revenue was up 5% year-over-year, with currency translation subtracting about 1%, and acquisitions and divestitures providing a minor positive effect. Within Resources and Utilities, our agriculture businesses represents a majority of the segment. Our agriculture businesses were comprised of our well-known guidance technologies from manual to automatic guidance solutions, and also include additional hardware-centric solutions, such as variable rate, flow controls and pivot irrigation. In addition to foreign management solutions, our ag software solutions address food traceability and we also operate a marketplace and trusted source for new and used agricultural and industrial equipment. Overall, we continue to experience healthy growth in markets such as Europe, Russia and Brazil, which reflect both penetration dynamics, as well as currency dislocations. In the United States, we experienced slightly positive growth in the quarter, which was encouraging. Farmers seem to be motivated to look at precision ag solutions, despite continued tough macro conditions. We also achieved growth in our OEM business outside of our important CNH relationship. Tangential to ag, our correction services business posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Trimble correction services provides a range of accuracy, specific to the application needs of our customers whether that be sub-inch or sub-meter. The majority of our correction services' customers are farmers who need this accuracy for their work. We see this business as a growth engine for Trimble, as it provides ubiquitous, absolute positioning for applications beyond the agriculture, such as construction, GIS work, or the general realm of economy, also in Resources and Utilities is our forestry business. Steve mentioned how the acquisitions completed thus far this year have filled in our gaps and now allow us to be able to deliver a true Connected Forest strategy. Slide 15 details out the acquisitions and the strategy. The sum of growth, cost management, and a bit of favorable comps allowed us to expand margins 450 basis points to 35.2%. Note also that the first quarter has, historically, been the highest operating margin within Resources and Utilities segment during any given year. Turning to the Transportation reporting segment on slide 12, revenue was up 9% year-over-year with currency translation subtracting less than 1% and acquisitions adding about 1%. Our Transportation business is dominated by what we refer to as transportation and logistics, which provides mobility, enterprise and mapping, routing and navigation solutions for the trucking industry. Mobility covers on vehicle technologies and is the part of the business that has been benefiting from the forthcoming ELD regulations in North America. Enterprise covers ERP centric solutions for mid-to-large asset-based and non-asset-based carriers. And mapping, routing and navigation covers trucking industry specific solutions for these technologies. Our FSM or field services management business is in this segment, as is our emerging rail business. Growth in this segment was largely concentrated in North America as the majority of the business today is in North America. We also saw growth in Europe and India. Operating margins decreased 70 basis points to 15.9%, offsetting factors to natural operating leverage from revenue growth, included continued investments in discrete new initiatives such as a truck driver community, as well as a reduction in margins driven by larger-than-expected low-margin OEM hardware sales. We expect transportation operating margin expansion through the rest of the year. Next, slide 13, by geography, our revenue mix for the quarter was 53% from North America, 26% from Europe, 14% from Asia-Pacific and 7% from Rest of World. North America was up 3% year-over-year. Within North America, revenue in the U.S., Canada and Mexico were all up. The Transportation segment was up in North America, with a small decline in the other reporting segments. Within the other reporting segments, as mentioned, we had positive moves in product lines such as GNSS, optical, and ag hardware, offset by negative moves in GIS, for example. Europe was up in the first quarter, with solid double-digit growth in markets such as Germany and Russia, even after negative FX effects, offset by a double-digit decline in the UK. Asia-Pacific revenue experienced growth in all, but the Resources and Utilities segment with strong double-digit growth in markets, such as Japan and Korea. Lastly, Rest of World was up strong double-digits, driven by markets such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, and offset by markets, such as the Middle East. Moving now to our revenue mix, slide 14 shows us that our software services and recurring streams represented 48% of our revenue for the year, flat with respect to the prior year while recurring revenue represented 29% of company revenue for the last 12 months, 2 percentage points higher than the comparable prior period, reflecting the outpaced growth of this revenue stream. Growth in hardware revenue over the last 12 months has resulted in an unchanged mix of software services and recurring streams on a year-over-year basis. With that, we now turn to our second quarter guidance. We expect our second quarter revenue to be between $625 million and $655 million, and non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.33 and $0.38 per share. A bit of commentary on the top line growth, we expect our second quarter growth to roughly follow the pattern of year-over-year growth we've experienced over the last three quarters. As for the bottom line, we continue to expect meaningful margin progression on a year-over-year basis. With that, let's now take your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone, or good evening, excuse me. Can you talk about in the Transportation segment, you folks were doing work on rolling out electronic logging devices for low-end applications, for just basic compliance, and I'm wondering if you could update us on where that stands, where those development efforts stand today, and what are the lead times like in the installation of the electronic logging devices broadly, as your customers there work to hit the end of year deadline?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, I'll start maybe with the latter part. Yes, as you said, with the deadline leaning towards the end of the year, that is driving activity with the end-market, and so the backlog on the net business is reflective of the number of companies coming out to implement technology. So that was from a, I call it a, macro perspective, that is the favorable conditions relative to, let's say, deal activity in the market. So we do see that continuing and we have an expectation that that will – activity will tick up through the course of the year as this first deadline comes our way. Relative to the product availability and the launch of the product really targeted at the sweet spot in that – I call it that mid-market. We are on track with the product delivery timeline. So at this point, remain confident that we're well positioned with the right product at the right time.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And, Rob, on the first part of the comment, do you folks – your distribution centers have the head count in place to support the significant ramp in installations or should we look for a period of more OpEx investment for you folks to accommodate the end-user demand heading to year end?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: No, we do not anticipate an increment of OpEx out of the, let's say, out of the norm in order to meet the demand on a delivery doc. So, no, we feel like we're well-positioned at this point. We've had to develop those jobs as it were in the last few quarters as demand has ramped up.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And in your prepared remarks you spoke about rising adoption of precision farming, can you talk about which of your product lines you're most optimistic on adoption within the next 12 to 24 months? What are you seeing outside of the ramp of precision GPS in Europe?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, if you think about it from a – it come out at a product line in a geographic angle. If you think about it from a product perspective, if you look at major segments such as guidance, flow controls, irrigation, water management, we've seen positive movements really in all those business lines, probably particularly in guidance, flow controls and I mean, in irrigation, Steve mentioned the Valley Irrigation partnership announcement we made in Q1. So, yeah, it kind of viewed across the board. From a geographic perspective, we've continued to see outsized growth outside of North America. However, as we said in the prepared remarks, North America did show a positive comp in the first quarter, which was nice to see.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good afternoon. Just a couple questions. Steve, lately, I just want to bounce off you the – we've seen a number of articles about ag production and exports, Rest of World kind of gaining share. And, obviously, can you just address how – is Trimble well positioned globally within those ag markets, obviously, Rest of World, kind of showed up is doing quite well, but I'm just – is the scale – are we positioned to take advantage of the scale of the spend in Rest of the World in our ag business?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, I would – in general, the answer is, I think emphatically, yes. You look at the alternatives to the U.S., sort of the alternatives to North America for that matter. Well, let's say, alternatives to the U.S. plus there is Canada that's basically home turf for us. There is Brazil, which is where we're seeing extremely high growth at this point in time. And we've been established in Brazil for really decades in agriculture, and we're in the process of kind of stepping up our effort in Brazil, in terms of relative density of channel. So, I'd say, Brazil, we have well in hand, there is Australia, which again I would kind of call home turf, a market that we're very comfortable with. So I would say, the dynamics probably revolve around those areas, primarily. Eastern Europe and Russia, again, areas that we're seeing significant growth in at this point in time, maybe relatively recent additions from a channel perspective, but certainly areas where we have feet on the street, where we have distribution, where we have, let's call it, a real understanding of the market. And, I would say, those are probably, kind of the primary players in, let's call it, the arbitrage of agricultural markets, then you get into the peripheral markets like China and others, and I would say, again, we're pretty comfortable in those areas. So, I would say, in general, if the world is arbitrage in kind of the agriculture production, we're capable of going wherever it is.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And those presumably are more aftermarket deployed technology or is our CNH partnership, is that still carrying the flag or just...
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Certainly, the CNH partnership is relevant in most of those areas.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: I would say, the model is very much the same, at least in terms of structure as North America, which is a combination of OEM relationships. And then the number of OEM relationships is increasing at this point in time. With factory set, with the idea that in the longer term that provides a platform on which we can sell software and other products. But, I would say, the structure around the world is quite similar to that in North America, which is a combination of factory set plus aftermarket.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just a quick question, Rob, on the re-segmented revenue and the pieces here, we used to speak to Trimble's opportunity from an adjusted operating margin standpoint is being in the low-20s. And I'm curious, when I look at the re-segmented op margin, on an adjusted basis, Resources and Utilities had a great quarter, 35% that's mostly ag, ag we were trying to manage in the past to 30%, but could you just give us a sense of the opportunity if you want to do three years out or in the four segments in terms of where the adjusted op margin can go?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. As you know, Rick, we don't guide at a segment level, but just to frame it at a high level, working backwards from the company model. I think about it as follows, in the Resources and Utilities, maintaining a margin where we were, let's say, at the end of last year on an annualized basis would be certainly part of the strategies, part of the financial model. I wouldn't – so, yeah, you are right, of course, we're in the 30% range plus or minus, of course, because we do continue to invest in the software business as we have to bring them to scale. If I look at the Transportation business, the clear financial objective as we grow the business is to expand the operating margins to be closer to the company average. And as you do that, you're going to naturally fit the model to get it to our objective there in those low-20s in the long-term. When I think about the Buildings and Infrastructure franchise, also a business that had good growth tailwinds and when we look at the op margins in that, I would call that as a steady increase in operating leverage will increment us to the company model. And, finally, Geospatial, which of the four segments would represent the most mature of the segments. So if I think about the growth rate in Geospatial segment versus the other segments, I would tend to put it lower on the list of the growth in the longer term, all organic when I say this. And then from a margin perspective, trying to kind of, I'd say, maintain or hold somewhere close to where we've been, mix all the pieces, add up to that the company growth – or excuse me, company growth in margin model as we talk about.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. So Geospatial 20% would be a good solid number, and, again, I'm not putting a timeline on it, but that's how that would play out?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Kristen on for Colin. Just wanted to unpack that 270 basis points of margin improvement a little bit, as you mentioned the strong results in three out of the four businesses. Can you maybe help me understand, how much of that is volume leverage versus the structural changes that you've made in the cost of those businesses? And then maybe to that, how much of the impact of the software mix that we're beginning to see at this stage?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure, Kristen, I'll take the question. So from the op margin improvement, well, if I think about from an OpEx standpoint, on an organic basis, our head count is down year-over-year. So there is a clear element of managing the costs that plays out into the margin improvement. In other words, that is the foundation for operating leverage as the revenue grew that over 5%, it's going to naturally fit into that. So it's kind of an all of an integrated answer, because some of the structural, well, structural changes, okay, we could be talking about manufacturing plant consolidations and some of the divestitures, if I call those structural elements, there is a few step up of basis points there. But really the fundamental change or delta would have come from the combination of cost control meets revenue growth equals operating leverage.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And I mean, is there any difference in the geographic mix, I know you talked about penetration rates in the U.S. and Canada, are you seeing that impact, the margin profile on a go-forward basis?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, if I think about a – well, what we see happening from a revenue standpoint is the markets outside of North America are growing faster than North America. So if we can call them Europe, Asia-Pacific, Rest of World posted higher growth rates than the U.S. Where the U.S. to return to growth rates we've seen in the past or something that's approaches growth rates we see in other major regions in the world, that would naturally provide a step up in revenue. And, therefore, operating leverage and therefore margin expansion. That's how I would think about on a regional basis. Relative to your question on penetration, we do believe one other reasons we've seen step ups in markets such as, obvious agriculture is an example, but I could do the same thing with machine control technologies and infrastructure business. As we do see, lower penetration in markets outside of North America, U.S. and Canada specifically, than we see in this market here in the U.S. So there is certainly an element of penetration that comes and at some point in the mix. And I think you also asked about software, and we do see the software portfolio continues to grow faster than the hardware-centric businesses. Now, we would emphatically characterize ourselves as a solutions company, when you breakdown the solutions into the software and hardware elements, with the software outpacing hardware growth, we do see some natural expansion both top and bottom there.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sure. Thank you for that. And I can follow-up with the rest of that offline. One more if I can fit it in. You talked a little bit about having the dry powder now to execute on your capital allocation strategy. Can you just review that allocation strategy for us now that we've seen a little bit more return to M&A this year and anything else you are thinking?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, certainly in the mix of things we look at are, first funding our internal organic growth, our internal research and development is the foundational driver of our organic growth. Next, when we look at M&A possibilities that Steve highlighted at last quarter as well this quarter, that we see a couple of points potential growth from M&A activities and the balance sheet would reflect the ability to do deals, of course prudent deals. Buybacks or our stock buybacks are part of the capital allocation strategy. We did a little under, I think it's under $15 million here in Q1. So that would be the lens by which I think about capital allocation.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thank you very much. I'm wondering, if anybody, Steve, whoever could chime in, I want a little color if you have, and even if it's just anecdotal on the nature of the improvement that you've seen in business around a lot of the world. Just – and I'm really just wondering, do you feel like this is kind of catch up or delayed spending that's now coming through or do you think we're at the early stages of new projects and spend initiatives? I guess, obviously we're encouraged to see finally a response coming through in a really big way to improve commodity prices, et cetera around the world, and just wondering to get your sense as to what the nature of the buying is right now?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, I think it's always like a fairly complex paradigm, and I'm not sure I'm going to do a justice. I would again in general say that in number of regions and number of countries, it's been a pretty rough three, four years. So, I would tend to characterize it more as a return to normalcy than necessarily any – any necessarily surge effect and pent-up demand or something like that. I don't think the characteristics of our businesses, demand kind of – I don't think there is a capacitance if that kind of builds up demand and then releases it. So, I think this is a return to normalcy. So, if you look at markets like Australia, which has definitely been affected by commodity prices over the last several years. They came off of a relative boom, a Chinese led boom, fell into pretty hard times, which directly affected us kind of disproportionally given the overweighting of the Australian market for us. I don't think that market is coming back in booming, I think it is coming back to kind of more normal conditions. Places like Russia is kind of recovering from what I recall kind of a geopolitical hiatus, where demand fell away pretty sharply and really tied to let's call a combative geopolitical environment. So I would say, again it's returning to normalcy. I would say is in places like Brazil, there may be a little bit more of special circumstances. Right now, given exchange rate parities and such is Brazil's – Brazil from an agricultural standpoint is in a pretty good position. They're very competitive given the exchange rate moves of recent times. And so, I would say that one maybe getting fed by a little bit more by special circumstances. So I think the conditions vary around the world, but rather than kind of look for. I see this has fundamentally returned to normalcy and presumably sustainable over in a relatively long period of time.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's really helpful. And then I am wondering if you can give any update on efforts to transition notably some of the offerings are subscription based from current perpetual models, that's still a meaningful effort and in what areas and kind of just an update on the progress there?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So, I would think about it in a couple of ways. One, let's take Greenfield development activities, that is that we are doing a rewrite or refresh of an existing software technology or we're creating something just entirely new. The vast majority of time that's going to default to a cloud offering, and therefore a SaaS – or almost by a definition therefore a SaaS business model offering of that technology. When we look at the existing software that we have in the company, still the majority of it today is perpetual license based software and recurring maintenance streams that go along with it. We do not have an express strategy to convert to SaaS for the sake of converting to SaaS. In many cases, in fact, we think that that would actually be a mistake and doesn't meet the needs of the customer, whether that would be through connectivity in remote field locations or by the processing power involved in some of the in-depth detailed engineering design applications that we have. So we don't do it for the sake of doing it. And then having said that, and the way we think about those conversions and undertaking those conversions within existing business is in the context of a long range plan or a long range strategy. And so, if you put it in context of, let's call it market penetration to go back to one of the earlier questions and if we see that that's a way to reach a new customer base, maybe we've been serving an enterprise set of customers and get to the small, medium size customer segment, they can't take on heavy implementation of the software, it's got to be lighter and easier to implement and then usually quid pro quo (44:31) is less feature rich. So as we see opportunities to go after new market segments and places, so to give you a couple of examples, such as our architecture and design business or in our trucking business, TMW, there is transportation management systems, those are two businesses that are undertaking SaaS development conversion efforts, simultaneous with continuing the perpetual offerings that we have today. So, hopefully that helps, James?
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, that's really helpful. And then, just last question. Can you give an update on, it seem like there had been some Geospatial related inventory that needed to be work through, any update on where you feel like the channel is on that now?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. Good question. So relative to the Geospatial inventory, what we believe we're seeing happen as survey – I'm talking – this is quite American-centric when I answer this. We're seeing more American U.S. survey crews going back to work, whether they're going back to work for DoT work or cadastral work related to construction, whether that be residential or non-res construction or in pockets of the country like the Permian Basin, where there are some well heads that are getting tapped – new well heads being tapped. We're seeing more surveyors go back to work. As more of the surveyors are going back to work, they're starting to work through. And I say starting to work through, the inventory that's been let's say so to speak on the shelf and as they work to that inventory and at the same time as we've come out with new innovations such as the SX10 that Steve talked about, that makes for a better context than we've seen here for a number of quarters.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's really helpful. Thank you so much.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I just wanted to start out just with your commentary around the infrastructure spending environment and perhaps maybe some color on what you're seeing there, in terms of willingness to spend either with or without sort of a federal spending package?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think the mood has probably changed over the last three – call three months, post election, it was relative euphoria, and a high anticipation that things would happen relatively quickly, relative to infrastructure spending. I think the relative mood or the assessment at this point is that, the whole infrastructure thing given healthcare, given tax reform is likely to be a 2018 event. So, I think that the environment is a bit more muted today than it would have been three months ago and a little bit more careful. So, I think right now in terms of the market today, I think it's become much more of a wait and see sort of market. Now, the thing that is taking place and I had it in the script as relatively casual reference is, there is a propensity for the States to not wait for the feds. And so, for example, you saw a relatively large package passed in California to invest in infrastructure, that is not happening, necessarily generally, but it is happening in a number of States. So, I think that the commitment to infrastructure is growing. It has not taken, let's call it generalized concrete form yet. So, I think from our perspective, the market is doing well without any real impact from the either anticipated or current federal spending. So, I think for us, it is likely to be a 2018 event. And if there were relatively quick movement on the infrastructure bill or the probability became better understood, I would say that we would see a level of investment in our sort of technology kind of at the front end of the curve, and not necessarily waiting for the actual money flow, but I think the probability is of quick results have decreased in the last three months, so I think right now people are more in a wait-and-see mode.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just relative to your comments around forestry, can you give us a sense of how big a business you think this can be for you, maybe timing for that? And how we should think about distribution for this type of vertical?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Distribution as in channel?
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Correct, distribution channel.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, so, compared to construction, compared to agriculture, compared to transportation, forestry is more of a niche market. It is a – I suppose a reasonable nine figure, more than $100 million sort of market, that is really not particularly well penetrated, it is quite fragmented. So, I think there is both a penetration potential here in terms of bringing technology to places that have never seen technology. I think there's also a market share argument to say that okay, the solutions in place are fragmented, not complete and that there is an ability to take share points. And then, I think there is the ability – a number of adjacencies there. So I think that, yeah, it's not the market, as we would define, it is not in the billions, it's in the hundreds of millions, but I think there is a significant potential for us making significant progress over the next few years. As forest channel, it tends to be a much more of an account based sort of business is, I would say inherently a direct sales effort kind of dominated by a few very large accounts around the world, and then there are a lot of much smaller growers. But, I think in general it would tend to revert to being a relatively direct sort of sales approach. At times, maybe augmented by third-party channels for smaller growers, but generally it's an account-based sales program.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham Company. Your line is open.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, just wanted to confirm what you were looking for, for this year in terms of overall growth. Steve was it middle-single digit organic growth with another couple of points inorganic, just wanted to make sure I was right on what you were thinking there?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Sorry, you were a little faint there. Can you restate please?
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Sorry, yeah just wanted to confirm what you were saying about your expected growth for the overall business this year. Was it mid-single digit organic growth with another couple of points from inorganic activities?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, I think, it is broadly characterized. Again, I don't want to be too specific about kind of the full year, we'll take it quarter-by-quarter. But just putting the stake in the ground relative to the first quarter, so reported 5.3%, there were exchange rate effects, there were divestitures, so we would regard the organic baseline to have been greater than 6.5% kind of apples-to-apples growth from the first quarter. You've got what we said in the – for the second quarter. And I would say is the sense at this point in time with what we can see is subject to geopolitical and all the other considerations is that we would actually expect a step-up on organic growth in the second half of the year. And then, we will see from a run-rate perspective, the acquisition activity will have a larger impact in the second half. So I would say, characterizing it as mid single-digits plus some number of points from acquisition. So, yeah, we're definitely looking to see a stronger second half of the year both in terms of the reported number, but then also the organic kind of baseline numbers in the second half compared to the first half.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: That's great. And then with respect to Manhattan Software, which had been a drag for quite a while basically since you'd acquired it. It sounds like it actually performed pretty well this quarter. Can you give us a sense on where you see that business being relative to it, what you consider a normalized level for a kind of revenue and margins?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, if we sort of break it into – let's say, some point and pieces, we get bookings before we get recognized revenue. So from a – it is called a business health perspective, we pay a lot of attention to what's coming in at call it the frontend at the top of the funnel. And in that respect, we feel decent about where the business is today. In other words, the bookings are steady and actually growing and we got one deal in particular that we recently won, that's one of the largest deals in the industry that's been out there. So in that respect, feel good about the competitive position that we have in the business and the management team has made a heck of a lot of I'd say operational improvements here of the last, well, really one year to two years. So I think from an operational efficiency standpoint, the team is heading in the right – they're heading in the right direction. Now, as all this translates to the bottom line while we are comping positive, we're still not where we want to be with the business. So we're not I'd say anywhere close to the company average of operating income, if I use that as the minimum expectations set that we would have to get to in the business we are not there today. What I will say, just a little more comment on the revenue side of Manhattan Software is that, I think by majority of the – excuse me, majority of the revenue is a SaaS revenue stream, is a recurring revenue stream. And so you have to be careful to also manage the business sensibly to manage it for the long-term health, and the cash flow of the business, not just for the optics of an immediate quarter's P&L, which in principal or in theory could drive either go after a license sale to drive accounting metrics, when really the right thing to do for the business is to drive the SaaS revenue and that's what we're doing is trying to do the right thing for the business to keep it going sustainably.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just one more if I could. Steve, in your prepared remarks, you made some mention to Geospatial. I thought you said so, it's first year-over-year growth since 2014, but I wasn't sure if you are referring to North American Geospatial or Geospatial. And then sort of a corollary, I mean do you think that business has now sort of at least stabilized where given the potentially – you should have pretty easy comps that that's potentially flat or up as we move forward the Geospatial business? Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So the comment was worldwide.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: The conditionality was that kind of on a baseline basis excluding divestiture and acquisition effects kind of apples-to-apples, it was up for the first time as a total business, as a total segment since 2014. And in terms of expectations, yeah, our – I think you characterized it appropriately which is at least for the foreseeable future, for the remainder of the year kind of characterizing it as kind of flattish to maybe up a little bit would be the safe assumption, and that's kind of baked into our sort of expectations overall.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. First, in the Building and Industrial segment, was the slower first quarter growth in heavy civil due to the tough comps that you saw from last year or is there something else happening there? And kind of more importantly, we've seen some positive construction activities, especially from some of your partners, so wondering what's your growth expectations are there for the year, and I know you don't guide to that, but are we going to start to see more accelerated growth driven by the States spending, given the views you already articulated about such spending likely being a 2018 impact?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Relative to the civil business, so that really represents the infrastructure part of buildings and infrastructure. I would say, what held back the civil growth in the quarter, geographically speaking, would have been the North American market. So we saw outsized growth in the non-North American market. So as we intersect that with the new products that launched at CONEXPO, intersect that with Steve's commentary on infrastructure spend and on engagement at for us whether it's at the federal level or at the state level, where it provides a backdrop we think to see some – well, I don't think, I've returned to normalcy or just see a return to better comps for that aspect of the business in North America, specifically. But we haven't banked the plan on some kind of hockey stick coming back in North America, and the words wait and see is kind of how we're approaching this business in North America, feel good about the growth outside of the U.S. that we would anticipate the rest of the year.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: I think I'm going to – there is another question to answer?
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: No. No. That was perfect, Rob. Thanks. And then, just on the ag side or the resource side. Any progress on the food processor customer base offerings and that's something that you guys kind of started talking about the end of last year, but any update on kind of how that's been going, you really talked about that in terms of the driver for the ag business here, recently? And then, as you've thought about it more, kind of what could that opportunity look like?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So the software growth in ag was a strong double-digit growth year-over-year and our former management solutions for processor as a customer, specific customer segment for that grew as well. So do feel good about where that, I'd call, where the business is and what the opportunity is for that business. I'll qualify it here for a bit, but it's a small portion of the overall agriculture business today, so a double-digit growth in, if I'd say the processor market isn't turning the tanker yet today, so just wanted to put that in its context. Now, if we look forward and look on what's the opportunity, we could see, well, we're really highly North American centric with those solutions today. So there is clear penetration – we believe there is clear penetration to be had in the U.S. and Canada market. And then as you look on a global scale that certainly would be in our ambition set, but really, really early days for us in that regard. So on a longer term perspective, we'd believe that there is an attractive business to be had here.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Excellent. That's helpful. Thanks again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Fisher from Dougherty. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Jon Fisher - Dougherty & Company LLC: (1:02:37) hanging on late here. Just some questions, on the OEM side on the construction equipment, those are some pretty profile brand-name companies that you listed in the slide deck. Are those competitive displacements, I find it hard to believe some of those firms didn't already have some sort of relationship or a system in place for their customers. So, I'm curious to know if those are organic wins there or if you're displacing a legacy competitor?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: I would say in general, there is always, yeah, there is always backdrop with competition. But rather than kind of put it in classical OEM terms about displacing somebody in an OEM context, I would say it's more about market penetration in terms of – I think for example at CONEXPO just walking the show, the words digital, the words technology were everywhere. And I think there is a recognition by the industry that the competitive challenge for the machine manufacturer is actually going to be the intelligent application of technology, kind of horsepower and torque and kind of the traditional virtues of the machine are really rapidly being pushed to side, and it's really more about how the technology is being applied. So, I would in – in a crude sense basically say, these were greenfield opportunities in terms of bringing the latest round of technology into the marketplace. So, I would characterize it more as a market penetration phenomenon and more so than as a competitive displacement.
Jon Fisher - Dougherty & Company LLC: Okay. And then on Manhattan Software, I know just from an accounting standpoint, one of the big issues has been some large legacy contracts that just you've – from a time standpoint you've just had to work through, given the sudden jump in growth, is it safe to assume that we're starting to anniversary some of those large legacy contracts, and if that is the case, kind of where would we be at in that cycle, how many more are there to go and how long would this kind of impressive growth could that be sustained if that is indeed what's going on?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: In terms of, let's say how many more there are to go, there is one primary one that I would reference in terms of a needle mover for the business, of course there is lots of implementations happening at any given time, but there is one in particular that of the nature I previously talked about is one we had to really work through and we can clear the debts on that, that frees up set of service folks to be able to go work on probably a long tail of customer implementations, so that's good news, but that is being worked down and the rest of your question was?
Jon Fisher - Dougherty & Company LLC: I guess I was under the impression that there were four, five, maybe six legacy contracts of measurable size just from a time and accounting standpoint we just had to kind of what the accounting standards and time work through? And I thought maybe if there were five or six, we've gotten through one or two of them, vis-à-vis this quarter, and that's why it was double-digit growth, and maybe there were three or four to go, but it sounds like there was really only one legacy contract of significance that is really the drag there at Manhattan, so?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. Okay, one last and I think we got through at least one them in Q1. As we look forward to the rest of the year that's one primary one for us to get through and as we get through that, and the nature of being able to free up the resources means, we can get the projects implemented the customers live and their revenue recognize, that will potentially accelerate their recognition of the revenue.
Jon Fisher - Dougherty & Company LLC: Great. And then one last question, just on the accounts receivable comment that you made on the balance sheet. Is the jump in accounts receivable, is that software deferred, SaaS related, revenue related or is that standard accounts receivable, we won some business and we're just waiting 30 days, 45 days to be paid for that kind of stuff?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, it's really all of the above, is the easy answer, just to know the nature software business, especially when you – for the maintenance. There is perpetual software that has an annual maintenance associated with it in the first quarter as the large billing quarter for that revenue stream. So that will naturally impact the AR, and then frankly, the timing of when those bills go out in the quarter, and impact to DSOs and AR balance itself, more towards the end of the quarter, you're going to see a DSO go up on these maintenance ones versus the bids on January 1, that's how it plays out.
Jon Fisher - Dougherty & Company LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Michael Leyba.
Michael Leyba - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you, Alex, and thank you everyone for attending today's call, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.

Operator: Good evening. My name is Kwiesha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. Mr. Jim Todd, you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Kwiesha. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to the presentation today. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables from our press release. With that, please turn to slide 3 for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter, the year and our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to slide 4 and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Good afternoon. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated continued progression. The fourth quarter combined with the third quarter represents the best dynamics of any six-month period since the first half of 2014. During the second half of 2016, all of our reported segments generated both year-over-year organic revenue growth and margin expansion. While we are not at our targeted model, largely because of the lingering agricultural downturn and the follow-on effects from the oil and gas dislocations, this performance does represent meaningful stabilization and improvement. The key elements present in the second half performance included the return of organic growth, evidence of tighter cost control and tightened organizational focus. We're particularly pleased with operating leverage of 62% in the fourth quarter and 46% for the entire second half. The international market generally has an upside bias. Markets outside the U.S. grew in aggregate at a rate substantially faster than the U.S., both for the quarter and full year. The exceptions to this otherwise positive view are primarily represented by the UK, Mexico, the Emirates and South Africa. The U.S. is lagging behind the growth rate seen elsewhere largely because of the ongoing difficulties in geospatial within E&C and the continued state of North American agriculture. The recent U.S. election created a number of potential contradictions. On the one hand, the prospects of tax reform, regulatory reform and significant U.S. infrastructure spend are potential upsides for Trimble. On the other hand, heightened ambiguity about the stability of international trade poses a significant source of uncertainty and potential challenge, given Trimble's international profile and our commitment to free movement of goods, services and people. At this point, the possibilities are highly speculative as no real insight into policy is available. During 2016, we put a heavy emphasis on restoring our robust financial model by controlling head count, tightly controlling our discretionary spend, pruning peripheral businesses that were not contributing, and fixing strategically relevant but underperforming businesses. The effects of our spending control were evident in the second half of the year with relative decline of expenses as a percentage of revenue and the resulting beneficial impact on operating margins. In addition, we improved focus by divesting our public safety business, our drone business, the hydro element of our agriculture business and most recently our ThingMagic business. Our efforts to fix strategically relevant elements of the portfolio that are not performing financially centered on the field service business in the Mobile Solutions segment and Manhattan Software and E&C. Our patience with these businesses remains contingent upon confirming their future growth potential, their strategic link to the rest of Trimble and their continued improvement trajectory. The field services business effectively broke even in the fourth quarter and is expected to be a contributor for all of 2017. The Manhattan Software, although still a financial drag, exceeded our expectations for the last two quarters. Moving into 2017, we will continue to emphasize the discipline needed to generate continued improvement. However, the recent improved performance provides scope to place increased emphasis on discrete organic growth initiatives with the aim of building momentum through 2017 and achieving even higher performance levels in 2018. These include the accelerating conversion of traditional software license models to SaaS models, the continued investment in Trimble Connect, development of our data and software capability in agriculture, the development of driver communities and third-party logistics providers in Mobile Solutions, and the development of autonomy concepts. After a period of relatively muted acquisition activity, while we focused on operations, we also expect 2017 to include more acquisition activity. The most recent example was announced this morning, which was the acquisition of Beena Vision in the rail space. A fourth quarter example was the acquisition of Building Data, which together with the 2013 acquisition of Trade Service, builds our BIM-centric content play in the mechanical, electrical and plumbing construction trades. Both Beena Vision and Building Data are profitable and directionally consistent with the Trimble financial model. After any short-term purchase accounting effects have dissipated, we anticipate them to be P&L accretive and to generate returns that exceed our weighted average cost of capital within a comparatively short period of time. Our current level of acquisition activity is running higher than it did through much of 2016, although the challenge will be to convert this activity into successful outcomes. We currently anticipate at least a few points of revenue growth coming from acquisition this year. We expect to stay close to home on acquisitions. We will be focused on extending the core franchises of construction, agriculture, and transportation, and building the emerging businesses of rail, water, forestry and electrical utilities. In addition to the other organic growth initiatives in 2017, we continue to place significant emphasis on reinforcing our ongoing go-to-market efforts. We have repeatedly discussed our intentions to build distribution capability, utilizing targeted third-party direct and key account channels. Recent examples in the marketplace reflect Trimble's growing brand and market influence. Our construction-centric users conference, Dimensions, was held in November and attracted over 4,400 attendees with over 625 educational sessions. in.sight, our transportation users conference, was held in September with over 2,400 attendees and 350 educational sessions. These examples emphasize Trimble's evolving relationship with its user community, from being a product provider to a provider of solutions that include bundles of hardware, software and services. Another go-to-market emphasis is the growing number of OEM relationships in construction and agriculture and transportation. Although the incremental volume provided by these relationships is interesting, the more significant consideration is the mixed fleet information ecosystem that is being created by incremental stats, hopefully with Trimble in the middle. Our current outlook for 2017 remains largely unchanged with the expectation of mid single-digit organic growth, boosted by a few points from acquisition. E&C is expected to grow organically at a higher rate than 2016 with a probability of a stronger second half. We expect growth from geospatial, civil engineering and building. Field Solutions has stabilized and is expected to demonstrate relatively modest revenue and profit growth. Mobile Solutions will reflect continued relatively strong revenue growth based on continuing growth in transportation and logistics and a growing contribution from field service. Our management focus is to demonstrate organic revenue growth throughout 2017 to consistently expand operating margins year-over-year and to build momentum during the year. There will be some sequential volatility from quarter to quarter, but we have reestablished a trajectory that is up and to the right. Rob?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Let's turn to slide 5. Our fourth quarter results came in ahead of expectations with top line and bottom line results meeting or exceeding our expectations in all our reporting segments. Fourth quarter total revenue was $586 million, up 5% year-over-year. The combination of currency translation and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures reduced revenue by approximately 1%. Fourth quarter gross margins were 56.9%, neutral both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income was up 19%, as the effect of our operating model improvements continue to bear fruit. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.31, up $0.04 or 15% year-over-year. Bottom line performance in the quarter was reflective of our cost reduction initiatives and was tempered by previously discussed expenses relating to our biannual Dimensions Conference of about $5 million. Adjusting for the Dimensions Conference expenses, we would have achieved a non-GAAP operating income margin of 19.2%, representing year-over-year improvement of 290 basis points on an apples-to-apples basis. Lastly, our deferred revenue increased 8% to $284 million, and operating cash flow increased 59% to $125 million. Turning to slide 6, full-year total revenue was $2.362 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced revenue approximately 1% and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added about 1%. Full-year gross margin was 56.4%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Full-year non-GAAP net income was over $302 million, up a little less than 4% from prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $1.19, up $0.06 or about 5%. Bottom line performance for the year was driven by cost reduction initiatives and the portfolio actions with margin progression realized throughout the year and was tempered on the whole by discrete R&D investments we have been making in relation to specific market opportunities that we believe are compelling over the long term. 2016 was a tale of two halves of earning performance, with the first half of 2016 EPS down 2% year-over-year and the second half performance up 14% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was $407 million, up 15% for the year, and during the year, we repurchased about $119 million of our common stock. Turing to our quarterly results by segment, let's start with our Engineering & Construction segment on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was $320 million, up slightly with currency translation reducing revenue about 1%, and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures adding about 1%. Within Engineering & Construction, revenue performance was mixed, with growth in our civil engineering and construction, and building construction businesses offset by a decline in our geospatial business. Our civil engineering and construction business finished the quarter up single digits. The U.S. market continues to be challenging, while outside the U.S., we continue to experience strong performance with double-digit increases in some markets. Our OEM relationships continue to drive business and solidify our place at the heart of the construction information ecosystem. With our building construction business, revenue was steady and up single digits, with growth in this business restrained by negative currency impacts, or on a relative basis, we have a higher percentage of our sales denominated in British pounds and euros. Our Manhattan Software business, which we have discussed in previous calls, demonstrated improvement in the quarter and is trending in the right direction. During the quarter, we acquired Building Data, which will further strengthen our building information modeling offering in the mechanical, electrical and plumbing space. Within geospatial, end markets remain challenging, as we've previously discussed. On a global basis, we see our market share holding or growing and we are starting to see customers work through underutilized inventory. Innovation is a key to regaining growth in geospatial and our SX10 launch has been a success both with dealer partners as well as end customers. Turning now to slide 8, Field Solutions had fourth quarter revenue of $83 million, up 5% with currency translation having a minor negative effect, while the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures was neutral. Operating margins were down 120 basis points year-over-year based on product mix dynamics in agriculture and GIS performance. Within Field Solutions, our agriculture business experienced low double-digit growth, largely driven by growth with OEM partners, software and growth in emerging markets, including Brazil, Argentina and Russia. The end market in North America has been down now for a few years with double-digit end market declines in 2014, 2015 and 2016. We believe an inflection point is near, as equipment continues to age and as our product and customer mix continues to evolve. We continue to see growth in our software business where we saw double-digit growth in subscription revenues. Furthermore, we see growth from our strategy to address stakeholders throughout the agricultural value chain such as agronomists, retailers and processors. The overall growth of our Field Solutions segment was partially offset by a revenue decline in our GIS business, where we experienced a drop in our federal business coupled with the continued trend of industrial data collection devices being disrupted by consumer devices. This trend has had an impact on both unit volume as well as average selling prices. In response, we recently launched our Catalyst solution, which brings high accuracy positioning to consumer devices and we made some organizational changes that we believe will bring marketing, sales and strategy into better alignment. Moving to Mobile Solutions on slide 9, Mobile Solutions achieved revenue of $147 million, up 11% with currency translation reducing revenue about 1% and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures reducing revenue about 2%. Within Mobile Solutions, our transportation business experienced double-digit revenue growth, as our mobility and enterprise solutions continue to benefit from the electronic logging device mandate, driving opportunities to engage with customers and to show them the breadth of our product and service portfolio. We're also starting to see some of the fruits of our R&D expenditures, as new product introduction contributed to the growth of the business. For example, our video solutions drove incremental revenue in Q4 as well as all of 2016. We were also named the top telematics industry innovator by ABI Research in December, a nice acknowledgement of the accomplishments of our team. Lastly, I'd like to point out that while we are pleased with the growth in our transportation business during the fourth quarter, our year-over-year comparison was enhanced by lower than expected revenue in the fourth quarter of last year due to product delays, which we discussed in last year's fourth quarter call. In our field services management business, as Steve mentioned, we were able to achieve profitability with the help of revenue recognition on a deferred contract. This business is poised for ongoing profitability heading into the first half of 2017. If you turn now to slide 10, our Advanced Devices segment achieved revenues of $35 million, up 21% with currency translation having a neutral impact, and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures reducing revenue about 2%. In our first quarter call this year, we described a decline in this segment in the first quarter, coupled with an expected rebound late in the year, mostly related to timing issues. This came to fruition in the fourth quarter with top line growth that exceeded our expectations. With cost control applied to a more conservative internal revenue plan, we were able to expand operating margins. Higher than expected revenue growth came from new product introductions and continued growth in our positioning technologies related to autonomous driving. Lastly, as part of our ongoing strategy to tighten corporate focus, we divested our ThingMagic RFID business, which happened within the first quarter of 2017. Next slide 11, by geography, our revenue mix for the quarter was 53% from North America, 24% from Europe, 16% from Asia-Pacific and 7% from rest of world. North America was up 4% year-over-year, an improvement from last quarter. Within North America, revenue in the U.S. and Canada were up while revenue declined in Mexico. Europe was flat in the fourth quarter driven by decline in the UK. Excluding the UK, revenue in Europe was up double digits in the quarter and up single digits for the year. UK continues to be a challenging end market with revenue down double digits in both the quarter and for the year. Asia-Pacific revenue experienced growth in all segments in the fourth quarter. For the year, revenue has grown double digits in Japan, Australia and India; and single digits in China. Lastly, rest of world was relatively flat year-over-year. Moving now to revenue mix, slide 12 shows us that our software services and recurring streams represented 47% of our revenue for the year, flat with respect to prior year, while recurring revenue represented 28% of company revenue for the year, 1 percentage point higher than the prior period. I'd like to point out that hardware revenue in our Mobile Solutions segment, specifically in the PeopleNet business, grew at a double-digit rate during the year and an even higher double-digit rate during the fourth quarter. And in this business, hardware installation perceived subscriptions, so the revenue mix impacted this hardware growth dynamic, kept the software revenue mix from further expanding. At the company level, recurring revenues grew over 8% for the year, which is more than twice the rate of growth of our overall revenues for the year. And our SaaS offerings continue to be a growing portion of our current and projected future revenue base. Turning to slide 13, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the recent acquisitions and divestitures that we have executed on, recently. 2016 was a year, in which our acquisition activity was lower than previous years. And we executed on a number of divestitures as part of the continuing program to tighten our organization focus. During fiscal 2016, we divested five businesses, and we recently announced the divestiture of another in the first quarter of 2017. This morning, we announced the acquisition of Beena Vision Systems, a manufacturer of vision-based wayside detectors for the railroad industry. Slide 14 provides a one-page overview of the acquisition, inclusive of the company description, an overview of our existing rail portfolio and the strategic rationale for acquiring Beena Vision to expand our rail portfolio. Beena Vision will report up to our Engineering & Construction segment and we expect the business to be accretive to earnings after approximately one quarter of negative purchase accounting effects. Moving on to slide 15, I would also like to take a moment to talk about an upcoming accounting change that impacts revenue from contracts with customers. The pronouncement is ASC606 and it represents the biggest change in accounting in many years. The intensive ASC606 is to conform to international standards and enable more comparable global and cross industry comparison. We anticipate there to be some puts and takes on our various revenue streams under this new revenue recognition standard. And while we are not ready to quantify those at this point, we do want to signal to investors that we will be spending a significant amount of effort and money for this compliance exercise. We expect capital expenditures to exceed $10 million for this project and a couple of pennies of EPS expense per year for the next several years. Turning now to slide 16, we finished the quarter with $327 million of cash and short-term investments, and during the year, we reduced indebtedness by about $110 million. During the year, we also repurchased about $119 million worth of stock. Our net debt position provides us with dry powder for acquisitions that we hope to execute on over the coming year. Further, as our business continues to transition to increase software and services streams, our deferred revenue experienced growth of 8%. Cash flow from operations in 2016 was up 15%, assisted by revenue mix shifts and effective management of working capital. Our inventory turns and days sales outstanding metrics showed the results of specific improvement initiatives with days sales outstanding dropping four days year-over-year and inventory turns meaningfully improving as well. In 2016, cash flow from operations strengthened to greater than 1.3 times non-GAAP net income due to these improvements. In 2017, we expect that ratio to come down, but expect that operating cash flow will continue to comfortably exceed non-GAAP net income. Finally, as it relates to post-election policy considerations, we are monitoring and assessing potential impacts relating to corporate tax reform, cash repatriation, interest rate and CapEx deductibility, regulatory reform, infrastructure initiatives, as well as trade and immigration. These considerations could present positives and negatives for us, but it is too early to speak with any specificity until policy details begin to emerge. With that, we now turn to Q1 guidance in slide 17. We expect Q1 revenue to be between $585 million and $615 million, and non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.27 and $0.32. A bit of commentary on our revenue guidance. The U.S. dollar has strengthened on a year-over-year basis, which provides a top line growth headwind of approximately 1%. We will also see about 0.5% negative impact in Q1 from the net of M&A and divestures. As per the bottom line progression, we continue to expect meaningful year-over-year progression. Please do note that when you look at our operating expenses from a sequential perspective, we normally see a sequential step up from Q4 to Q1, and we expect that this quarter as well. In closing, please note that this quarter we will be at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco on February 27 and 28 and the Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference on March 7. Let's now take your questions.
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. I just wanted to start out with your commentary around potentially seeing an inflection point around the Field Solutions business. How should we be thinking about that? I know it's relatively early days both in terms of how meaningful it could be and potential timing of that inflection point?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan, this is Rob. So if you look at Field Solutions over the last, let's say, few quarters, Q3 and Q4 of 2016 represented positive year-over-year comps, Q2 was a flat, and then the preceding quarters before that had been negative for some time. So at this point, we're looking – if I really look back to Q2 and I guess I could argue one level of the inflection point there when we hit the one from the negative to the zero and then turn positive in Q3 and Q4. And now as we look forward into 2017 on, let's say, the annual basis, we have conviction that we'll see some growth again in Field Solutions. And then maybe the last thing to add is in North America specifically that if we were to turn – let's say, hit a meaningful inflection point in the U.S. market, that could materially move our numbers.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Got it. And then, just relative to your 2017 guidance, I just wanted to better understand what the macro assumptions were that you are contemplating and maybe what some of the levers on the macro side could be either to get to the higher end or maybe any headwinds relative to your guidance?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: I think the overall judgment relative to 2017 on the macros is effectively no change from the recent circumstances. I think at this point in time, we generally see an improving trend internationally with a few exceptions that we called out. So I think the big swing relative to 2017 would be the U.S., so kind of the current assumption is no change. And kind of given the current environment that is probably not, a, going to end up being the right assumption is just directionally which way to call it is the question. So I think that, first of all, the downside swinger would be on the trade side, if barriers start going up in kind of tit for tat mode, that would not be a positive for us. That would be a significant negative. So I think that's the most significant downside scenario. Now, there is more talk about increased growth rates in the U.S., there is the infrastructure spending possibility, there is corporate tax reform and all that. So I would say is the big swingers for us, I think, ultimately kind of distilling it down on the positive side would be okay, let's call a pickup in growth rate in the U.S. kind of releasing animal spirits, if you will, that have probably been dormant for some time and the other would be, I think, the discreet step of actually doing something on the infrastructure spend side. The devils and the details on the infrastructure spend side in terms of what it actually goes to, it could be a big number, but if it goes – but from our perspective, it would be actually what is the money being spent for would be the key determinant. So I would say those are the leverage points. I would say that in some of our markets, the relative buoyancy of attitude actually has improved in the U.S. since the election. For example, the trucking industry seems to be kind of something to have an emotional upswing at this point in time. Whether that actually gets translated into increased spending levels or not, we'll see. But I think it's too early to tell for sure, but I think there are some distinct leverage points for us as a company.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Okay. And your next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.
Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's Yuuji Anderson on for James. Thanks for taking my question. As we think about the pace of margin improvements throughout 2017, could you give us a little bit more color perhaps on the segment level? Where do you think we will see the biggest improvements there?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: If I think about for the total, I'll put in the context as a total year, really the two areas I would point to would be Mobile Solutions and Engineering & Construction would have the, I'd say, most meaningful impact. Now Mobile Solutions, to understand that dynamic greater, mostly it's a software-oriented reporting segment with a growing cumulative subscriber base, so the math works there in terms of the margin expansion. And then within Engineering & Construction, getting a, let's call it, a full-year effect of some of the cost cutting activities that took place within the second half of 2016, we would expect to flow through and have operating margin expansion.
Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And to follow up on Mobile Solutions, if I recall, last year there was a slight step down in Q1 margins because of upfront hardware revenues. Is that something that's going to play out now or has that mostly passed given Q4 results?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So you mean sequentially Q4 to Q1?
Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Correct.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, actually I would expect to see a step down in the sequential margins in that segment. Sort of one factor that's a little bit unique to this segment for us is the nature of how we have different PTO policies actually in a couple of our businesses in this segment. So, basically as you come into Q1, then we would be stepping back up into the vacation policies that also hit your FICA adjustments – or I should say FICA coming back on for employees. So the sum of that actually drives an OpEx delta quarter-to-quarter, and that's sort of the, one of the last things I said in my guidance for the quarter is about the sequential step up in OpEx from Q4 to Q1, so that plays through a little bit.
Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon and good evening. Steve, I'm wondering if you could talk about your increased focus on M&A. Is that driven by the opportunity set that you see in the marketplace or are you focused on a handful of the platforms that you described of building a solution with bigger scale? Can you just step us through the pivot in the strategy? And then, can you maintain the level of OpEx performance that you folks have had in the back half of 2016, as you ramp up the M&A efforts?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So I think that kind of the M&A environment, maybe is a convergence of a number of things. I think one element, although I would call nothing that's available cheap at this point in time, I think valuations have maybe moderated a bit from what they were maybe a year to two years ago when there was something of a feeding frenzy partly fed by private equity, partly fed by kind of strategic buying into kind of a digital view of the world. Again not cheap, but I think probably a little bit more – a little easier to have conformed to a business model looking forward. I think again our perspective is to stay quite focused on a value-oriented strategy here, which is really to look for franchise value creation when it comes to our more established business of construction, of agriculture, of transportation in terms of looking at kind of network effects with our existing set of assets and a, really focus on that as well as keeping a pretty disciplined view in terms of time horizon to profitability really in most cases saying that once we were through the purchase accounting is that we would expect to see P&L accretion and with a reasonable time framework to kind of return on capital sorts of perspectives. When it comes to some of these emerging businesses of ours, forestry, electrical, water and rail, there I think what we're attempting to do more discretely is to do what we did in buildings and what we did in transportation and logistics is really to build out a franchise built around the lifecycle, the workflow, the lifecycle of the industry. In most cases, we believe that from a conceptual standpoint, we have a pretty evolved view, a pretty evolved intellectual model of what to do in these industries and we believe that we have perhaps a unique ability to – or a relatively unique ability to kind of build out a franchise. So I would say is, reinforcing for the existing businesses and let's call franchise building and creating some network effects in these emerging businesses. But keeping very focused on outcomes, very focused on performance I would say is that, having said that, I would say in terms of the OpEx performance that we achieved in the second half of the year, part of the discipline on the M&A is basically to make sure that we don't compromise the progress we've created here in terms of financial model progression. I think, yeah, it's inevitable particularly when in the software realm to probably stress the model a little bit when making an acquisition, but our objective would be to be pretty transparent on that and along with a time horizon in terms of when an acquisition is going to conform. I think on the two most recent ones that we talked about here today, I think they're going to conform to the model very quickly and we would expect the others that may follow along to kind of follow in that mode.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And can you say more about the opportunity that you expect to emerge as you get the mixed fleet data in construction equipment OEMs, your vision on ag is pretty clear, I'm wondering what's the ultimate opportunity that you're targeting as you get more data under the belt in construction equipment?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, it is less about us than really about the user, the contractors is to make that data available to the contractor. Ultimately the contractor has the view that the data is theirs. And what the contractor does not need is a set of desperate data realms coming from different colors of the equipment that somehow have to be reconciled. And so I think that is less about us accumulating the data and in some sense trying to monetize it, although there may be opportunities to do that then to become, let's call it, the trusted advisor to the contractor and pulling together kind of the data collection as well as the analytics that drives decisions to allow them to optimize their operations. So per se, we're not looking to be the data hub. It may turn not to be that way, but more really to facilitate the contractor to usefully use kind of the access to the data and the analytics.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: The question, first one is for Rob, actually. Deferred revenue is growing faster than revenues at the moment and – not by much – but by enough perhaps to have some bearing on margins. Is the deferred revenue generally of a higher margin sort of when it adds back to the firm later on to the income statement later on, it will actually be accretive in some way?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Short answer is yes.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Is it material, do you think?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: I would call it, I'd say, meaningful maybe more so than material, but it is coming in an attractive margin management – you get it from the software maintenance and the subscription revenue. So the maintenance would be materially higher margin as our revenue stream and then subscription is closer to fitting, let's say, the normal profile.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. And then Steve, you made some comments about upgrading your go-to-market strategy. I didn't quite catch the context. Perhaps you can elaborate. Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So, Paul, not calling out anything particularly new in that, just a continuing point of emphasis for us, as you know we've been talking about needing to focus and upgrade our key accounts capability and we reorganized in the fourth quarter to bring more focus on that, but key account selling is going to be an increasing part of what we need to do to access, while we already have a strong key account capability in transportation and logistics, but it's going to become increasingly more important in the agriculture and construction. We're taking efforts to beat that up. On the third-party distribution, we've been tracking for years about SITECH, more recently about BuildingPoint and Vantage, BuildingPoint on the building construction side and Vantage on the agriculture side, and so those initiatives continue. And I think that in general, in many cases across the company, we are not product constrained. We are in, let's call, an adequate to very good range from a product standpoint, and therefore in those cases, I think go-to-market becomes the key point of discussion and we're simply being as opportunistic as we can to bring the right go-to-market solutions to bear in those cases where we have, call it, better than product sufficiency. So again, nothing new, same things just being reinforced.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. Rob, could you perhaps elaborate a little bit on the BIM business? I mean, you commented, in the fourth quarter, it was plus single digits. Obviously UK quite soft. How did the business do in the other geographies, U.S., Europe, Asia – Europe ex-UK?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, okay, so the UK was down in that business. Asia is not a very large percentage of our sales in the BIM-centric businesses. So really Europe and North America are main drivers, so if I look at the U.S., yeah, we were up higher relative to the overall profile that I described, same with Europe was up, and then UK was down, and then as that Europe revenue translated back into USD, we took a slice off the top of the that business. Our building construction business, as you know, is mostly software-oriented business, and that business has, I'd say, a fair mix of revenue in euro and British pound relative to some of our other businesses, so that took some off the top as it came back.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And as you know in the UK given Brexit, I mean that's a structural shift there. I am not sure what you've done on the cost side there, but does the BIM business, i.e., Manhattan primarily sitting in the UK, does that need to structurally be much smaller from a cost perspective just given the structural change in the UK construction market? I mean, has that been the approach there?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, that's been some of the approach, and there is also another side to the equation, which is – it actually is in the buildings businesses one of the countries that has the highest percent of employees in the buildings business. So while I complain about the – or mention the top line haircut coming back from currency translation, I should be fair and say that there is some labor arbitrage there, as the UK OpEx comes back into USD, and a fair amount of our team in the UK is R&D-oriented, developing global products. So in that regard, a country-specific dynamic, right, doesn't per se affect our viewpoint on having resources there. In fact, you could argue that it got cheaper and became a better place to have some of those resources. And then I would then dial that back and then look specifically more at the sales and marketing resources specifically for the UK, and there I think it would be a fair comment for you to say that we sharpen the pencil on where we think the market's going to – will settle out at after things calm down.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: When you look at E&C for 2017 and you look at the adjusted non-GAAP op profit there, it strikes to me that surveying we know as being somewhat higher margin business as well, so that'll help from a mix standpoint and then given the cost out in BIM, should we expect a 100 basis plus improvement in the adjusted non-GAAP op margin for all of E&C for next year? Is that a pretty reasonable target?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's pretty reasonable and a fair amount of that comes through playing the cost reduction initiatives that took place in the second half of 2016 into the dynamic of those playing forward to really, you could kind of think about Q3 and Q4 in 2016 compared to Q1 and Q2 within the reporting segment, and as you play that forward, one should see some op margin progression in the order of magnitude certainly that you just described.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just a quick question for Steve. In the comments about growth initiatives, you listed a number of – I mean, you mentioned economy concepts. Is that the autonomous vehicles business and maybe you could just – if it is, could you just kind of speak to that a little bit and I presume that's down in the Advanced Devices piece?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Actually, Richard, the comment applies for pretty much the entire company to some level or another. Last quarter we talked a bit more about autonomy and what it really means for Trimble. So I think first of all, it is not necessarily synonymous with passenger vehicles first of all. There may be place for us there, but it's ranging from everything from componentry to providing positioning services, because on passenger vehicles, there has been really, in the last year, kind of increased sensitivity to being able to have both absolute position to centimeter-level precision as well as relative position, and obviously absolute position is our game. But then I think that we don't have, let's call it, a particularly well-defined strategy at this point in time, but if you kind of go through all of our businesses, whether it be construction or agriculture or transportation, autonomy is going to be a piece of the 5-year or 10-year solution. And so I think that we have roles to play. We're simply attempting to participate in a number of nascent opportunities across those businesses and really try to come to a view in terms of what might be commercially viable for us. And it's not obvious that we will be a big player there. We don't have a great interest to be supplying components. We would like to be very much in the end user business, so I think it's really going to – it's going to consume some cost, so that's why we're bringing it up, but the revenue side is not yet very well evolved.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I understand. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the attach rates for the software with your ELD deployment so far and any changes you're seeing over the last quarter or two?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Well, the business, I would just characterize it as having had record backlog of orders, and when we were looking in the first half of 2016, we mentioned that we've gotten our largest order ever in Mobile Solutions. Quite around this time last year, we started talking about that order. And really I think we continue to see that play through, the nice backlog continues in the business. And I would say anything is fundamentally shifted one way or the other relative to the ELD mandated seems to be playing out largely to our expectations at this point.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just shifting gears to the supply chain, in terms of potential risk or exposure on imports, can you talk a little bit about how much of the supply chain is potentially subject to new or increasing tariffs that you guys might have to deal with on the hardware side?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So if you split our business and let's talk about sort of simple high-level hardware and software, and I guess you asked about the software, Colin – the hardware, Colin, but hardware and software, if you look at our software business, we would have a higher nexus of R&D resources in the U.S. and that fits a little bit more of a profile of a net exporter in the software-centric businesses. In our hardware businesses, we definitely are manufacturing in the U.S., but we also manufacture on a global basis. And we then start to talk about the supply chain. It's a global supply chain with a global manufacturing footprint. A good amount of that manufacturing footprint we have has come through outside the U.S., has come through acquisitions. In fact maybe really all of it's come through, almost all of it's come through acquisitions where we then bring that product into the U.S., so it's high on that list of things that we're monitoring to see how the policy might actually play out and what's considered the value add in the whole supply chain.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, at the same time, it's probably not a totally linear sort of calculation. If the U.S. imposes tariffs or trade barriers, it's highly likely that there will be again a response around the world. So it could be – and Trimble is far from an unique in the score. There could be a much more complicated universe evolving in terms of tariff regimens, trade restrictions and such around the world. So I think it's potentially quite a complex dynamic here.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera from Needham & Company.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company Inc.: Thank you. Steve, just wanted to follow up on your commentary on sort of the full-year expectations for the overall business. I think what you'd said was you were looking at roughly mid single-digit organic growth and potentially I think two to three points from acquisitions, which would conceivably put you kind of in the mid to upper single-digit growth rate for the year. And your first quarter guide calls for sort of 3 percentage at the midpoint, which would seem to imply some acceleration of the year-over-year comps as we move through the year. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that. I think you mentioned – you did mention, I think, E&C might see some acceleration in the back half, but I don't think there were any other businesses that were specifically called out as potentially seeing acceleration in the back half. So just want to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. I think that from a business perspective, E&C is the business, or the set of businesses that maybe most clearly have kind of a first half, second half bifurcation. So I think that E&C, which again represents, call, half the company, we would expect a better second half than a first half there for any number of reasons that relate to new products and kind of programs that we can see. The other thing that in terms of – so I think that potentially brings us back into this mid single-digit category. There are some dynamics also in agriculture, in field services, for example, that also tend to point to the second half being stronger than the first half. And then the acquisition effects will be hardly noticeable in the first quarter. We would expect them to start to layer in more significantly in the second quarter and particularly the second half. So yeah, we are expecting kind of the first half particularly exchange and divesture adjusted to be relatively consistent with the second half of 2016, and we do anticipate a step up from that as we get deeper into the year.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And just wanted to follow up also on the ELD mandate. I think Rob when you answered a previous question, you said it was kind of performing as expected, I guess, but wanted to get a little more color on that. I mean I believe that the mandate says you kind of have to be, have something by the end of this year, I think. So that should suggest this year could be a pretty strong year as the trucking companies look to put that in. So just wanted to get any other color you could on the ELD mandate, sort of how much is maybe, if you look at the whole implementation of the upgrade, how much do you think has sort of been done versus how much maybe is still to come if there is any way to assess that? Thank you.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure, no problem. So I'd break it down in a couple of respects. So we talk about ELD, but there is actually – and that would go into effect in about a year – but if a customer actually already has what's called an AOBRD, an automatic on-board recording device, if you already have one of those devices, that device is actually may not be ELD compliant. In other words, you could have some older technology that's not ELD compliant. If you already have this older technology that's classified as this AOBRD device, you actually have a couple additional years before you have to go to the mandate. So as opposed to a one-year, let's say, I don't call it, cliff of demand in the next 12 months, actually it's a multi-year topic to go to full ELD conversion. So, that's probably the first thing that actually extends the tale from a timing perspective. And then as we look at the overall market and let's call it the addressable market, there'd be one half of the market, which has an AOBRD device on it today, and some element of those will need to be upgraded over this next, call it, three-year time period and then call it the paper-based part of the market that doesn't have technology that we're going after today, that segment's into the larger fleets, the medium size fleets and then the small fleets and then we're most relevant today in the medium and the large fleets. So, that's how I think about breaking that market down and having runway beyond this year on this ELD topic.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company Inc.: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here at the end. Rob, I just wanted to clarify on a previous response in that you've not yet seen demand for your ag offerings in North America pick up, but if that did happen, then it would provide meaningful growth in 2017. Is that right?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, that's right, Brett. So, what I would say, we're seeing in North America is less of a decline by the straight math and then the other dynamic that plays in North America for the overall ag business is our software and services business is quite U.S.-centric. So if I add that on top of the hardware, which the hardware business in U.S. which was what I would characterize as having less of a decline rate in North America, that's what creates that inflection that I am talking about.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And have you started to see in the field, if you will, any interest or kind of pick-up in possible demand?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. I would say as much anecdotally in terms of sentiment. I saw your report after the show and what some of the farmers are saying about precision, ag and technology, and say we see some of that sentiment as well and in terms of then turning it into dollars and cents, we're really starting to enter that buying season now. So I think we'll know soon enough on that.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then finally speaking on the same topic, you also continued to see the strong demand in emerging markets. Have you seen any traction so far with customers outside of farmers or agronomists? In the prepared remarks, you mentioned retailers and processors. Just wondering if that's kind of transcribed yet too.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, good question. So let's say on the hardware, the traditional hardware business and ag continues to do well outside the U.S. That profile hasn't changed and it continues to go pretty well. And in Brazil – I mean I could point to other markets, but I'll take Brazil as the example, and right, a farmer's selling soy in Brazil on a smart spot market in USD, he is making money right now, right, with the depressed real. And then as it relates to the software business, the solutions we're selling to agronomists and the processors, especially the agronomist is really North American-centric still, so U.S. and Canada. And then solutions to retailers and the processors has been – so, let's say outside of the U.S., I'd say Australia has been the market where we've seen some traction.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Excellent, that's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hi Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Just a clarification question. How big is Beena? I mean, what kind of revenue size is that?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: And so, think of it as around 1% of Trimble revenue, plus or minus.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you. And as you've started talking about the outlook for various segments and that sort of have specific piece in each one. In the E&C business, there's some of the growth. Is there any change in relationship with Caterpillar with the new management, is the ag business really being stepped up from Latin America that's probably where it's coming from? And with the forecast decline for truck sales likely this year, is it really the ELD that's driving the growth in the marketplace?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: So relative to CAT, Eli, I guess you'll find out when anybody else finds out if there are any changes, but now we're not anticipating any changes. We've known Jim Umpleby for probably 10-plus years, so we don't anticipate any surprises. The relationship obviously evolves over time, particularly given Caterpillar's relatively recent focus on kind of the digital world. But I don't think change...
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Should be a big change?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. But change of regime, I don't think, has – we've been through – we're now into our one, two, three, fourth – fourth CEO since we kind of formalized the relationship, so I think the relationship transcends changes in CEOs probably on both sides. What was your second question?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: The ag market pickup, is that mostly Latin America at this point, the upturn that we're seeing in Brazil?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: I think it's generalized. North America remains the thing to explain in agriculture, but certainly both Brazil and Argentina are showing – well, the South America in general, I think, is showing very strong performance for the reasons Rob spoke to.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Russia and Europe were also up as well, Eli. And so, yes, it's been really just outside of North America in general.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: And on the truck sales question you had on the last one, so we've seen mixed data on that on what the forecast is for the new units irrespective of the new units because, you're right, ELD is certainly a driver of demand. And then, as it relates to the very, let's call it, the new units coming off the line, last year was the first time we had an OEM business. So we wouldn't be, let's exposed, to a cycle on new units and truck sales. However, I've seen some mixed data. And I think the manufacturers are having some different data they're putting out in terms of potential new unit sales.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And just one final clarification on the Advanced Devices, it had a great quarter and great year. Is that sustainable? Is that growth – the margin sustainable? I mean, that's been a big help all the way through?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: It certainly has been a nice performing business. Let's take the top and bottom. At a top line, I would expect that business to be flattish and that really fits the profile of the revenue in the last few years. So the question, I think, then really becomes around sustaining the margin performance in Advanced Devices. And it would certainly be our aim to stay in that neighborhood of performance where we were in 2016.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you very much.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to the company.
Jim Todd - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for attending today's call. And we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Tasha, and I'm your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Michael Lesyna, Director of Investor Relations (sic) [Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development] (00:29), you may begin your conference.
Michael W. Lesyna - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Tasha. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. I would like to point out that our earnings release and a slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to that presentation today. Turning to slide two of that presentation, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. With that, please turn to slide three for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides, including an in-depth review of the quarter and our guidance, and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to slide four and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Good afternoon. Our third quarter results were mixed. While we showed progress against last year and continued the trend of revenue growth and margin expansion, revenue was below the expectations we held at the beginning of the quarter with the largest shortfall against expectation being in geospatial, which continues to struggle with adverse market conditions. The worldwide market remains uncertain and comparatively volatile, with some regions providing balance (02:18) and others displaying unclear signs. The two countries which are providing the most ambiguity are the U.S. and the UK. U.S. did not deliver the results we anticipated, particularly in geospatial. What is not clear is whether this is a result of the election-related investment reluctance, or whether this is the beginning of a more long-lasting trend. In addition, we had a second consecutive quarter of significant decrease in UK revenue. Some of this is exchange effect and some, we are assuming, is Brexit, with the same question on the duration of the effect. Europe, without the UK, grew in the quarter and has demonstrated relatively strong growth year-to-date. South America was up strong double-digits in the quarter across all segments, with sentiment improving in Brazil and Argentina, particularly in our agriculture. Asia-Pacific was also up sharply, with Japan, Australia, China and India, all contributing. Given the uncertainty of the environment and the resulting uncertainty around our revenue, our organizational focus is on restoring a robust financial model and building long-term growth and a strong competitive position in those markets that can produce meaningful growth. The key points of emphasis have been on controlling head count, which is down at the company level, even with acquisitions and tightly monitoring and controlling our discretionary spend. In addition, we continue to tighten our strategic focus through an ongoing portfolio tune-up, which consists of disposing of non-core businesses, products or product categories that are not contributing strategically or bottom line. We've recently divested Gatewing, our UAV airframe business. This does not diminish our commitment to the future of UAVs and remote sensing. At the time we entered the market, airborne platforms were relatively unique and a key to selling a system. Since then, the number of airframe platforms have proliferated and no longer provide unique value. Our judgment is that we will create more value and sustainable differentiation by focusing on software, data and sensor integration. We will now regard the airframe as a buy element and, as part of the divestiture; we have entered into an advanced supply relationship. We also divested our Hydro operation within the agriculture business, which provided engineering water management services to municipalities and was not central to our main strategic priorities in agriculture. The two significant currently non-performing businesses in the portfolio and which our emphasis is on a performance fix are the Field Services business, which is in the Mobile Solutions segment; and Manhattan Software, which is in the Engineering & Construction segment. The combined bottom line effect of these two businesses has been to reduce operating margin by over a point year-to-date. Our relative patience with these businesses and retention within the portfolio has been based on the belief that they provide the basis of future growth, that they're strategically linked to the rest of the Trimble businesses, and are relevant SaaS-centric software businesses, that they are currently on a performance improvement trajectory, and that the underlying performance of these businesses is not entirely captured by GAAP accounting, and net bookings, billings and cash flow represent additional metrics at least until we reach steady state. While we are emphasizing progression in short-term financial performance, we are balancing short-term considerations with the need to establish the basis for long-term growth and business model development. Part of the short-term challenge is the conversion of traditional discrete license applications over to SaaS models, which is proceeding faster than we anticipated a year ago. While the SaaS transition does not fundamentally change market dynamics, as it is more about how value is conveyed to the user than necessarily the elements of the value. It does change the measurement and requires augmented metrics to fully understand the health of the business. In addition to the need to invest in the SaaS conversion, we are making a number of discrete development investments that have beneficial implications for 2017 or 2018, but are placing some pressure on current performance. These are all aimed at new or extended revenue streams that require investment that is beyond the sustaining engineering to simply incrementally grow current sources of revenue. One is the continuing investment in Trimble Connect in the E&C segment. We have previously discussed this important initiative to drive up interoperability through the construction continuum. We have a unique opportunity to drive collaborative workflows from geospatial data collection that builds a digital model of the earth through civil engineering and building construction work that turns 3D design and engineering into physical structures. Another discrete investment decision is in the development of our data and software capability in agriculture. In the last six months, we have created one agriculture software organization to bring more intensity focus on financial transparency to this initiative. An early outcome of the initiative will be a major product announcement next week. We have also been making significant new technology investments targeting driver communities and third-party logistics providers in Mobile Solutions. These users have not been part of our historical market constituencies and represent meaningful new incremental growth opportunities. In prior quarters, the spending was referred to as an investment in new product opportunities to explain spending that was not consistent with our baseline model. Another area of discrete spending has been in autonomy. While our ambitions in autonomy are relatively modest against those of the primary players, we do have a number of potential technology contributions to make in the field (8:42) and are making incremental investments to establish market validity. Combined, these four development initiatives represent a drag of approximately 1.5 points on operating margins year-to-date and explain our recent higher than baseline R&D expenditures as a percentage of revenue. The effects of newly acquired businesses have also impacted results during the last year. While we've been relatively light on M&A activity, software acquisitions have tended to impact us negatively because of the need to take revenue haircuts to comply with revenue recognition rules. In addition, most of the smaller acquisitions have brought cost structures that take some time to reconcile with our model. The Engineering & Construction segment remains a dynamic story. Core civil engineering and construction delivered another relatively strong quarter with double-digit growth. The underlying momentum is being enhanced by our success in advancing our construction mixed fleet strategy through OEM deals. Earlier in the year, we discussed our agreements with Volvo, Hyundai and Doosan. In the last quarter, we came to announce couple of agreements with Vermeer and Dressta. While the incremental revenue from these deals is a plus, the greater significance is that they are placing Trimble at the center of the construction information ecosystem, which we can exploit in the aftermarket over an extended period of time. The BIM-centric building construction business slowed at least cosmetically in the quarter. Although improving, it did grow at the rates we experienced earlier in the year. However, after taking into account exchange rate effects and some one-time effects that were in the 2015 comparable results, the actual slowdown in baseline building construction results was relatively minor. This (10:34) business does have a disproportionate revenue weighting in the UK, and the recent uncertainties in UK have therefore had a meaningful negative impact on the business. The geospatial business remains disappointing relative to the expectations we held early in the year, largely because of the equipment overhang created by the oil and gas collapse. Even though geospatial market conditions are a challenge, the introduction of the model SX10, a breakout (11:03) optical geospatial instrument at the INTERGEO conference has been extremely well received; and we are currently revenue constrained by production capacity for the product. Although it does not eliminate the market problem, it does help to mitigate it. In the second quarter conference call, we called out Field Solutions for having a flat year-to-year revenue performance after nine quarters of revenue declines. This quarter, we can point to the first revenue increase in 11 quarters. Although there was some acquisition contribution, the core agriculture business increased and compensated for a decline in the GIS business. The Mobile Solutions segment's third quarter growth was led by transportation and logistics. Rob will further explain the dynamics, as well as our optimism about future margin improvements. Our position on transportation and logistics remains quite competitively unique and our coverage of both Mobile assets, as well as (12:03) and enterprise elements of the industry. This was clearly demonstrated in September, when we held our first combined user conference with PeopleNet and TMW. This is now the largest technology event in the transportation industry, with shippers, 3PLs, freight brokers, commercial truck load and LTL carriers, and private fleets and attendants. We had over 2,400 attendees, 350 sessions and 75 exhibitors. The Advanced Devices segment produced strong results in the quarter, although year-to-date results are roughly consistent with 2015. I have three final comments before turning the call over to Rob. First, our largest customer user conference is Trimble Dimensions, which is next week in Las Vegas. The first Dimensions was held in 2005, and this will be our eighth in the U.S. Attendance is likely to exceed 4,000, and attendees will be from over 80 countries. It represents an opportunity for Trimble to demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities, as well as a relevance to a number of different industries. Secondly, during the quarter, we completed our reincorporation in Delaware and in the process changed our corporate name from Trimble Navigation Limited to Trimble, Inc. While we are not placing undue importance on the name change, since our operational and strategic trajectory remains unchanged, it does recognize the fundamental change the company has undergone since its origination and in essence clears the decks for a non-constrained view of the future. Third point is to put the fourth quarter and 2017 in context. We have increased the conservatism of our outlook, given the apparent increased ambiguity about the direction of the U.S. economy, particularly as it relates to the appetite to make investments. Despite the apparently tougher environment, we do not intend to be victims to circumstances. Our company franchise remains strong, and we expect it to do comparatively well under all foreseeable scenarios. We'll postpone a more precise formulation of 2017 until the election dust is settled and policy directions are better formulated. However, our current expectation and management focus is to demonstrate revenue growth throughout 2017 and also to expand our operating margins year-over-year throughout the year, although there will be some sequential volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Rob?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Turning to slide five. Revenue for the third quarter was $584 million, in line with continued year-over-year progression throughout 2016. Top line growth was 4%, with currency translation having minimal impact at the aggregate level; and acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributing less than 1%. Organic growth has demonstrated progression throughout the year, and the third quarter continued that trend. Nevertheless, $584 million was $3 million under our guidance range. In looking at our results by reporting segment, Field Solutions, Mobile Solutions and Advanced Devices, all met or exceeded our top line expectations. Engineering & Construction fell short driven by the North American geospatial market and to a lesser extent building construction in Europe, with an offset of strong performance in our civil engineering and construction business. Our third quarter gross margin was 56.9%, down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis and up 100 basis points on a sequential basis. Third quarter operating margin was 19%, up 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis and up 280 basis points on a sequential basis. Many businesses experienced operating margin expansion, as our business leaders executed very strongly on cost reduction initiatives. Our net income was up 8% on a year-over-year basis and up 13% on a sequential basis, with earnings per share up 10% year-over-year and 14% sequentially despite the challenging market conditions. Cash flow continues to strengthen in relation to net income, in large part due to the mix shifts we're seeing in our business; and year-to-date cash flow from operations was $282 million. Turning now to slide six and reporting segment commentary, we'll start with Engineering & Construction. Revenue was $332 million, up approximately 2%, with foreign currency translation having a neutral impact and acquisitions having an impact of less than 1%. From an operating margin perspective, we expanded over 300 basis points sequentially, largely driven by cost reduction and expense management. On a year-over-year basis, operating margins were down 30 basis points, reflecting the relative weakness in geospatial. In our Engineering & Construction segment, we talk about the business as the sum of three franchises: geospatial, civil engineering and construction and building construction. Let's start with geospatial. We were down single digits impacted by continued headwinds in the North American positioning market. Our solutions are targeted at surveyors and geospatial service providers, nearly all of which use technology today. This market is, therefore, a replacement market more so than a new penetration market, especially in North America and Europe. On the heels of the downturn in commodities, we're seeing a more modest replacement of technology as many users continue to have idle equipment inventory. Looking forward, the strategic focus in our geospatial franchise is on product innovations. We launched two new major innovations at the INTERGEO Trade Show a few weeks ago. Steve already mentioned the SX10, which combines optical and scanning technologies into a new class of products and is the first of its kind to combine both 3D scanning, imaging and surveying capabilities into a single field unit, thereby greatly expanding the capabilities and services offered by surveyors and geospatial professionals to their customers. Second class of innovation is our TX6 and TX8, two new 3D laser scanners that offer more scanning capability at a lower cost. While our geospatial business remains challenged, our analysis shows us that over 70% of the top 100 survey in geospatial service companies in North America are Trimble customers. Our building construction franchise was up low-single digits. This was a departure from the high-single digit increases we've been experiencing in this business. Here, we have some puts and takes. Our architecture and design business continues to grow ahead of our own aggressive expectations and is at a record level of user activations. Elsewhere, the franchise did experience some negative effects of Brexit, with 200 basis points coming off top line growth based on the British pound, along with dampened macros in the UK as construction seems to be trying to establish a new norm. In addition, we continue to see an up-tick in our subscription offerings. This is coming slightly faster than we expected. With the up-tick of our subscription offerings, we're also seeing a corresponding decrease in our perpetual license bookings, which can have the effect of exerting pressure on the top line in the immediate timeframe. We remain confident of our competitive position in building construction; and to put this into perspective, I'll give you an example from our mechanical, electrical and plumbing business. In North America, we have 21 of the top 25 mechanical contractors, and 21 of the top 25 electrical contractors as customers. In the UK, we have 24 of the top 25 mechanical, electrical contractors as customers. Turning to our civil engineering and construction franchise, we were up double-digits driven by strong sales in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Revenue was positively impacted in Asia-Pacific by a government-sponsored technology initiative for smart construction in Japan along with strong OEM sales. European growth was led by Central and Northern Europe. Steve mentioned the new OEM relationships that continued to solidify our competitive position. Where we're seeing pressure from the macros is in North America where we were flat. This market pressure is consistent with what we are seeing from equipment OEMs, where businesses related to infrastructure moderated. Let's now turn to slide seven and review Field Solutions. Revenue was $78 million, up 6% with a neutral currency impact, with a positive 6% contribution from acquisitions net of divestitures. As previously announced, we acquired AGRI-TREND in the fourth quarter of 2015, which operates a network of over 150 specialists in North America that consult with farmers on agronomy, precision farming, crop marketing and farm business management. We also acquired Telog in the fourth quarter of 2015, which is a leader in wireless IoT water infrastructure monitoring and management solutions. Operating margins in Field Solutions were up 180 basis points year-over-year and down 90 basis points sequentially, driven by product mix and operating expense control. Beyond the aforementioned M&A effect, our GIS business traveling in sympathy with geospatial was down, while our agriculture franchise was up organically mid-single digits, driven by strong performance in Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Russia. Performance in the U.S. market was up as well. While most of our business occurs in the aftermarket, OEM sales are an important component of our agriculture revenues. We've been expanding our OEM relationships and are seeing these new OEM relationships helping to drive year-over-year growth. Many OEMs seek to work with Trimble as we are in a position of favor with customers in the aftermarket using Trimble as a unifying technology. OEMs also seek to partner with us because the pace of keeping up the technology cycles exceeds that of new machine cycles. In our definition of the endgame, starting the Connected Farm ecosystem is an aftermarket play. Our OEM strategy, therefore, is a complement to our aftermarket strategy as opposed to the strategy in and of itself. Our OEM relationships provide us with an end customer access point through which we can offer additional services, such as our Connected Farm software and data services. Moving now to Mobile Solutions, please turn to slide eight. Revenue was $139 million, up 5% with a neutral currency impact, with a minus 1% drag from acquisitions net of divestitures. Operating margins were up 240 basis points sequentially, benefiting from cost control and a growing subscriber base. Operating margins were down 140 basis points year-over-year, driven by product mix, for example, OEM sales and large customer orders and investment in new product initiatives, as Steve mentioned earlier. Year-over-year, our transportation and logistics franchise experienced double-digit top line growth. On a sequential basis, operating margins expanded. As expected, on a year-over-year basis, operating margins were down. Other Mobile Solutions businesses, namely Field Services Management, experienced lower growth in transportation and logistics and diluted overall growth of the segment. Our Field Services Management business is undergoing a conversion from a CapEx model on the hardware to an OpEx model, which had the impact of diluting short-term growth. We remain confident that we can expand margins in Mobile Solutions based on three factors: one, growth in the cumulative customer base; two, new SaaS solutions coming online; and three, monetizing nascent product development efforts that complement the strategy and leverage our existing customer base. Moving to our last reporting segment overview, Advanced Devices, as shown on slide nine, had revenue of $35 million, up 15% with a neutral currency impact and a minus 4% drag from acquisitions net of divestitures. To put this growth percentage into context, on our first quarter conference call, Advanced Devices was down on a year-over-year basis and we highlighted that we expected a annual growth and therefore the second quarter through the fourth quarter would be up. This is proving out, and the third quarter even exceeded our expectations. The gross margin increase in the segment, coupled with OpEx reduction, resulted in an operating margin increase of 540 basis points year-over-year. Some notable accomplishments in the segment included the release of our Thunderbolt Grandmaster Clock and NTP Time Server, which provide solutions to customers such as telecom carriers and network operators. In addition, we launched our M-Code GPS receiver for airborne applications. Finally, we are experiencing growth in solutions such as our combined GNSS-Inertial boards that are used in initial autonomy-related applications, as well as licensing revenue in the automotive segment. Before shifting the conversation to revenue by geography, I'd like to take a minute to point out one of the line items on our P&L, namely our non-operating income and expenses which falls below our operating income line. The specific line item called income from equity method investments mostly relates to our joint ventures with Caterpillar, Nikon and Hilti. We do not account for these joint ventures in our operating results due to the 50-50 ownership structure. Our joint ventures are closely linked to the operations of our business and have been successful businesses in their own right. Our portion of the income associated with these entities, if above the operating income line, would have added 90 basis points to operating income in the third quarter and 80 basis points year-to-date. Let's now move to revenue by geography and go to slide 10, which shows the distribution of total company revenue by geography, both for the third quarter discretely and for year-to-date. We saw some meaningful swings in the quarter that we felt were best complemented with the year-to-date perspective. One quarter rarely makes a trend line, and this would appear to be at least partially the case in the third quarter. North America was up slightly, with the U.S. flat and Canada up. Revenue was negatively impacted by Engineering & Construction, with growth up in our other reporting segments. Excluding the UK, our revenue from Europe was up slightly year-over-year and is up high-single digits year-to-date. Our revenue in the UK was down double-digits year-over-year and is down low-double digits year-to-date. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region was up double-digits, driven by Engineering & Construction activity in Japan, Australia and China. Turning to rest of world, specifically South America, revenue in the quarter was up high-double digits, driven by agriculture revenue growth in Brazil and to a lesser extent Argentina. Moving now to revenue mix, slide 11 shows us that our software, services and recurring streams represented 47% of our revenue for the trailing 12 months ending third quarter, up 1 percentage point higher than the comparable prior year period. Recurring revenue represented 28% of company revenue for the trailing 12 months, 2 percentage points higher than the prior period. Recurring revenues were up 9% year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. SaaS offerings are a growing portion of our current and projected future revenue base. Some of our businesses are shifting from a perpetual plus maintenance model to SaaS; and in other areas, greenfield activities are being developed upfront to be SaaS offerings. To make this more tangible, I'll illustrate with a couple of examples from our Engineering & Construction and Mobile Solutions segments. First in Mobile Solutions, we announced TripInsight, which will bring together capabilities from TMW, PeopleNet and ALK into the industry's first comprehensive journey management application and will be a SaaS offered solution. A trip planner using TMW for load planning and dispatch workflow can work within the native TMW application and use ALK's navigation engine, and then send it to the driver in the vehicle using PeopleNet technology. This optimized plan accounts for fuel stops, hours of service rest breaks, historical traffic, and vehicle and load-specific restrictions. Dynamic estimated time of arrivals for each stop become visible to the drivers and fleet managers, which are inclusive of real-time traffic and weather data. Also in Mobile Solutions, our TMW business continues to release additional SaaS offerings in areas of business intelligence, partner connectivity, fuel purchase optimization along with bid management tools. TMW plans to release additional SaaS products over the next few quarters. In Engineering & Construction, we are in a beta of a web-based version of SketchUp, which we plan to sell on a SaaS basis upon commercial launch. In aggregate, we continue to expect SaaS to be a growing portion of our revenue base; and we view these as expanding beachheads into more robust customer relationships. Let's now turn to slide 12. We ended the quarter with $276 million in cash and short-term investments, which represents an increase of $44 million from the second quarter of 2016. Our deferred revenue balance grew by 7% year-over-year and continues to help provide revenue visibility. Our cash flow from operations was $90 million for the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, benefiting from net income growth and favorable working capital dynamics in the quarter. We ended the quarter with our total debt at $670 million, $55 million less than the second quarter of 2016. We repurchased $10 million of common stock during the quarter, and we continue to view stock repurchases opportunistically. With that, let's turn to fourth quarter guidance on slide 13. We expect fourth quarter revenues to be between $562 million and $592 million. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.27 and $0.32. On the revenue side, while we expect positive year-over-year growth and continued progression, we are tempering our expectations a bit due to the macro environment, particularly related to our Engineering & Construction segment with our largest geographic area of focus being North America. We are following trends both from the construction and agricultural OEMs. We see the data on large expected crop harvest in North America. And we see the AIA data on new non-residential construction starts. Despite these potential headwinds, we have outperformed these negative headlines throughout the year as we focus on selling ROI and productivity to our customers. One revenue item of contingent note is that we do expect to complete several major customer contracts in the fourth quarter. On the bottom line, we expect to continue to benefit from the cost reduction and expense management activities that have taken place throughout the year. Two discrete items of note in the fourth quarter EPS guidance include, one, we anticipate a $6 million to $7 million increase in operating expense, resulting from the sum of our upcoming biannual Trimble Dimensions User Conference in addition to INTERGEO, which is our industry's largest geospatial conference, which took place a few weeks ago. While a significant expenditure, we feel strongly about giving back to our customers and partners and educating the market on our latest innovations. This $6 million to $7 million represents over 100 basis points of operating margin and $0.02 of EPS. The vast majority of this expense will impact the Engineering & Construction segment. The second item is M&A. Our guidance excludes acquisition activity, which could dilute short-term earnings. Finally, I would like to give an update on our medium-term operating margin objectives. We maintain the objective of reaching 20% operating margin on an organic basis with an eye towards further expansion over time. Progress towards that objective have been a bit slower than we expected, primarily due to lower top line growth and the key investments previously discussed, which we think are the right decisions for the business and shareholders. As we approach 2017, we believe we have levers that will enable us to expand operating margins while continuing to make those investments. Specifically, we expect leverage from continued growth in our core construction, agriculture and transportation franchises; and that growth continues to be weighted towards the heavier software and subscription mix. In addition, recently executed restructuring and divestment activities will have a positive effect on operating margins and benefit us through most of the year. Those factors combined give us confidence that we can deliver significant operating leverage throughout 2017. Growth above current levels would provide additional upside, and we continue to evaluate additional portfolio optimization activities which could have an additional positive impact. In closing, please note that we will be at the Goldman Industrials Conference on November 3, the Baird Industrials Conference on November 9, and the Wells Fargo TMT Conference on November 10. We will also be hosting an Investor Session at our Dimensions User Conference in Las Vegas on November 7, and we will webcast that session from our Investor site. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Hi.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Rob, you mentioned your deliveries in Field Solutions were ahead of the end market indicators by looks like an 8% to 10% range. I'm wondering if you could just frame for us the drivers of the outperformance? How much of it was new OEM partners and how much of it was new product introductions? Can you give us a sense, even if you're not willing to share the hard numbers, just to calibrate us? And how sustainable that is, the outperformance is heading into the fourth quarter?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure, Jerry. So really I would break into two buckets. The first is on geography and market penetration, and the second is the OEM relationships. From a geography and market penetration perspective, like give you an example of South America or Europe, Russia, where we've been seeing a positive year-over-year movement throughout the course of the year. And that continued and in fact accelerated here in the third quarter. So as markets, I'll use Brazil as an example, are adopting technology at an increasing rate, that is a favorable for us. And on the OEM side, we have a couple new OEM relationships which are continuing to grow and provided positive benefit to us in the quarter. So those are really the two main drivers of the outperformance.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And then, in Mobile Solutions, we have upcoming electronic logging standards regulations by year end 2017, and I'm wondering if you folks can talk about do you have the overhead, the SG&A investment in place to support a significant aftermarket ramp. And can you talk about the extent to which your backlog is building on the aftermarket side. Is that starting to play out yet?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So that is playing out. Throughout the course of the year, we've have a record amount of backlog specifically in our PeopleNet business, which would be the, let's say, the largest beneficiary from the ELD mandate that's coming. So, yes, that is a favorable macro for us and for the business. And then, we are seeing that play out in our backlog. And as it relates to the SG&A investments in the business, or I guess I'd expand that to say R&D investment as well in the business in order to capitalize on the opportunity, yeah, we feel quite strongly that we've made the incremental investments really over the last 12 months to 18 months to get us to the point now to be able to capitalize on this important market opportunities.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I just wanted to start with some of your SaaS commentary and I just wanted to understand or maybe quantify this a little bit better. Can you maybe give us a sense of how much of an impact came from, I guess, SaaS selections being higher than you anticipated on the license revenue? And where do you see that recurring revenue headed to over the long run?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So that's a good question. So let me isolate this from what may or may not happen on the hardware side of the business. But it's to say if agriculture – when agriculture comes back and, let's say, comes back strong, that would naturally impact the hardware revenue growth in the business and have an impact in a relatively way to, let's call it, recurring versus hardware in our portfolio. So if we call – we'll just put that aside for a moment and focus on SaaS. I think of it in three buckets. We have current businesses that are converting to SaaS offerings. We have greenfield development; and then we have our ongoing, I'll call it, organic growth from our existing SaaS businesses. So the organic growth from our existing SaaS businesses, think of that as a PeopleNet. It's been a SaaS model. We'll continue to be a SaaS model when that business continues to grow. Greenfield development, that looks like Trimble Connect that Steve talked about and TripInsight that I mentioned in my script. So new products right out of the gate will come from the SaaS. And then, current businesses that are converting to SaaS, a couple of examples to share with you. One would be in our building construction business. Our Tekla Structures product has a subscription offering in addition to a perpetual license offering. So we offer both to customers. And what we're seeing is that a higher percentage of customers are starting to elect the subscription offering. If we look at our TMW business, some of the core products are moving to SaaS, or ALK, where mapping and routing engine is also undergoing a conversion to SaaS. So if you add that up, I would say we're not quite ready to start putting numbers externally out there for the sum of those pieces. What I would guide you to is that they will be increasing overtime. And, again, leaving hardware out of the picture, I think the kind of growth I talked about on a year-over-year growth what's recurring is consistent with the kind of growth we would expect to see going forward.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, can you talk a little bit about how quickly some of the initiatives that you're investing in, the opportunities that you define, like autonomy, when will those sort of turn into revenue opportunities? And do you need to make additional investments to accelerate on some these newer growth initiatives?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, some of this is going to play out overtime. So, for example, there are existing revenue streams already in general realm of autonomy. We're currently building modules, component level, subsystem level modules, that are going into, let's call it, early-stage autonomous systems. And so, there are already revenue streams. Now, it's very early days and these are kind of at beta levels. And beyond that, I can't say much more because a lot of these are covered by very tough MDAs. So some of the revenue is already in existence, so the question there is how quickly and how big can it get. Others are, let's just say, we made references in Mobile to drive our user communities and to 3PLs, again, kind of the same stage, which is kind of beta level existence. And so, I think that what we would expect over the next three months to six months is increased market validation with the idea that in the latter stages of 2017, maybe as soon as the second quarter, that some of these start to be worthy of discussion in terms of actual revenue contribution. So I think that really we would expect – there are currently already revenue streams associated with this. So it's not entirely on speculation. But I would say, during 2017 we start to see evidence of more revenue, which starts to actually become more part of the story. And then, I think that the big news on most of these would tend to be more in 2018, but with some validation during 2017. Rob, anything to add?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: No. I think that's a good way to characterize it.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good afternoon, Rob and Steve.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hi, Richard.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Very quickly, could you just kind of walk through the margins in Mobile and E&C. And maybe my point is that in Mobile we had 240 basis points of sequential improvement in the op margins, but still maybe I'm not quite where you would like to see them by year end and I think the dynamic on the Mobile side there around hardware versus software sales. I guess the question is, sequentially does the op margin there continue to improve? And then maybe the same question on E&C, just sequential tone because, again, you're not getting the mix benefit in E&C and yet you alluded to more cost take-out. And I thought the 20.8% margin in the quarter was actually quite good without a beneficial mix. So just kind of trends here and how in those two segments of the business we should think about those sequentially?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So let me start with Mobile Solutions. So, yeah, we would expect to see margin progression as we move forward into the fourth quarter. And, yeah, the dynamics that take us towards that progression really are the same ones we've been talking about through the year is that cumulative subscriber base, customer base growth; and that's the software portion of the revenue stream. That starts to, let's say, outweigh the hardware installs that we've been working our way through throughout the year. Of course, we'll continue new hardware installations on an ongoing basis, but the size of the pie we see it playing out in a favorable way that continues to expand margin as we move into the fourth quarter in Mobile Solutions. And we also do have a couple of large customer contracts that, let's say, will be implemented and fulfilled or were planned to be implemented and fulfilled in the fourth quarter which have very high margins associated with them. So when we put those factors together, that gives us the continued conviction in Mobile to be able to expand our operating margin. If I got to E&C and the expansion of operating margin, there actually is a bit of a mix impact in E&C in the fourth quarter. And that is if you take the three primary franchises, geospatial, civil engineering and construction and building construction, building construction typically has one of its stronger quarters in the fourth quarter, particularly in a couple of the larger divisions within that business. And as that is a highly software-centric business, it does come with associated higher margins. And so, that for us would be a part of – actually really the primary driver of margin progression that we would expect to see in the fourth quarter.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see, okay. And then just one last question, a follow-up question. Steve, some of the infrastructure companies out there, Martin Marietta or Vulcan, some of these guys are expressing some solid optimism for 2017. Part of it could be election-related, part of it is just fast money. But I'm curious if you by any chance – do you share any optimism for 2017 when you look at the geospatial business or even to some degree the North American heavy civil business, the backlog, order tone, anything there?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, we remain largely a book and burn business. So any optimism we may have would not be in the form of kind of backlog.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Possible exception maybe being Mobile Solutions. So they may be in a better position to judge 2017 simply because they may have more metrics to look at. I would say is that, if you look at tone, the tone of this call is somewhat more cautious than the tone of the last call simply because I think we're seeing just more uncertainty in the U.S. And I chalk it up to, at least for the moment, as being kind of election uncertainty in terms of it's not clear kind of what policies will be in effect in a few months, or necessarily kind of what the likelihood for infrastructure spend is going to be. Now, if you look at what's being said is everybody is bullish on infrastructure spend. And the question is going to be whether there is a political ability to actually transform that into real spending. So I think on the one hand, given the semantics of the moment, I guess I would be optimistic is that the one thing where there seems to be bipartisan agreement is to spend more money on the infrastructure, which of course will benefit us. And so, I would say on that level, yeah, I would be optimistic. But, again, I think given the signs that we're seeing in the market, which is on a relative uncertainty compared to three months ago, I think our posture is to wait and see and get some real facts and probably talk more about what we see in three months. But for the moment, particularly in geospatial and I think that the other participants in our industry are kind of reflecting the same tone, it's just there is an awful lot of uncertainty at this point in time and I think we need to wait for that to dissipate before we have something concrete to say.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question on how you think about what the right investment levels are for the hardware pieces you are retaining in it? And, I guess, really at the root of the question is, are you running OpEx levels that are sufficient for more possible product cycles?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: You are breaking up a little bit, are you asking about the level of hardware investment we're making?
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. That's right. Sorry, if I was breaking up. Yeah. Just I'm trying to get a sense if you feel like the investment levels in hardware appropriate right now. And if you can continue to make those investments that you need at the OpEx levels you're targeting?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So the short answer is, yes, we feel the investments we're making in, I would say really R&D in aggregate for the company are in line and sync with the opportunity that we see in the near-term and near, mid, and long-term. And if you breakdown the investment we make in our more hardware-centric businesses versus our software-centric businesses, you could see metrics play out such as a percent of revenue that you put in the software company versus our more hardware-oriented businesses. So it plays out like you would expect. In other words, it's higher in the software businesses. But to turn back to your question, I think, it's important to note a couple of things that I'll highlight. The first is in our geospatial business, which is primarily a hardware business. And so, having product innovation is imperative to rejuvenating the portfolio and getting the business back into growth mode. And so, those product launches that I talked about are a reflection of the investment we've been making in R&D. The second example I'd give you from civil engineering and construction business, which is also predominantly a hardware business. I would look at the performance or the investment we make in our joint venture – actually plural, joint ventures – with Caterpillar, which are quite significant and I think by a good order of magnitude the largest in the industry with respect to investing in machine control technologies.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then, I guess kind of a bit of follow-up to that is like how are you measuring I guess perhaps the lack of impact from the FAST Act versus maybe they're just a lengthening of replacement cycles for hardware generally? I mean, any specifics or metrics that you can point to how you've measured the impact to those kinds of programs in the past? Thanks a lot.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah. So it's a good question and I guess I would say I wish I could provide you some magic insight into the impact of the FAST Act and what it means for our business. As we've said earlier in the year, we viewed that as instilling some confidence in the system that there was going to be investment there, but some of that optimism does seem to have dried up to an extent over the last few months. And I would probably sort of harken back to what Steve said a few minutes ago about let's let this election dust settle and then see where we come out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Kristen on for Colin. I just wanted to talk a little bit about you're seeing in your various channels here, the ISM numbers out today suggest we are seeing a little bit of a buildup in inventories. So can you just speak to what you're seeing across the various channels?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: And do you mean specifically our distribution channels or...?
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, yes.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Okay. I got you. Well, from an inventory, let's say, load perspective in our dealer channels, I would say we don't see our dealers being long on inventory at the moment. So if we were talking about some of the – let's say, OEMs might talk about their production versus retail demand, and that's really not a dynamic that plays out for us in our business. So in an aggregate sense, we feel good about where the dealers are positioned with their level of inventory now and don't see them as being overly long on inventory.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just switching gears a little bit, I wanted to talk about capital allocation. Obviously, M&A has been a little bit lighter than we've traditional seem to-date. We've seen you back in the market with buybacks, you've got a pretty low leverage ratio. Can you just talk about how you're setting those priorities for capital allocation if we are bracing for this continued macro sluggishness?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So our capital allocation approach really remains the same. As we talked about, our cash flow does continue to be strong. And our first priority really is in continuing to invest in our business, whether that's organic, let's say, primarily organic investment in the business; and in addition, M&A activity. So as you noted and as you've seen, the acquisition activity has been light this year, but I would say we expect to see some more activity there in the not too distant future. So we balance that investment, whether that's organic or inorganic, along with the opportunity to do opportunistic share repurchases. And really if I look at our CapEx level in Trimble, it's generally quite light. So that's usually not a huge factor for us in the capital allocation equation. And to your last point about if we were to see, let's say, the economy, let's say, I guess take a turn for the worse and I think given, like you said, our leverage ratio, we think we're in quite a nice position to weather a storm if there was one to come.
Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering if we could talk about the margin a little bit. Just wondering if you can quantify how much margin expansion you continue to see from the internal initiatives such as ongoing cost reduction, portfolio rationalization, as we look into 2017? And, Rob, you spoke about the 20% adjusted operating margin still as a target. Any idea on timing in that. Obviously, you look to 2017, but is that mid 2017, end 2017, just any idea there is helpful?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So on the op margin and 20% as we move into 2017, I think it's best to anchor with Steve's commentary that we'll hold off for the election dust to settle before, let's say, painting a view forward into 2017 relative to our view on timing of that margin. And I would really say, if not we'll backup from that and look at a couple of the factors. We'd be looking at our revenue growth assumptions, as well as our level of investment and our operating expenses and therefore the ability to generate operating leverage on that revenue growth. And so, really, I think at a high level think about revenue growth in kind of three different – call it, three different scenarios. If our level of revenue growth consistent with what we've seen this year, year-to-date, maybe a slight step-up from that, call that a mid assumption. Then you would have a level of revenue growth that would be below that and a level above that. In all scenarios, achieving operating leverage is really foundational to the strategy of the company. The level of operating leverage which you can achieve does correlate highly or at least reasonably highly to which tranche of that revenue growth is going to be available for us in the market. So it's kind of our, let's say, mental framework at a high level for how we'll think about planning the business as we go into 2017. And I hope here in the next, well, I guess really weeks that we'll start to have a little bit more insight into the market that will give us, let's say, a more definitive view that we can talk about with respect to 2017. Brett, did that answer your question or did you have something else?
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Year. No, no. That's helpful. Just one more question, wondering on the ag side, you spoke about regional growth and strength. But can you talk about in a little more detail in terms of adoption or the ramp-up of new offerings specifically looking at here in North America? And if you've seen strength from some farmers adopting some of those new technologies or new offerings, I should say?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So, yeah, I mostly talked about geographic – I am going to talk about geographic growth and growth with OEMs in the business. Really, a third one that I should have talked about earlier would be in the area of those new product offerings; and what I'm getting at there is the software portion of the ag business. So if you think about maybe in a simpler ag level sense, we create the digital prescription for the farm and we do that on our AGRI-DATA platform, so with our software. And then that goes to the physical – out in the field, right, to the tractor to be implemented. That's the strategy laid out is to create that prescription, and then get it to the equipment in the field and then you'll be able to create a feedback, which then enables ongoing analytics. The software business is continuing to, let's say, perform to our expectations. Those expectations will only get bigger overtime. And we're encouraged with what we're seeing in that business so far. And as Steve mentioned, bringing all our software entities in agriculture into one team under one leader, we think, creates the organizational context in order to execute upon the strategy.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Your line is open.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Hi, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: A little bit of clarification question, so I understand it. You mentioned in your prepared remarks and it came up in a question about a bunch of big contracts, I guess, in Mobile that are going to be booked and shipped, it sounds like, in this quarter. And I wonder if you can quantify that, because I'm really talking about thinking of 2017. And 2017 has a big hardware electronic device ramp-up also, and just wondering if we look at whether in that business – I understand the forecast – (01:00:02) but are we thinking more if that might have been at top line, but you shouldn't expect margin improvement in the Mobile side because of the increased hardware mix that's coming next year in the absence of these big contracts? I wonder if you'd give us some sense of how big these contracts are that bring or magnitude of also (01:00:17)?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Sure. So in terms of order of magnitude and what I was referring to in guidance with discrete number of contracts, thinking in terms of low millions, low single-digit millions of dollar. And so, that's kind of the order of magnitude we're talking about. And then, to put further I guess color on that, our offerings in Mobile Solutions cover fleets, enterprises, mobility applications, and the deals I'm referring to are in our enterprise side. So in other words it's really quite centric to our TMW business doing the – think of it as the ERP for the transportation company. And those can be larger deals with larger implementation cycles, and those implementations would come due here in the quarter so that we could be able to recognize that revenue. You need the customer sign off in order to do that, and getting that is a part of the guidance that we've provided. So that answers the first part of your question. The second part related to we move into next year and what ELD will mean to the business and what it could mean to the hardware margins. It's a good question. From a modeling perspective, yes, of course there is a dynamic of the amount of hardware demand that we see and what that will do to the margins in the business. And one of the things that we've – there's, well call it, a put and a take of the ELD mandate. The very favorable thing, the advantage here is that it's providing tailwinds to our business. In reality, yes, is also providing tailwind to newer entrants and to the market. So that hardware space of the business is a competitive space and would naturally then provide some, let's say, at least challenge to the hardware margins or at least throttles your ability to, let's say, price on the hardware. So we are conscious of how that will play out during the year and I think ultimately see what the demand is for which level of product we have, because we have solutions that are actually quite simple, that would be on the simple side, which would be cheaper. And then, we have really the higher end, let's call it, the fully capable, most capable solution steps that are in the higher end of the spectrum. So there is a mix within the offering that we have that will guide where the margins go. So we don't know exactly, of course, how that's going to play out yet, but we know the dynamics and the levers available.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Sure. But it wouldn't be unreasonable to think of maybe more top line and margins don't expand as much because it's hardware mix. Is that a fair scenario for next year in that?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yes. That is a possible scenario.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And then a further question. As part of your ag offering, you now have a partnership with Deere. So can you talk a little bit about what you're doing with Deere, is there a materiality to that stuff? Are you just providing software because there is a lot of aftermarket on the product. How does that work, I mean, Caterpillar is a fabulous deal that you, but I'm just trying to understand what you with Deere who is your competitor at the same time?
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: So, fundamentally, it's about interoperability of data. We talked about creating the prescription for the farmer with our ag software and the ability to get that out to the field and to the equipment. That could be equipment that's operating Trimble technology on it, or it could be equipment that has John Deere equipment on it. And whether it's a farmer or a construction company, mix fleets are a reality in the marketplace. So having that we think is an important relationship to have them.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Is it a hardware supplier or a software supplier or both? I am just trying to understand what...
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: No. It's really software, it's APIs.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: And, Eli, probably the other point of distinction here is, there are really two different sorts of relationships available here. One on the agriculture, which is obviously pretty limited just because the stance there is mostly competitive. On the construction side, there is a much wider opportunity for collaboration there.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And one final question, I mean, the Caterpillar dealers love your product or something. I mean, are we looking at ramping up or an expansion requirements in that part of the business as the Caterpillar deal is continuing to fall in love with your JV and your controllers?
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Given that we have two joint ventures with Caterpillar, I would prefer to say absolutely nothing and they would probably – it's a joint message to put out there.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Not a problem. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Fisher from Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.
Jon Fisher - Dougherty & Co. LLC: I have two questions. The first one, given your cautious tone and concerns on the North American, particularly U.S. market, I mean, given how well Europe, ex-UK, Latin America and Asia performed in Q3. What's your confidence in the sustainability of the non-North American geography performance and should we be concerned about those markets rolling over, whether it's Q4 or early part of 2017? And then the second question is, the Manhattan Software acquisition, why is that – continue to still be an issue? And if I remember correctly that was a UK-centric acquisition I believe. How much of the issues in the UK are actually directly related to Manhattan Software? Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - Trimble, Inc.: Well, let me maybe tackle the first and let Rob handle the second, which is again there's the scenario for every – yeah, there are any number of scenarios we could create for kind of what's going to happen with the world. Does Brexit somehow freeze up Europe, and all of this? And does Brazil in particular carried through with kind of a reform minded regimen and all of that. So there is lot of uncertainty out there. I would basically say that if you look at Russia, if you look at Australia, if you look at Brazil, if you look at a lot of these economies that we're pointing to as recovering, and I guess I would throw Spain, Iceland, Ireland into that category as well, basically these are bouncing off of a very rough foundation. Some of this goes back to kind of 2009. So, I would say, we've been through the kind of I guess, I could characterize it as a cyclical downturn. We hit bottom, we hit bottom pretty hard particularly in places like, well, any of those in fact. And so, I think these recoveries are not exactly rocket shifts at this point in time, I think they're comparatively modest recoveries that are founded in fundamentals and not necessarily speculative bubbles or anything else. So I would say is, yeah, with the conditionality that there are lot of moving parts out there at this point in time and a lot of things could happen to the downside, I would say is, I would look at these pretty favorably as being potentially lasting for years and pretty sustainable. So I would say is, the central questions at this point in time are U.S. simply because we've seen this uncertainty kind of come into the markets that really wasn't there three months or six months ago, and kind of the UK, specifically around Brexit. And frankly, the UK early part of the year was very strong. And then it was really the second quarters and third quarters where we saw kind of a screeching halt. So that's leaves us to believe that was very much Brexit directly or indirectly centered. I'll let Rob take a try in the Manhattan question.
Robert G. Painter - Trimble, Inc.: Yeah, let me answer the Manhattan question or address the Manhattan question. I'll try and do a fast version as we're kind of – I think we're over time. So to put our areas of emphasis in Manhattan in the context, I think one has to understand the underlying business model and there is a few product lines in Manhattan Software, the biggest two of which are Integrated Workplace Management Solutions, as well as space management. And when we sell that Integrated Workplace Management Solutions, it's called IWMS, and we're selling a solution that's got a seven-figure price tag typically and it has a long implementation cycle. That's typically weighted towards implementation by around professional services, resources. And so, when we put that context into a public company GAAP accounting, we and myself included underestimated the impact of that and that has us accordingly focused on three topics. The first of which is operational improvements. So move clients to a world-class hosting facility and we are increasing the utilization of our professional services, resources. And one of the way we'll increase the utilization of these resources is by increasing the product configurability versus the customization of the solution. So the more it's configurable, then the faster you can recognize revenue and the easier it is to engage within that work of implementation partners. The balancing act though is that we have some of the biggest logos in the world as customers and they've got demanding requirements. The second is completing a couple of discrete large implementations. But, again, those provide us with great logos and they've also been long-standing engagements to complete. So the faster we can get through this implementations, then that's the quarter we can get to our existing backlog. And then the third area is that of managing the business model. We've got to continue to build the backlog. We are continuing to the build backlog. And the business of backlog we think is healthy in the business, so that we can continue to have a business that grows overtime. The second is in the area of cost reduction, and we have made cost reductions in that business so that we can operate within the framework of what our short-term reality is in. And then we also looked at complementary metrics for the business. So whether that's cash flow, billings, deferred revenues, so that we take a full scope view of the business. And to your question about how much of that is UK impacted. There either would be a minor impact, but I wouldn't call it a fundamental impact as that business is a global business.
Jon Fisher - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: That is the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Michael Lesyna.
Michael W. Lesyna - Trimble, Inc.: Thank you, Tasha, and thank you everyone for attending today's call. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Shakira, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Todd, please go ahead.
Jim Todd - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks Shakira. I'd like to point out that our earnings release and a slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on our website at www.trimble.com, as well as within the webcast and we will be referring to that presentation today. Turning to slide two of that presentation, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated, due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP measures that we discuss in today's call are fully reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. With that please turn to slide three for an agenda of the call today. First, Steve will start with an overview of the quarter. After that, Rob will take us through the remainder of the slides including an in-depth review of the quarter and our guidance and then we will go to Q&A. With that, please turn to slide four and I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon. The second quarter was consistent with our expectations and supports the narrative for continued improvement in the second half of the year and into 2017. Overall, environmental uncertainty increased considering factors such as Brexit, recent U.S. GDP growth numbers and the U.S. presidential election. Nonetheless, our scenario for the second half of the year remains centered on a step up in revenue growth and margin expansion which Rob will explain in more detail. A very early and obviously incomplete view of the first half of 2017 also appears positive for continued improvement, driven by a combination of new products, market initiatives and improvement programs. The worldwide economic environment remains a general challenge, although we see some points of light. Europe grew double-digits in the quarter with comparative improvement in a number of the major economies, in particular, the Nordic countries, Germany and France. In addition, regions that previously saw precipitous declines are showing growth, including; Spain, Ireland, Iceland and Russia. The Brexit potential effects on investment confidence within Europe are at this point unknown. UK results were down in the quarter presumably as a result of pre-election uncertainty. Asia/Pacific was also up double-digits with strong contributions from Japan, Australia and Korea. Although the Australian recovery is fragile, the recent improvement is encouraging given Australia's relatively outsized role in Trimble's revenue and it's particularly weak performance in the last few years. China also grew, although not at historical double-digit levels. South America was flat with a drop in Brazilian revenue being offset elsewhere. North America was flat with a number of puts and takes which I will let Rob explain. Our efforts to restore and improve our short and long-term financial model continued in the quarter. Rob will provide a more complete analysis, but our efforts remain centered on cost management, portfolio pruning, performance improvement in a couple of businesses and leveraging revenue growth to the bottom line. Our anticipated rate of improvement in the model is being challenged by factors such as the temporary cost of our hang for new acquisitions and the load from hardware sales that are the front end to high gross margin software subscriptions. Overall, we expect to continue to restore our credibility in operating margin expansion through the rest of the year and into 2017. Pruning the product and business portfolio has been in the works all year and will continue for the remainder of the year. Last quarter we announced the divestiture or shutdown of our public safety business, transmission line planning software and Trimble outdoors. Although some of this ongoing effort will not be press released, it will create a beneficial incremental impact on financial results, as well as improve operational focus. Our strategic focus remains on our core businesses in construction, geospatial, agriculture and transportation and logistics as well as targeted emerging businesses such as forestry, electrical and water utilities, field service and railroads. The two significant businesses in the portfolio in which our emphasis is still on a performance fix are the field services business, which is in the Mobile Solutions segment and Manhattan software which is in the Engineering & Construction segment, both of which are not adequately contributing to financial performance. Field Services has been demonstrating an improving trend on revenue and margins within a SaaS-centric model, which leads us to anticipate an inflection point for the business in the second half with positive contribution in 2017. Manhattan Software remains a meaningful element of Trimble's Design-Build-Operate strategy and we anticipate it will demonstrate consistent improvement in performance, while marching towards the later contribution. The Engineering & Construction segment remains a mix story. Core civil engineering and construction delivered another relatively strong quarter with the momentum expected to continue. The underlying momentum is being enhanced by our success in advancing our construction mix fleet strategy through OEM deals. Last quarter, we discussed agreements with Volvo, Hyundai and Doosan. Other OEMs have been added but have not yet been announced. Others are in discussion. While the incremental revenue from these deals is a plus, the greater significance is that they are placing Trimble at the center of the construction information ecosystem which we can exploit in the aftermarket over an extended period of time. The BIM centric building and construction business stepped up its revenue growth rate from the level in the first quarter. Overall, we expect continued good growth for the remainder of the year. The geospatial business remains disappointing relative to the expectations we held early in the year largely because of the equipment overhang created by the oil and gas collapse. Our outlook for later in the year and into 2017 is somewhat brighter as the capacity surplus dissipates and as new products are released. Overall, we see the E&C growth rate accelerating in the second half of the year with operating margin expansion. However, the segment is the most exposed to regional investment confidence and Brexit following or other shocks could alter this view. For E&C, we continue to pursue the belief that technology can transform construction project costs and schedules through the application of a constructible model in the connected construction site. We made incremental progress in the quarter on developing this vision with the announcement of an enhanced collaboration with Autodesk and several product releases built on the Trimble Connect backbone. In addition, we announced work underway in mixed reality applications with Gensler, AECOM, and China State Construction Engineering Corporation. After nine quarters of declines in revenue, the Field Solutions segment was flat in the second quarter and is anticipated to grow modestly in the second half boosted by acquisitions. Core agriculture revenue was effectively unchanged year-to-year and is expected to continue to be relatively flat for the second half of the year. This contrasts with equipment manufacturers' views based on our strength of new products, strong performance in some regional markets, and expected actions in the aftermarket. The other elements of the segment had mixed performance with GIS trending down, both the emerging water and electrical utilities businesses demonstrating double-digit growth and expanding margins. Our belief in the medium to long-term picture for agriculture remains buoyant as it utilizes more data and information for making decisions. We believe we currently have both unique insights and an advantage participation in the market. For example, some form of Trimble hardware or software technology is used to farm 125 million acres worldwide, 250,000 Trimble displays are installed in farm equipment, and over 70,000 farmers use Trimble Positioning Services to achieve the accuracy required by their applications. This combination of sensors, analytical tools and physical control of applications places us in a strong position to serve in a primary role in the emerging, precision agriculture market. A key element of success will be the go-to-market strategy to bring these capabilities to the farmer. Actions during the quarter included the establishment of a new organizational structure, which more clearly differentiates our agriculture software and information capabilities from sensors and hardware applications and enables tighter market focus. In addition, we further enhanced our go-to-market capabilities by announcing a number of new Vantage dealers. The Mobile Solutions segment second quarter growth rate stepped up from the levels of the fourth quarters and first quarters and is expected to step up further in the second half of the year. We exited the quarter with strong backlog, which has been built on recent transportation and logistics wins, some of them unannounced. Operating margin development for the segment has not been strong in the first half as we originally anticipated, because of hardware and SaaS interdependencies. Rob will further explain the dynamics, as well as our optimism about future margin improvements. Our emerging strategic position in transportation and logistics is quite encouraging as a platform for growth. There are approximately 1 million vehicles with Trimble physical devices currently installed. More importantly, there are approximately 2 million vehicles in fleets being managed with Trimble Software Solutions. To further emphasize the point, about 200 largest private and for hire long-haul fleets in the U.S., 178 are currently Trimble customers. The combination of PeopleNet and TMW provides us with the strategic scope to embrace demanding requirements for both mobile assets, as well as the enterprise. In addition, the market is relatively fluid driven by factors such as the electronic logging device mandate and provides significant scope for innovation. The market opportunities are significant and we have added some discrete spending to pursue them, which has placed the model under some additional short-term pressure. We expect the model would begin falling back in place during the second half of 2016 and early 2017. The Advanced Devices segment which was a negative growth factor in the first quarter returned to its Steady Eddie persona in the second quarter and has anticipated to be a growth contributor for the rest of the year. Let me turn the call over to Rob. Before I do, let me characterize the second quarter as providing us with no major surprises other than Brexit, and fitting to the narrative of a steadily improving picture. Rob?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Steve. Turning now to slide five. This is an overview of our non-GAAP results. Overall, we delivered results that were in line with our expectations and we believe that we are poised to accelerate revenue growth and margin expansion in the second half of the year. Revenue growth is progressing as expected. Second quarter total revenue was $610 million, up 4% year-over-year. Currency translation had a neutral effect on our revenue this quarter. Movements in some currencies like the UK pound had a negative effect while other movements such as the euro had a slight positive effect. Given the late timing of Brexit during the quarter, the impacts were minimal and largely offsetting. Acquisitions contributed a little less than 2% to year-over-year growth and in combination with recent divestures the net effect of both was approximately 1%. Our second quarter gross margin was 55.9%, relatively flat as compared to prior year. Operating margin was 16.2% which was up approximately 100 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016, but down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Within the quarter, we saw operating margin progression in many businesses and we see a clear path to continued expansion through the rest of the year, which I will speak to during guidance. A natural question on our second quarter results will be to understand year-over-year operating expense growth in the context of revenue growth. There are roughly three drivers of year-over-year expense growth that offset our previously discussed restructuring events which reduced operating expenses by over $30 million on an annualized basis. First, recent acquisitions had a negative margin impact year-over-year at the company level. Over the past year, we have made a few notable acquisitions, among them AGRI-TREND in our agriculture business, Vianova in civil engineering and construction and Sefaira in our building construction business. All of these acquisitions are software services oriented, and we believe they significantly extend our strategic position. However in the short-term, these acquisitions are dilutive on the operating margin line as the businesses are integrated and as they cycle through purchase accounting effects. We see a clear path to cycle through these dynamics in the second half of the year and to increase margins in these businesses. Second, as we discussed last quarter, Mobile Solutions' operating margins have been negatively affected by the strong growth we are seeing related to recent large customer wins, which involve installation of low-margin hardware before the subscriptions become active. In the short-term, this puts pressure on gross margins as well as operating expenses in the segment. Looking to the back half of the year, this dynamic should change as those lower margin hardware sales begin to transition to higher margin software subscription revenues. Third, we have consciously chosen to make investments in a few key areas of our business where we see long-term opportunity. For example, we have invested in our Trimble Connect interoperability platform within our Engineering & Construction business. In Mobile Solutions, we have invested in head count to serve our existing backlog and to address new product opportunities. Working our way down the income statement, we generated increased operating income and net income in dollar terms. Earnings per share were $0.29, $0.01 higher than the comparable period in the prior year. Please note that the GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was lower than the non-GAAP tax rate due to a one-time benefit associated with the divestiture of Advanced Public Safety. Growth of software services and recurring revenue continues in our business. Related to that, our deferred revenue balance continues to grow up to $315 million in the second quarter, up 10% year-over-year. Cash flows remain strong in relation to net income, and in the first half of 2016, our cash flow from operations was $193 million. In addition, we repurchased $80 million of our common stock during the second quarter and we have repurchased $92 million year-to-date. Turning now to slide six and our segment results. Engineering & Construction had revenue of $351 million, up 4% year-over-year. Within Engineering & Construction, we continued to see favorable trends in our civil engineering and construction, as well as building construction businesses. Civil engineering and construction revenue was up double-digits and building construction revenue was up high single-digits. Both had a minor positive impact from acquisitions. The growth from these two businesses was partially offset by our geospatial business, which was down low single-digits in the quarter, but is showing a credible path towards growth and margin improvement. Overall, operating margins in Engineering & Construction were down slightly. Organic operating margins are up, but overall margins in the segment have been diluted by the impact of recent acquisitions. Looking to the second half of 2016, we expect to achieve solid growth in Engineering & Construction with corresponding margin enhancement. Moving to slide seven, we were pleased with our performance in Field Solutions. Revenue was flat at $87 million, in line with our expectations. That was partially assisted by acquisitions that had an approximate 3% positive impact year-over-year. Our agriculture business, the largest component of Field Solutions, was flat year-over-year as expected. We also ended the quarter with an increase in deferred revenue giving us increased visibility into third quarter revenue. We experienced about 70 basis points of operating margin improvement in the quarter through gross margin expansion and cost control, despite a slight margin drag from recent acquisitions. Looking to the second half of 2016, we expect to maintain improvement on the revenue growth profile and we are focused on generating strong operating margins. Moving to slide eight, our Mobile Solutions segment had revenue of $138 million, up about 8% year-over-year. The biggest driver of Mobile Solutions growth continues to be the transportation and logistics business, which was up in the low teens. Growth in the Mobile Solutions segment was also partially tempered by divestiture activity, primarily through the previously announced divestitures of Omega and Advanced Public Safety. Operating margins in the segment were down about 1% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, there were significant hardware shipments in the PeopleNet business, driven by the record backlog that we talked about last quarter from recent large customer wins; our contract with PACCAR and the rollout of our new video offerings. As we previously discussed, these strong hardware shipments are causing temporary negative dynamics on segment gross margin, because gross margins on hardware tend to be low. Our inventory position was challenged in the quarter, leading to significant expenses expediting product in the second quarter. In addition, we are investing in new product development initiatives. Looking to the second half of 2016, our inventory position is much improved and higher-margin subscription revenues will begin to have a positive impact leading to the expectation for operating margins to progressively improve in the segment with particular strength in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, we have line of sight to upside from recent acquisitions where we can release high-margin revenue on previously deferred contracts. Turning now to slide nine, Advanced Devices had revenue of $33 million, representing 4% year-over-year growth. Our operating margins in Advanced Devices held relatively steady. We have comparatively strong visibility to a pipeline that should generate modest revenue growth in the second half of 2016. Now turning to slide 10, we provide details on our geographics performance. The events in the UK have stimulated some questions about our exposure to currency translation going forward, especially with regard to the British Pound. Of the roughly 25% of Trimble revenue derived from Europe, less than one-fifth of that comes from the UK and not all of that business is denominated in British Pounds. To the extent that the dollar moves against these currencies, we will see a positive or negative translation effect, but we also have significant cost denominated in those currencies. Given this, we have natural income statement hedges that should minimize the impact to our operating income. Moving to slide 11. We continue to see an evolution towards a higher percentage of software and recurring revenue and we are seeing the evolution in all our major segments. For the current trailing four quarters, our revenue from software services and recurring revenue represented approximately 48% of total company revenue which is up from approximately 44% comparatively last year. That represents approximately $1.1 billion of annual revenue derived from software services and recurring revenue. Our recurring revenue streams, which are a subset of that, represented approximately 27% of total company revenue compared against approximately 24% in the comparable period last year. I would like to put a little more color on our recurring revenue profile as it is both strategically and financially important. Financially speaking, it's a material driver of our revenue growth. Not only in terms of recognized revenue, but also in terms of our growing backlog and deferred revenue balance. By segment, recurring revenue as a percent of total segment revenue was highest in Mobile Solutions with the PeopleNet and Field Service management businesses leading the way. In Field Services management, we recently pivoted the business model to ratably recognize hardware like we already do with the monthly subscriptions. While this creates a short-term decrement to revenue growth, we have been able to simultaneously increase our reported operating margins through cost control. Our TMW and ALK businesses are also seeing sharp increases in year-over-year growth in subscription revenue and are doing so in business models that offer both perpetual and SaaS offerings. Case in point, an ALK in North America, the subscriber count of our co-pilot professional navigation and routing staff offering grew 47% year-over-year. In Field Solutions, our growth starts from a low base of recurring revenue. We see the growth being driven by our Software Solutions group, which Steve highlighted earlier in the call. In Engineering & Construction, the predominant driver of recurring revenue comes from our building construction business. For new product development efforts, our bias is to invest in SaaS models. For example, this quarter, we released a beta version of our highly successful SketchUp product on the web, which we believe will be a transformative delivery model. For many of our existing products, Tekla Structures for example, we offer both perpetual and subscription options. We find many of our customers require on-premise software, whether it be for reasons of connectivity and remote field conditions, or for reasons of customary buying behavior. In fact, we are seeing an increased take-up rate on the Tekla subscription offering. This is creating a slight negative drag on the year-over-year growth we would have otherwise experienced. In this soft transition towards subscription, we are able to preserve our operating margins. In summary, we have a number of different reporting software delivering models across our reporting segments. Our view is that SaaS will continue to increase importance, and we will diligently work to plan for revenue and margin impacts associated with this growth and will also do so within the context of new revenue recognition standards coming online in 2018. Moving to slide 12. Trimble is in a strong financial position. Our cash balance ended the quarter at $232 million. Our total debt balance at the end of the second quarter was $725 million, which represents a growth debt-to-EBITDA multiple of approximately 1.7 times within our target range. Moving now to slide 13 and third quarter guidance. We expect third quarter revenue to be between $587 million and $617 million and non-GAAP EPS between $0.28 and $0.33 per share. Our third quarter guidance assumes current FX rates and a minor negative impact from currency translation. To add color to our third quarter guidance, I'd like to walk through a bridge of how we modeled the second half of the year progression. In the third quarter, we see operating margins improving sequentially by roughly 150 basis points and in the fourth quarter, we expect both a sequential and year-over-year operating margin gain. Looking forward to the third quarter and fourth quarters, I would like to break down the three levers of operating margin expansion, which are revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and cost management. First, revenue growth. In Engineering & Construction, we expect continued growth in the building construction and civil engineering and construction businesses, factoring in some conservative for Europe, specifically in the UK. We expect an improved growth profile in our geospatial business, for example, government deals in the third quarter. While the oil and gas hangover effect has proved stubborn, the good news is that we have broadened our customer base, which we believe positions us well moving forward. Within Mobile Solutions, transportation and logistics will be the driver with continued rollout of large deals. In Field Solutions, the story of agriculture continuing a path of flat or better year-over-year growth comparables. The second lever is gross margin expansion, which is directly related to the revenue mix from the growth drivers I just discussed. We expect to see gross margins up sequentially in the third quarter and at a yearend high in the fourth quarter. Finally the third lever is cost management. Earlier, I walked through a bridge on operating expenses for the second quarter. The same levers play out as we look forward into the third and fourth quarters. Two things to emphasize here: one, product and portfolio review. We have discussed a few divestures and product line shutdowns this year, and we expect those to have a positive impact. We continue to diligently review underperforming parts of the business. Two, we will continue to take cost reduction actions as necessary to preserve and improve the business model. We take these actions on a business-by-business basis and the context of the growth and profitability profile. Also note that Q3 operating expenses are normally down from Q2 due to seasonal dynamics, and we are expecting that this year as well. To conclude, between a favorable strategic position in our end markets and continued progression in the business model, we feel encouraged about where we are heading in the second half of the year and as we look into 2017. We will now take your questions.
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to start out with your comments around Brexit and some of the potential impacts. Can you maybe describe for us some of the slowness that you're potentially seeing and maybe where you see that impacting your business the most on the Brexit side?
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think we have a particularly refined view of Brexit effects. I think that we did see the UK down a meaningful amount in the second quarter. We assume that the investment climate was such that everyone was waiting to see what happened before they made any investments. So I don't think there is any one-to-one correlation between what happens mechanically from the Brexit process onto our results. I think it's more a matter of whether Brexit triggers a set of wider issues, second or third order effects relative to the self-confidence within Europe and the willingness for businesses to invest. So I think it's more, let's call it, at the moment a more rhetorical question in terms of whether it affects the investment climate within Europe, particularly in places like Germany and France, and whether businesses postpone decisions waiting for clarifications. So again, I don't think – there may be other businesses. There may be other industries where there is a more linear alignment between Brexit mechanics and business. I don't think we're one of those. So I think it's just more a point of caution at this point in time to see whether investment decisions in terms of investing in infrastructure or investing in capacity or the like are postponed and just waiting to see what happens when the dust clears a little bit. So I'm afraid I can't be very helpful on the question, Jonathan, just because I think it's just a generalized point of concern on our part, but nothing overly direct or at this point in time even meaningful.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And I know you guys gave a lot of detail around your second half acceleration expectations, both for the top line and operating margin improvements. But you also talk about this persisting into 2017. So I'm just wondering what underpins your confidence around these trends continuing into the early half of next year and maybe what some of the top drivers are behind that confidence.
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, let me comment and then let Rob maybe get a little bit more surgical on it. I think part is where is the real Trimble, what is the real Trimble here. I think for the last 18 to 24 months is, okay, the dialog, the narrative around Trimble has been dominated by agriculture, first of all and on the first, second and third order effects from the oil and gas price collapse. And so I think that in part, I think what we're trying to communicate is the real personality, the real capability of the company is beginning to reassert itself, as agriculture is no longer a net drag on the company and as we touch zero on the oil and gas effects and there is no longer a net change there. So I think that the fundamental drivers coming out of E&C and out of Mobile Solutions in particular are asserting themselves with some potentially buoyancy coming out of Field Solutions. So I think the point is less a net change than a return to a level of normalcy within the company. But, Rob, do you have anything to add on that?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: I think, if you look at it from a reporting segment level, whether you're extending to the second half of this year or into 2017, you could really look at our three primary segments in the business between Engineering & Construction, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions. And if you look at it from a Field Solutions, as Steve said, if as we return to let's say a better performance in agriculture, at least on a comparable basis, and we hold the margin, that's an important lever to the Trimble model expansion, business model expansion. And Mobile Solutions, that of course has been the fastest growing segment in the portfolio this year, and as we see that growth continuing, it's also the lowest operating margin segment in the company at this time. And so that's the place where we have the headroom to expand the operating margins, and we have the growth profile we see behind that to support that. And then Engineering & Construction, which of course is the largest reporting segment that we have, we see the positive trends that we talked about within the civil engineering, construction and building businesses continuing. We catch some wind in the sails on geospatial and generate operating margin expansions, and you've completed the, at least mathematically, the story to continue into 2017.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon and good evening.
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm wondering if you could talk about within the transportation and logistics business, how you expect the cadence of inflation to play out over the next couple of quarters. I would guess that the pipeline is building as we get closer to the regulations, but maybe you could flesh that out for us. And out of the total trucking fleet, I guess, how big do you expect the addressable market to be in terms of those that are expected to be required to install the electronic logging standards? Thanks.
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: So if you were to look at the – I'll speak to North and well obviously I speak to the U.S. market, this is the U.S. regulation. We believe there's around a couple million vehicles that are impacted by the need for the electronic logging devices. Now of course, not all of those are relevant to Trimble. So when we segment that 2 million, there's let's just say less than 1 million that become more of a relevant market opportunity for Trimble. And so from an addressable market standpoint, there is certainly quite an opportunity out there. We see that reflected in the sales pipeline we have today as well as the bookings and the deferred revenues in the business. You asked about how the installations play out here in the coming quarters. And we have spoken, as you know, to the surge in demand through a couple of the discrete large customer orders that we've had. And as those implementations continue really for the next, I'd say, two to three quarters, before were fully implemented on those couple large orders, then I would see returning to what maybe a little bit more of a linear path of growth in the implementations and then mathematically, right, as the subscriptions kick in at higher margin, that's where you get the margin expansion in the business.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And, Rob, on your comments regarding margins improving sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter, can you bridge that for us? I think that's only happened once out of the past five years. So I'm wondering do you expect deferred revenue burn or just what gives you that visibility on margins improving sequentially versus normal seasonality in 4Q?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Good question. So the first one, let's just stick with Mobile Solutions and the margin expansion in that business, particularly from the transportation and logistics business. So very discreetly just about the topic we were on with the – as more subscriptions come on top of the hardware. They're also in Mobile Solutions. I think I mentioned this in my script. We have, from an acquisition coming off, it's purchase accounting effects that will add back some positive operating margins for us in the fourth quarter. So there are some effects related to acquisitions rolling off the purchase accounting, that's a negative effect we experience usually in the first year or so in a deal on top of the growth in Mobile. And Field Solutions really a story of let's call it stabilization but year-on-year progression from that perspective. And then E&C, of course, that has multiple pieces to it. One of the larger quarters that we have in Engineering & Construction is historically in our buildings business. And the buildings business is predominantly software business with associated margins that are higher than the rest of the portfolio. And as buildings becomes a larger portion of E&C, that plays out into the math to support the margin progression story.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. A question that's really a continuation of the last one, which is this next quarter, 3Q, you are calling for about 7% revenue growth at the midpoint year-on-year which is good. The narrative is uniformly good about the margin improvement that you anticipate for the three reasons that you stated. And yet the EPS guidance really does not call for much leverage. And so I'm just wondering is it just because it's going to take a while for the leverage to kick in or why is 3Q EPS guidance not a little bit more encouraging I suppose?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: So there is a time element of leverage kicking in. From an EPS perspective, there is a slight impact on the non-operating income side that we look at happening in Q3 relative to Q2.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Well, my other question is that, Steve, in your prepared remarks you talked about the momentum into first half next year. You talked of products innovations and of market initiatives. I was just wondering, can you just elaborate a bit? Maybe you already have answered this and just kind of semantics, but what do you mean by market initiatives?
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Well, yes, so I'm going to be decidedly vague here since I don't necessarily want to preannounce from a competitive standpoint products or market initiatives. But I would say is in the script I talked to both in Engineering & Construction and transportation and logistics within the Mobile Solutions segment talked to new products. I think that we believe we have some significant new ideas, both in terms of products themselves but also new product categories that can add incremental market pieces to the revenue flow. I think I would say in particular in those areas, I would say within the Field Solutions segment, without necessarily hanging ourselves out too far, I think there is a steady progression within agriculture moving more and more towards precision agriculture. So I think the relative emphasis we're putting on AGRI-TREND, the fairly recent acquisition. And the fact that we're investing relatively heavily to build up this go-to-market capabilities also would be what I would call a meaningful market initiative of accelerating the movement into precision agriculture. The reorganization we did to put more emphasis on the software and solutions as part of that. So I would say in each of those three segments, there are again I think meaningful developments on the product side, okay, which will tend to bring increments of revenue. But then I would also emphasize then in some cases there are new product categories that bring, let's call, potentially larger increments of revenue. But clearly, at this point in time, it would not be prudent for me to identify very specifically what those are. So I'll just have to leave you hanging, Paul.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good afternoon. Steve, could you put a little bit more color, or Rob, could you put a little bit more color around North America being flat? We've got some puts and takes there probably, but I'll let you just go through those real quickly, because I would think that some of the markets there would be showing some pretty good growth in North America, some of the end markets?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Good question. At a high level, North America was flatter year-over-year. We had growth in Engineering & Construction and Mobile Solutions and I think that's what you would have been expecting as you were thinking about the reporting segments. The agriculture business is still weak in North America and maybe then the extension of that statement would be that for our ag numbers to have worked out, that meant outside of North America we have experienced good growth, relatively good growth.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Has the rate of decline in ag in North America, has it now flattened out in North America?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: I would say flattening out, yes.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Flattening out. Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just I had a similar question on the op profit. I think you just covered some things at the highest level here for Trimble going forward. But what kind of cadence of improvement should we expect in the E&C op margin? If we are at 17.6% for the second quarter, the third quarter, I think, seems like it would be better, fourth quarter better yet. But is that mix with the geospatial business? You alluded to Manhattan needing some work. Maybe you could just refresh us there where Manhattan is and the impact there it will have on the improvement in E&C margin.
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, sure. No problem. And in fact, when I talked about North America being flat year-over-year in Engineering & Construction, the point of particular weakness in Engineering & Construction in the quarter was in our geospatial business. That is where we still are seeing the hangover effect post the oil and gas I guess we call it a collapse or decline in North America. As we're cycling through that, as we've broadened our customer base and we look forward into the second half of the year, we see improvement coming in the geospatial business. Third quarter also happens to be a time where, at least in this particular market, government orders typically occur. And so between that and the cycle-through dynamics on geospatial, we do see that being an important positive contributor to the progression of the E&C op margins in the second half of the year. You asked about one other thing. What was that?
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Manhattan's impact on that business. When you put the mix in there for geospatial and we start to be able to recognize more of the deferred on Manhattan presumably. Do we get to a 20% op margin in the E&C business in Q4?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Let's say we're approaching that 20% level. And let me address Manhattan and then come back to the 20%. So the Manhattan Software business, I think, if you go back, no, it's not probably quite a year, but you go back some number of quarters, we talked about that and in the context of a margin point, it's less than a margin point now. So maybe it's a little less than half a margin point. It is progressing, but it's not where we want it to be or where we need it to be yet. From an accounting P&L perspective, and it's one of those businesses it's important to look at the deferred revenue that we have, the backlog, the pipeline and the cash flow that complements it, because the P&L can give us an incomplete view of the business. Nevertheless, of course, that's important and that business on an absolute basis, we continue to work at it to improve it. And then your question about does that improve in geospatial when you take the pieces and you start to add up the margin progression. One of the things that happens in fourth quarter, say, from your modeling perspective is we have our Dimensions User Conference in the fourth quarter. So that's one where we will see a set of expenses come onto us on the fourth quarter that would otherwise mask some of the margin improvements that would get us closer to the level you're talking about.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, all right. So maybe fair to just suggest maybe 100 bps in Q3 plus and then another 100 bps in Q4, I mean, that kind of cadence?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: I think I would, say, think about it from a whole second half of the year perspective on an out basis, and probably safer for you to model which quarter to quarter it happens.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of James Faucette.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I had a couple of questions. As kind of staying on the topic of continued profitability improvement, can you talk a little bit about how much cost cutting has already occurred and it was fully built into the second quarter versus what is remaining and how much of a contributor continued efficiencies and OpEx may be able to contribute?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: So last year, the restructuring activities of 2015 were at a level of about $30 million on an annualized basis. That was from 2015 actions. Year-to-date, we have another set of actions that would be above that level. Now they're more recent, so we wouldn't have seen much of that in the second quarter. As we start to look forward into the back half of the year, we would start to see some benefit of that. So, the easy answer is to look at the $30 million, divide by four and you have got a quarterly progression there. We've also done some, the divestitures we talk about that add a little bit to that. And pretty soon you can be, depending on which quarter we're comparing, call it a $7 million to $10 million a quarter positive impact.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then looking at your investment priorities, it seems like you've been making channel push for both BuildingPoint and Vantage. When should we expect to see benefits from those efforts? And is it appropriate to think about those or the leverage coming in on those once you have already surpassed your 20% target or do you think that eventually getting leverage on BuildingPoint and Vantage will be central getting to that 20% level? Thanks.
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So first of all, I think particular, well, it's I think BuildingPoint, Vantage and SITECH's are all targeted third-party channels for us. And I think that our confidence is growing based on recent evidence that again from your perspective kind of disappears into the dust. But I think our confidence is growing that all three of them, SITECH's I think relatively well establish as being a competitive needle mover and creating a combination together with product. Of course that creates unique competitive differentiation. It's still early for both BuildingPoint and Vantage, but the metrics are supporting the views that by putting a BuildingPoint in or putting a Vantage dealership in and getting, let's call it, the increased emphasis on technology, it does make a difference quantitatively in terms of the performance of a particular region. So I think our confidence level there is growing. And again against our – it's not adding cost, so I think in terms of margin improvement, it would be really more of the effect of getting the incremental leverage from the channel and, okay, converting that into profit, that increased revenue with a operating leverage of hopefully 25% or greater and converting that into operating income. So I think the story is both dynamic in the positive sense and I think will increasingly be a factor in adding incremental revenue that will in turn turn into bottom-line results. So I think we're comparatively pleased with the progress in all three distribution channels.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: I just wanted to revisit the operating margin progression question again briefly. Last quarter, you had mentioned a target of 20% plus or minus I think 100 bps exiting the year. And listening to your sort of qualitative commentary, it sounds like you could certainly be approaching that sort of 19% exiting the year, but you didn't mention that again. Just wondering if you could comment on that. Thank you.
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: I think you probably characterized that correctly. But approaching that 19% exiting the year is a possibility for us. That's how we are thinking about the business in the second half of the year and trying to poise ourselves to exit the year as we come into 2017.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. And then with respect to Mobile Solutions, certainly a lot of good qualitative commentary there in terms of converting from the real heavy hardware phase to more of a subscription SaaS. Can you give us any sense of, or kind of remind us where you see the operating margin for that business progressing numerically? Like what's sort of maybe your medium-term and longer term operating margin targets for that Mobile Solutions business? Thanks.
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I would say it's safe to say that for what we would consider a threshold performance for any of the businesses would be 20%-plus operating margins, and higher the more software-centric given businesses and that's the nature of much of the business within Mobile Solutions from a working like endgame backwards, or let's call it, our intention level is to be above 20% in that business. And I think you're asking how do you step into that from an operating margin progression. I think really, this is the game of cumulative subscriber base, and I call it new product developments that can extend the value of what's already on the vehicle. So, if you think about the video intelligence system that we launched earlier this year, and it's been a quite a successful launch we think by most any measure. That's extending a capability to a current customer to further penetrating a customer with additional technology on the vehicle, on the fleet. So, between addressing new customers, additional technology under existing customers, looking at the portfolio, like Steve mentioned, how many of the top 200 for hire, and private fleets that we addressed today in the portfolio in Mobile Solutions, those customers that Steve talked about, the 170 plus where we have a customer touch point at Trimble, many of those may be just one of the products in a portfolio is at those 178 customers. So, there's an opportunity there in a sense, so you add that together and you start to have the pieces of the margin progression.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Any sense of the timing to get to that?
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: To get to the level?
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah.
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: So, from a reporting segment perspective, let's really think about it in two pieces. The transportation and logistics part of Mobile Solutions, which is the biggest part of the portfolio, and you'd have our Field Services Management business. So, mathematically, we need both to perform. Field Services Management, as we mentioned, we believe has turned the right direction and will continue on that path. So with the expectation of our Field Service Management business performing and the Mobile Solutions business performing to get, let's say, north of 20%, we don't see that, it wouldn't be our expectation for how we exit on a calendar year perspective, as we start to think about – we think about the business going forward. I'd probably tag another probably 12-plus months on to that. And that could have a function of how much new sales we're getting from customers, how much hardware growth that we do get, continue to get, let's say, big orders that could be a bit of a throttle on to that. But that's a throttle I think we would be a good problem to have, let's say.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Thanks for that color, Rob.
Robert G. Painter - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Welcome.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics by segment? Obviously, there's some fairly sizable strategic moves being made with some of your businesses by competitors. If you just talk a little bit about any pricing pressure, maybe opportunities to creep prices higher that would be great to get a little bit more detail on that?
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I guess, I would launch by just saying at this moment in time, I think pricing across all the segments is comparatively steady and stable. I think that when it comes to the hardware element, particularly in kind of the general telematics realm, the expectation is that hardware prices are going to drop. And potentially drops significantly. Now our strategy is comparatively hardware agnostic, so that is not necessarily a consideration. And as you've heard us during this whole session in effect playing up that hardware gross margins, there isn't a whole lot left to give out there. So I would say, that is the one relatively dynamic element relative to pricing where we can expect significant pricing pressure, which is on the hardware elements, kind of the telematics realm. But again, it's not core to our strategy. I think otherwise I would tend to say that the environment is generally comparatively steady. In some cases we have successfully been able to raise prices, particularly upon release of new product generations where we are bundling significantly more value into the new product generation. And just looking at the elements within E&C, civil engineering, again, I would characterize it as there are dogfights on individual deals, but comparatively steady there. Kind of on the building side, I would say there's significant opportunity to maybe bundle different elements of the solution into a complete package and achieve a level, let's call, pricing leverage there just from the significant value by providing a bundle of capability playing well together. So I'm actually saying the longer term there is potentially to realize more value through pricing on the building side and to some extent, even on the civil engineering side. Geospatial, I think in terms of base capability, instrument prices are likely to drift down over time. But I think the opportunity there is to bundle those relatively dumb instruments that provide positioning data together with software solutions and create kind of new bundles of value and with an opportunity to increase prices from the bundle. And I think there are some fairly dramatic examples out there where dumb instruments have been coupled with software, incremental cost approaching zero and being able to double or triple prices of that otherwise dumb instruments. Agriculture, and kind of in the Field Solutions realm, I'd say that there is the traditional hardware elements, the guidance elements which has got a 15-year track record of being, again fairly stable from a pricing perspective in terms of at least not step changes. I think the opportunity there is adding software content and essentially capturing more value and then on the mobile side, again, I think there is software element which provides value at the enterprise level. There's relative pricing leverage there through the value creating and then on the hardware side that's likely to see some pretty major decreases over time driven by technology. So overall, I would describe the environment as neutral to maybe positive in a three-year context.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thanks so much for the detail on that. And then as you are introducing these new products, what's your expectation for the trajectory in R&D spending? Are there going to be a number of new initiatives once these products get launched or are we going to see a little bit of relief on that R&D line?
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that in terms of percentage of revenues being spent on R&D, I would say that we are generally running hot at this point in time. And I think it would be our intention both by design and I think just circumstantially to see that number come down over the next 12 months.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Steven W. Berglund - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And that is the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Todd.
Jim Todd - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, Shakira. With that, we'll end today's call. Thanks for attending and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-29 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Jim Todd - Director, IR Robert Painter - CFO Steve Berglund - CEO
Analysts: James Faucette - Morgan Stanley Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird Rich Valera - Needham & Company Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray David Rose - Wedbush Securities Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Britney and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Jim Todd, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd: Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release which is available along with additional financial information on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Although the first quarter provided some puts and takes from our original set of expectations at the beginning of the quarter, we remain on track for the 2016 scenario we laid out in prior calls. Our themes remain the same. First the worldwide economic environment remains a challenge and is generally providing us with no favors. The expectations may be Europe which is continuing to show signs of recovery in our markets. Second our focus remains on the recovery of our financial model in the short and long term. Third our strategic position remains advantaged and the market potential significant. We're therefore mindful of balancing short term financial progression with strategic outcomes. While the first quarter results were within guidance they are only a way station on a return to the financial performance we're capable of reestablishing and maintaining. Rob will speak to some of the complexities and limitations associated with the income statement in the midst of a changing business model. For example we recorded an all-time high deferred revenue balance in the quarter which grew by $37 million from the first quarter last year. This in combination with the first revenue growth quarter since 2014 supports our view of mid-single-digit growth for the full year absent significant currency impacts. We understand that arithmetically the total year view imbeds an expectation of step up in growth in the second half which is supported by what we see as improving trends in transportational logistics, Buildings, Heavy Civil and agriculture. Providing additional encouragement is demand in the month of April which has been more robust than prior years in the seasonal businesses of construction and agriculture.  This could be weather, secular trend or a combination of both. It is nonetheless encouraging if precise. We have repeatedly spoken of regaining our financial model during 2016 with the definition of success being in the neighborhood of 20% non-GAAP operating margins. Neighborhood in this case implies being within a point plus or minus and convincing enough to remove any doubt about our having reset our structural model back to that level. From a portfolio perspective Field Solutions and Advanced Devices were both above 30% for total year 2015 and our contributors to the model. Mobile Solutions was at 16.5% for total year 2015 and only 13.9% for the first quarter. The major reason was the receipt of multiple large contracts with a heavy weighting toward hardware in the quarter that will lead to richer software subscription margin later in the year. With the dynamics at play Mobile Solutions should be within striking distance of the 20% threshold later this year. E&C is at the core of our margin restoration efforts. Segment produced operating margins of greater than 20% in 2012, 2013 and 2014. And fell to 17% in 2015. We believe we have specific steps in place to restore the E&C model and thereby elevate the entire Company. In prior quarters we have recited a list of rationalization actions we're taking. Let me reiterate that list. The first is cost reduction. We took steps throughout 2015 to bring spending in line with altered realties and this process is continuing into 2016. The reductions have been focused in those areas that are facing revenue issues particularly Field Solutions and [indiscernible]. On the other hand we have continued selectively add in areas such as transportation logistics which has significant revenue momentum.  We're also running R&D hotter than our base model, with the expectation of having a rich product release year. It is still our intention to dial R&D back to our traditional levels of 14% to 15% of revenue. The second initiative is the pricing of the portfolio of non-strategic businesses, products and product categories. During the first quarter we announced the divestiture or shutdown of three product lines. The first was a part of our public safety business; the second was a planning software package for transmission lines and the third was Trimble outdoors. This process will continue as we focus more intently on our franchise business in a handful of emerging businesses. The third initiative is the consolidation and leaning out of the organizational infrastructure that has grown up through our acquisition. One significant element of this will involve the elimination of unnecessary legal entities acquired through acquisitions with our corresponding costs. The fourth initiative is to consolidate organizations and operations in to more cost effective configurations where possible. Some of this effort is already complete and some is ongoing. This has involved consolidating number of selling and manufacture organizations to gain better cost leverage. A fifth initiative is the ongoing consolidation of product platforms by sharpen focused on [indiscernible] decisions for hardware elements of our product solutions and the reduction of redundant or low value R&D activity. Across the regions the story remains a collection of pluses and minuses. The U.S. is positive but somewhere short of robust. Canada reflects the commodities bust and the struggling. Europe reflects improved momentum in our major businesses but remains in our mind tentative pending events such as the upcoming U.K. vote. China remains a positive in the mid to long term but short term decision making is paralyzed due to market volatility in policy and decision. Russia may slowly be coming off the bottom and was a growth market for us in the quarter. Other markets such as Brazil, Australia and South Africa are problematic. Although Australia showed strong growth in the quarter. The outlook for Argentina which is a significant agriculture market is now hopeful. The E&C segment is a mix story. Heavy Civil delivered the strongest relative quarter we have seen in almost two years and surprised us to the upside. This momentum appears to be continuing into the second quarter across all major regions. Also adding momentum in Heavy Civil are the recent boosts to our mixed fleet strategy in construction through the announcement of OEM deals with Volvo, Hyundai and [indiscernible] with more in discussion. While the incremental revenue from these deals is a plus, the greater significance is that they are placing Trimble at the center of the construction information ecosystem which we can exploit in the aftermarket over an extended period of time. The unique advantage in developing these OEM deals has been the SITECH channel which allows Trimble to supplement the OEM dealers with [indiscernible] support as needed or desired. Last quarter we describe the likely year for Heavy Civil as muted given the headwinds in core markets such as Australia, South Africa and Canada with some potential of uplift from the U.S. Highway Bill. Our expectations have improved in the last three months and we expect a greater contribution from Heavy Civil during the year. Although the BIM centric buildings business remains a strong plus for the year and into the future, it stumbled in the quarter due in part to the GAAP revenue accounting for delays in receiving customer acceptances which either have arrived after quarter end or are expected in this quarter. Overall we expect the buildings business to generate double-digit revenue growth for the remainder of the year. We were anticipating a relatively strong come back for the Geospatial business in the quarter which did not materialize particularly because of continued slowness in North American. The used equipment market has become saturated with equipment surplus from the oil producing areas and it will take some time for the overhang to work itself through the market. Last quarter we described the outlook for Geospatial for the year relatively robust single digit growth. With a better understanding of current circumstance our revised view is probably best reflected as modest single-digit growth. Overall we see E&C back on the growth path for 2016 with the potential for significant expansion in margins. Our view on agriculture remains unchanged from prior quarters with the expectations for the year being flattish at the revenue line with flattish implying a relatively narrow range around zero. Although agriculture was down in the first quarter as expected our view for the rest of the year is for consistency with last year's revenues which may contrast with equipment manufacturers views results from a combination of new products, strong performance in some regional markets and expected actions in the aftermarket. There are dynamics at work for us that contrast to a simple correlation to new machine sales. For example [indiscernible] units installed in the world wide aftermarket on equipment more than two years old is running at more than 50% of the total with a substantial portion going on units more than five years old. This demonstrates the continuing viability of the aftermarket channel as a technology delivery mechanism and the penetration potential on the installed base. The vantage channel which is our [indiscernible] third party agriculture distribution channel focused on technology is providing early and still tentative superior results to other channels which reinforces our belief in the effectiveness of the channel. Overall for the Field Solutions segment with expect revenue to be up low single digits for the remainder of the year with an assist from acquisitions. The Mobile Solutions segment first quarter growth rate was consistent with the fourth quarter's rate. We exited the first quarter with record backlog and we continue to expect an acceleration of growth through the remainder of the year based on recent transportational logistics wins some of them unannounced. The new product pipeline consisting of the mobile gateway and video intelligence has been well received. We continue to anticipate this segment to be the strongest performer within the Company for total 2016 producing both double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. The Advanced Devices segment does not typically enter in to our quarter end commentary because it is peripheral to our end user strategy focus and not particularly significant against the scale of the other segments. However this year with the significant year-to-year drop in the first quarter revenue the segment effected the optics of the aggregate financials. The segment tends to be inherently lumpy because of the nature of its product and customer base and its reliance on large contracts and specific customer delivery schedules. We're confident that the first quarter drop was a function of last year's very strong first quarter and we expect to see modest full year Advanced Devices revenue growth, with the growth spread over the remaining three quarters. Let me turn the call over to Rob. Before I do, let me characterize the first quarter as being the quarter we expected, with again a couple of puts and takes with the ags recorded results providing a less than ideal set with our full year narrative of revenue growth and margin expansion. If one looks beyond the moving parts, we believe it does provide support to believe in progression quarter-by quarter during the year. Rob?
Robert Painter: Thank you, Steve. Before getting to the numbers, please note as usual that unless otherwise indicated, the operating results I will discuss today will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is in our earnings press release, along with the financial data by segment. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. Let's now turn to the first quarter results. Q1 total revenue was $583 million flat year-over-year. Currency translation subtracted approximately 1% year-over-year and the net effect of acquisitions and divestiture added approximately 2% year-over-year. Turning to our revenue by segment I will start with engineering and construction. Engineering and construction segment revenue of $310 million was up 4%, with improved year-over-year growth. Currency translation subtracted approximately 1% and the net effect of acquisition and divestiture added approximately 1%year-over-year. Within E&C the revenue performance was mixed. Heavy Civil revenue grew double digits through a combination of organic and acquisition growth, with strength in most regions. Our confidence continues to grow in this business for the rest of the year with positive momentum as we enter our seasonally strongest quarters in the segment. Trimble Buildings grew single digits overall, lower than expected due largely to some renewal delays and delayed revenue recognition on a small number of large contracts. We expect performance to rebound to recent patterns. Geospatial revenue was down single-digits in Q1 with continued weakness primarily in the North American market. We expect some improvement but we have muted our growth expectations through the rest of the year. In the Field Solutions segment revenue of $106 million was down 8%, currency translation subtracted approximately 1% and acquisition had an approximate 5% positive impact. In line with our expectations the agriculture business was down high single-digits impacted negatively by difficult markets in North American and Brazil with healthier markets in Europe and Asia. While the agriculture market remains very challenging we continue to expect our year-over-year growth profile to improve during the course of the year. Mobile Solutions segment revenue of $136 million was up 6%. Currency translation subtracted approximately 1% and acquisition had an approximate 1% positive impact. Within the segment T&L which is our transportation and logistics business was up high single-digits as expected. We expect growth to strengthen through the year with backlog at record levels as a result of large customer wins. The rest of the segment was relatively flat year-over-year. Advanced Devices segment revenue of $31 million was down 22%, due primarily to weaker OEM sales than we experienced in Q1 2015. As we have previously discussed, Advanced Devices revenue can be lumpy due to the timing of these sales. Note Q1 2015 was the strongest quarter last year in Advanced Devices and represented a very challenging comparison. We expect year-over-year growth rates to improve through the rest of 2016. By geography our revenue split was as follows; 54% from North American, 26% from Europe, 14% from Asia-Pacific and 6% from the rest of the world. North American was up 1% year-over-year. E&C improved significantly double digits lead by strength in Heavy Civil offset by soft performance in Geospatial. Field Solutions was down double-digit in North American with a challenging quarter as expected in agriculture. And Mobile Solutions grew single-digits led by T&L. Europe continued to be a positive story with revenue up 5% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation effects, revenue was up approximately 8%. Geographic performance was mixed with the U.K. and Germany slightly down improved by strong performance in France. Italy and the Nordic regions. Russia improved in the quarter from prior year. Asia-Pacific revenue is down 9% year-over-year as recorded. Currency translation subtracted approximately 1% year-over-year. Asia-Pacific performance was uneven and patterns are currently hard to establish with declines year-over-year in China, Japan and Korea partially offset by the first quarter growth in Australia that we have seen in almost two years. Rest of world was down 8% year-over-year. Currency translation subtracted approximately 2% year over year. Brazil was very weak offset by growth in some areas of the Middle East and Africa. Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margins at 55.9% were down 90 basis points. This is at the low end of our expectations which was the primary reason for our performance on the low end of our EPS guidance. The biggest impacts on gross margin year over year were geographic mix in Field Solutions and the impact of increased hardware mix in T&L within Mobile Solutions. Furthermore Advanced Devices with [indiscernible] margins represented a smaller portion of the overall Company in Q1 2016. In Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions we expect to see gross margin recover in the rest of the year as more traditional mix trends reestablish themselves. Next to put non-GAAP operating expenses into context this represented a $3 million year-over-year increase in the quarter. Compared to last year the numbers were roughly as follows. Restructuring activities reduced OpEx in line with the $30 million of annualized expense reductions we talked about last year. OpEx for newly acquired companies roughly offset these savings. Finally we're investing in growth initiatives primarily in our T&L business which we expect to benefit us in the second half of the year. With respect to operating income, Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $88.5 million or 15.1% of revenue as compared to 16.6% of revenue in the prior year. E&C operating margins were up year-over-year due to revenue growth and cost containment with a positive momentum as we enter our seasonally strongest quarters in that segment. Field Solutions margins were down year over year impacted mainly by lower revenue and gross margins, but remained above 30% due to cost containment actions. Mobile Solutions margins were down year over year as we expected due to gross margins and operating expense investments related to growth in the business. Acquisition closed in the last 12 months also had a slight negative impact on operating margins. Turning to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. Note that our GAAP tax rate was 33% against a GAAP tax rate of 23% in the prior year, impacted by discreet items in the quarter which negatively impacted GAAP EPS year over year. So Q1 2016 non-GAAP net income of $64.5 million was down 11% as compared to Q1 2015. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.25. Back to revenue, from a mix standpoint we're continuing to see an evolution to software services in recurring revenues and we're seeing that in all of our major segments. For the trailing 12 months through Q1 2016 the combination of software services and recurring revenue represents approximately 48% of total Company revenue up from approximately 42% for the trailing 12 months through Q1 2015. Recurring revenue which is a subset of that, represented approximately 27% of total Company revenue for the trailing 12 months through Q1 2016 against 24% for the prior year. It is increasing clear that revenue mix shifts in our business towards software and services are positively impacting our deferred revenue and cash flow profile. Q1 operating cash flow was $113 million up 6% year over year. Closely linked with the cash flow performance deferred revenue increase to a record $320 million up 13% year-over-year. The increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects changes in revenue mix, currents large contracts and acquisitions. Debt decreased by $55 million sequentially ending at $675 million. Our leverage ratio defined as gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ended at 1.6 well within our targeted range. During Q1 we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares of our common stock for $12.2 million. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Our first priorities are long term investment in the business organically and through acquisition. We continue to produce strong cash flows. With relatively low levels of CapEx in our current acquisition pipeline we expect to continue to be opportunistic with stock repurchases. Our current stock repurchase program has a remaining authorization of approximately $238 million. I will now turn to our guidance for Q2 2016. We expect second quarter revenue to be between $595 million and $625 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.31. Second quarter guidance assumes current FX rates and a neutral impact from currency translation. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $40 million related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition costs of $2 million, the anticipated impact of stock based compensation of $14 million and approximately $4 million in anticipated restructuring charges. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assumes approximately 255 million shares outstanding and a 24% non-GAAP tax rate. I would like to take a moment to summarize the drivers behind our conviction of achieving upward momentum and operating margins during the remainder of the year. There are three main drivers; revenue growth, gross margin expansion and expense management. I will provide a few examples of each of these drivers. First revenue growth, we anticipate strong relative growth in the back half of the year. Drivers of this revenue growth include but are not limited to Mobile Solutions. We entered Q2 with a record backlog in T&L which is coming from recent large customer wins as well as from the [indiscernible]. This backlog provides high visibility to revenue growth in the back half of the year. In E&C, Buildings and Heavy Civil have strengthening trends which will also drive material revenue growth. Buildings for example is largely a software business. Growth in 2016 license sales comes on top of a solid basis support in maintenance revenue. In TFS we expect growth due to geographic shifts and new product releases. To be more specific the addition of software and services is beginning to move the needle as are product releases which bring us into a new class of lower horse power equipment. We also continue to see positive revenue growth in markets outside of North American. Second for gross margin expansion in E&C we see growth in Buildings revenue driving overall margins up. We also see our Geospatial business returning to a more normal albeit more muted level of growth in margins. In T&L the backlog I mentioned will turn into increased subscriptions with corresponding higher margins in the upfront hardware revenue. Lastly in terms of expense management, we're implementing additional cost control to protect the model and we continue to review our product and divisional portfolio for rationalization opportunities. Added together, these effects have the potential to deliver high single-digit revenue growth and significant operating leverage in the back half of the year. With that, during the second quarter we will be presented at the JPMorgan Technology Media and Telecom conference in Boston on May 24th and the William Blaire Growth conference in Chicago on June 15th. We will now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
James Faucette: Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask quickly about the confidence of improving mix in geography in the latter part of this year. Just wondering if you can give us a little color. Is that related to new product launches and ramps, et cetera, any color you can give there. I'm sure people will ask, it seems like your construction and engineering is decoupling a little bit from the other indicators that a lot of time we see in the industry. So if you can talk a little bit about where you are seeing the drivers in construction engineering. Thanks.
Robert Painter: Relative to the geographic mix the specific market I highlighted in my comments was relative to Field Solutions specifically in the agriculture division. What we're seeing in the agriculture I will give you an example from Q1, is we experienced stronger revenue growth year-over-year in Europe, Russia and Asia-Pacific were as we saw negative year-over-year growth in North American. As you of course move through the year in agriculture and the planting cycles as they work around the world that plays itself out in geographic mix in Field Solutions as we move forward through the course of the year. And that would be really the one geography I would point out outside of North America in one particular. The other one I did call out as well was in Geospatial. In Q1 our North America performance was weak relative to our expectations and we see that coming back as a percent of the overall business better in the rest of the year. So that is the geographic mix.
James Faucette: Sorry, just to interrupt. So basically what you are looking at is the typical seasonality across geographies so that should drive better performance later in the year [indiscernible].
Robert Painter: In Field Solutions -- there would be two parts to that one would be yes to your question the typical seasonal mix. On top of that we have seen basically a strengthen position and I'm talking ag at the moment. A strengthening position in those markets outside the U.S. in other words they are more robust as well. So not only do you have a seasonal shift but you have more robust markets we have been experiencing in those markets.
Steve Berglund: Ands far as your question on the civil construction. At the most general level would say is again we're selling technology that does decouple us in terms of the drivers versus other indicators that may relate to equipment sales or the like. So I think -- I think it plays out on the regional level which is U.S. Highway Bill has hard to quantify precisely one effect or the other, but certainly on an anecdotal basis the passage of the highway build has solidified confidence in the relevant group of contractors who can now look to multiple year funding they look to their own competitive profile against that future more likely funding and they start to say, okay, are we competitive or not in terms of going and get this business. And I think that has led to an investment cycle on their part to be ready to be competitive for this future spending. Then I think a large part the heavy civil thing plays out kind of on a regional level. For example although Australia is hardly robust but after a couple of years of really heavy hits Australia is stabilizing. Most of the first quarter upside in Australia was actually agriculture but construction is more solid than it has been really for a couple of years. So I think Europe is also strengthening. Two weeks ago was the BOMA Exhibition which is the biggest construction show in the world. The mood in Germany was certainly very bullish relative to the prospects for the year. So I think we're starting to see the effects of that. I think it is not one thing; I think it is a number of things. But I think this is playing out in a regional basis where markets that have been missing in action for a couple of years are starting to come back to life albeit at a lower level than they may have been two or three years ago but they are starting to show some signs of life.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Steve or Rob, could you go back over for a second in the Mobile Solutions business you addressed the op profits here, the non-GAAP op profit and the margin there. I think you said there was growth investments there which I think makes some sense and then some acquisition that closed in the quarter. The step down there year-over-year is noteworthy I know the business is growing you have a good backlog but just speak to what the expectations is for the profit margin there as the year starts to play out here with the backlog in the growth.
Robert Painter: Sure. This is Rob. I think Steve might have covered this as well in his comments. In Mobile Solutions we expect to be near a 20% operating income level we see that as directionally achievable for the year. Now let's start to go back to the beginning of your question relative to the margin performance, the operating margin performance in the quarter and how to put that in context. I do so in a couple of ways. Primarily let's talk about the hardware versus the subscription impact in the transportational logistics. So the way the orders and really the revenue play out in that business is let's say you get an order. And in fact this quarter we have had very large orders. We had our single largest order we have ever received and we had record backlog coming out of the quarter. As you are fulfilling that hardware and you first fulfill the hardware before you turn that subscriptions on that hardware has far lower gross margin than the subscription does on an ongoing basis. So the first dip you take when you have an order of magnitude, basically it was a nonlinear change in the hardware implementations that we did during the quarter that has an impact of driving the gross margin down. Now as the hardware units get installed and they come online into subscription you now go the other way and margins come up in the business. That's the first part of the answer and the second part would be of course, it is a subscriber business therefore accumulative subscriber business and as that cumulative subscriber base grows and the revenue expands now I have got that margin percent on a higher revenue base and I am getting operating leverage expansion out of that.
Richard Eastman: Is the subscription in your description the subscription actually comes online then when the truck is sold? So in other words, we record the revenue and the op profit on the hardware to let's say PACCAR and then when that truck is sold to the end customer is that when the subscription comes on?
Robert Painter: Let's talk about OEM versus aftermarket. The vast majority of our sales and transportational logistics are aftermarket sales. So depending on the customer let's say they have a fleet 100 or a fleet of 1,000 some customers may choose to roll out in waves or in stages and others may choose to turn them all on at one time. There is not a singular prescription for that. It in that case it is not about the sale of a truck it is about the fleet implementing or I should say installing the hardware and then turning on the subscription or turning on the software service. On the PACCAR side the primary sale that we have it is actually sales to PACCAR so they are placing orders or the OEM is placing orders with us, so upon delivery of our units to that customer that's when we recognize the hardware revenue. There is a second part of it which would be how do you turn those into subscription that would happen sometime in the future after the truck has been sold and the customer chooses to install or I should say turn it on.
Richard Eastman: Can I just as a follow up and maybe just to expand that conversation for one second. As a follow up when I look at the second quarter guide and I walk my way up the non-GAAP P&L I'm coming in to an EBIT margin that is 15.2% to 17.1%. Granted there is not that much sequential revenue growth from the first to the second but obviously your comments about the second half and the margin improvement across the board in these businesses to get to 20% plus or minus a point for the full year your plan kind of dictates op margins, non-GAAP op margins in the second half that are 22%, 23%. That's what your plan looks like?
Steve Berglund: Let me jump in to clarify maybe on two points just because I think there is some poor communication on our part. First of all I think clarification of what Rob say. What I heard Rob say could be inferred as 20% for the full year operating margins for Mobile Solutions when in reality we're talking about being there towards the end of the year. The second implies to the full Company which is again maybe we miscommunicated here but the idea here is to reestablish 20% by the end of the year as the norm for the Company. Yes, I would agree that the arithmetic for the full year would be daunting and not terribly credible. So what we're talking about is operating margins in the neighborhood of 20% by the end of the year and with particular emphasis on the second half of year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company .
Rich Valera: I was hoping you could flush out what you see accelerating the growth in the ag business in particular in the second half. I know you have some new products I am wondering if you can talk about any more specifics on them and how significant just comps are and how are the comps in the second half versus the first quarter which you saw the high single-digit decline. Thanks.
Robert Painter: Let me talk about on the new product side. We have been increasing, I will give you a few examples, the software and services content that we have in the ag businesses starting to get to point of some significance, enough significance where it can start to move the needle. And we have talked about some of our acquisition I think over the course over the last few quarters I will give you one example being [indiscernible] to establish for us a relationship with the [indiscernible]. We see that strategy playing out and starting to bear some fruit for us. On the hardware side which is really the bulk of the business still today and probably what we're best known for in ag. From a new product perspective we have a new display it is called a MMX display. And with this MMX display this gives us an entry price which is lower with a lower entry price point that helps us not only in emerging markets but also to get on to lower horse power equipment in a market such as North American. And with that lower hardware platform the way it has been designed and built is such that you can then expand the capabilities over time to allow for upgrades for instance. So that is some color on the product side of agriculture that is driving our belief set in the rest of the year performance.
Rich Valera: How about irrigation that has been rerolled out. Is that expected to get some traction here?
Steve Berglund: I think in general in terms of irrigation, yes, it will be a lift starting probably late second quarter into the year. The learning on irrigation which probably follows very much the same pattern as we have historically discovered in construction is that it is not a consumer product. It does not take off instantly. There is a trial period. So a farmers who may need 30 irrigation systems in total may try it out for the first year on one. So that process really began last year. We would expect pick up on that during the course of this year and continuing. It would be against maybe the expectations that we had maybe a year and a half or so ago where being an enthusiastic technology company we knew that demand was going to be instant and universal. It is turning out to be again a very classic Trimble sort of product which is prove it and build momentum over time by proving the technology. So it is a seasonal business. As we move deeper into the year we'll be into what I really second effective selling season for irrigation. I would expect it will lift the second, third and fourth quarter particularly second and third quarter. But again I think it will be progressive as opposed to let's call it a step function.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you can bridge for us in buildings just some context behind slowing customer sign offs. In the quarter it looked like you showed some progress in the back half of 2015 in getting the sign offs done and I am wondering what drove the step back this quarter? And also based on your second quarter implied guidance for margins it looks like you are not counting on revenue burn accelerating sequentially; is that a fair way to interpret the mid of the guide?
Robert Painter: Can you clarify your revenue burn comment?
Jerry Revich: Yes, deferred revenue booking into revenue.
Robert Painter: So with the deferred revenue, I will start there, with the deferred revenue balance that we have that will play itself out over the course of the year more so the second half of the year. This definitely doesn't just drop in Q2. There will be a linearity throughout the rest of the year. On buildings specifically I will give you a couple of examples of what I was referring to in my comments. First if you look at our Manhattan Software business, basically that business has call it a relatively small number of transaction each with a high dollar amount associated to them. We had a small number of contracts where we had push out of customer acceptance from Q1 in to Q2. What you have then is you have the accounting effect of taking the cost in Q1 but not the revenue that's associated with it. So come Q2 for that revenue stream you would take the revenue with very little cost. That's one of the impacts. We had a small number of contracts where this happened. The biggest one we have already here in April in the first few weeks achieved the acceptance from the customer on the contract and now have that in our April and therefore Q2 revenue. Another dynamic in the buildings business is about this time of year you are going out and you are getting maintenance renewals from customers and if the customer pushes out that maintenance renewal from March and pushes out until April I now pushed some revenue from March into April. And that is another one where we can look here in the first few weeks of the quarter and we can compare the April results we have in the first few weeks to that of April the first few weeks last year. It is up high double-digit, so I can see from a fact based perspective that revenue is now in Q2. So those would be some of the examples to bridge your revenue questions in buildings.
Jerry Revich: And then in Field Solutions can you bridge for us the year-over-year margin performance you mentioned [indiscernible] mix. Can you just flush that out for us. I think last quarter you had a positive mix impact on a year-over-year basis, so I'm wondering what drove the variance. And I know you have been working the cost structure over the past couple of quarters in Field Solutions and I'm wondering what was the offset; why didn't that drop through in the quarter? Thanks.
Robert Painter: The primary impact came from geographic mix. The product we're selling outside of North American is sold overall at a lower margin than that of North America. And we had -- I know I have referred to so far in the call that we have experienced higher growth outside of North America and we had a decrease in North American so with the mix in geography that actually had an impact on the gross margin line, a negative impact on the gross margin line. Also I would say we had a discreet impact in the quarter relative to as the shipments were coming in or the orders were coming in reasonably strong at the end of the quarter outside of North America we actually were expediting some orders and that drove some additional shipping expenses for us that nicked us on the gross margin a bit.
Operator: Your next question come from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray.
Brett Wong: Steve, just for clarification it sounded like you are actually seeing increase demand in heavy civil from contracts ramping up from the highway bill, just wondering if that is correct. And if by any chance you can provide a little more color on your thoughts around what kind of growth you think that will drive.
Steve Berglund: Again I don't want to create the impression of false precision relative to our ability to measure FX. As I said we were surprised to the upside by the relative strength to demand both in the U.S. and around the world. And I think in terms of more at the anecdotal level in terms of what explains this relative uptick in demand the conversations typically are coming back to the highway bill. So I think that -- I would attribute a significant amount of the buoyancy in the U.S. to the highway bill. But I would say kind of as a background factor because it has created confidence within the contractor community enough confidence to start an investment cycle in anticipation of a multiyear pretty firm spending profile. I would say it is significant. Almost interesting factor is that we're seeing an uplift in heavy civil demand worldwide in markets where we haven't seen it. So I think it is a worldwide phenomenon not exclusively U.S. What I would say is that in general sense if we were talking about relatively muted growth a quarter ago it was okay, let's call it relatively low single digit, I would say in a very preliminary fashion I would characterize it as being high single-digit at this point in time and maybe with aspirations for even more which would be a real change in temperament in Heavy Civil over the last two years. I think the highway bill is a contributor but not the only factor contributing to the change in view point.
Brett Wong: You talked about some of those margin expansion initiatives at the very beginning can you talk about the removal of tax code basis and the reduction you are expecting this year and really the target you have in a given year of kind of cleaning up those legal entities. And then maybe with that if you can list the most important cost reduction or margin expansion efforts in that kind of portfolio rationalization cost reductions, this legal entity reduction that would be helpful.
Robert Painter: I will take the questions. There is a few parts there so you are probably going to have to remind me of one or two of them. You asked about the tax code and impact on sales. I presume you are talking about the ag business at the end of last year; is that right?
Brett Wong: Yes.
Robert Painter: Okay. So I would put that in the same category probably as highway bill as hard to characterize to a degree of precision of how much volume that drove for the business. I think it is fair to say that it had an impact, it had a positive impact at the end of last year which probably takes you to a logical conclusion to say that lead to a drop off in Q1. Our Q1 numbers from a revenue standpoint came in as per our expectations, so it didn't come to us as a surprise the Q1. How much it had an impact overall and whether you want to attribute it to Q4 or Q1. It would be in the low millions in our assessment of revenue. Okay. So your next question was relative to legal entities and simplification and what kind of opportunities for improvement that could lead to; is that right, Brett?
Brett Wong: Yes, that's right, Rob.
Robert Painter: So we're a Company who has acquired a goodly number of businesses over the -- well, not just the last, you know, the last 17 years, 15 to 17 years as I look at Steve. And through the course of that has certainly added a good number of legal entities over the years. It is not just a matter of legal entity reduction and that is the magic bullet. It is the sum of pieces and those pieces can include I would really look at it as a bit of the complexity overall relative to our acquisitions. So what you have is when you have a number of legal entities you can have a high number of buy/sell entities, you can potentially have duplication of stocks controls [indiscernible] and ERP systems. We look at the legal entity is a relative easy way to describe it and it is a bit of an umbrella to describe a set of simplification activities we think we can undertake. Like any good undertaking of an initiative like that we want to think about the cost benefit associated with that. So we have been relatively modest in terms of how fast we have been moving on it because we want to really prove out a good level of ROI as we reduce the legal entities. Now we're reducing legal entities every year.  We reduce bank accounts every year. In years where we have had more acquisitions sometimes that can get you right back to the water line. At this point where we have had a low number of acquisitions in recent -- the last couple of quarters now we're getting this is an opportunity for us to get a bit ahead of it. How much exactly that will play out over time and what kind of savings that can lead to over time I would say it remains to be determined at a real high level of specificity. But we definitely have a level of conviction that it is part of our plan to generate better operating leverage and ability for us to scale as an organization going forward. You had a third one, Brett.
Brett Wong: Sorry, I didn't mean to wrap so many questions in to one. I know that is difficult to deal with. But thanks for all that color, Rob. And I guess the last was out of all those initiatives what do you see as the lowest hanging fruit or the biggest opportunities in the near term?
Robert Painter: In terms of the -- are you talking about the initiatives that Steve referred to?
Brett Wong: Yes.
Steve Berglund: I would basically say the lowest hanging fruit would be just this pruning activity. Now it doesn't generate huge numbers, but it does actually move operating margin percentage and probably when we're done it will have moved it by a point rounding up maybe a bit. So I think that's the lowest hanging fruit. I think the more significant in the short term is just let's call it increase cost rigor just looking at cost categories and just putting them in the frame work of cost benefit and I think that we're doing it continually but let's just say within the last year we have become more intense about it. But I think that in terms of short term significance that is the most significant over the next couple of quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.
David Rose: Just a couple of points of clarification. On the Mobile Solutions business as the backlog builds how do you get comfortable that what's in the backlog doesn't have a similar effect? Or maybe better asked is what's in the backlog mix; heavy equipment, is it subscription? How should we think about it going forward as you grow the backlog each and every quarter as well.
Robert Painter: So to put it in context we have a record backlog in the business now. If we were to have in principle if we had another step function level of backlog come in it would be possible that we could have a shift out in the margin expansion but then that would be offset by a higher cumulative subscriber base generating margins on that basis. The model as we have planned it for the quarter and for the rest of the year takes in to account our current level of backlog and how that will play out, current and expected I should say level of backlog and how that will play out.
David Rose: Rob, I guess as you get more into the role that you have today, how are you getting more comfortable with the forecasting across so many different businesses and certainly in the case with Advanced Devices it was short fall and I think there were some other moving pieces across the cost structure. So maybe you can provide a little bit more clarity for us in terms of what you are doing to improve the forecasting.
Robert Painter: If you take a forecasting we break it down into a series of pieces maybe there is an some kind of X, some proverbial X and Y axis. At one level you have our reporting segments and the division underneath that and then on the other axis you could take the lines of the P&L. I would say the one -- if I take the line to the P&L and that axis we start with a high, high level of conviction there that we have to know our cost and that tone at the top is that predictability on our cost structure is job number one. The majority of our costs as an organization are people costs as a technology Company. The rigor around managing our cost structure across all the divisions of the company starts with let's say starts with tone at the top and is not a new tone as Steve said. Next I would say we work I guess I am working up the P&L from a gross margin perspective, really looking out and really it is about knowing your business. There is not one Trimble answer as you know with the portfolio and the number of different businesses we have. So mix can change the overall number and I can get comfortable with that at an overall Company level. To me the point would be at the individual division segment level that we really understand what the drivers of our margins are and we understand the profile of our margins as it relates to things like product mix or geographic mix. And then finally as you work up to the top line there you would naturally expect the most degree of variability on the P&L but you are still managing it within a relatively tight range the expectations that we set so that is really driving a lot of rigor around let's call it our planning processes and our communications with the team. That's on one axis. At the other level with division by division roll up there is probably an unique answer for most every in every business so we definitely don't have a one size fits all answer for the different business.
David Rose: Maybe I can follow up later on. I was just trying to get a better sense in terms of what you are doing differently to tighten the process a little bit more, but I can follow up afterward in interest of everyone's time. Maybe on a cash flow side if you can just walk us through lastly. It is a great number for the quarter. What is your expectations in terms of free cash flow conversion for the year and as you go to the subscription and services business how should we think about that inventory number?
Robert Painter: So we don't guide out on cash flow presently. I guess what I would tell you is the performance we saw in the quarter that is not a let's say not a fluke and we would expect that kind of progression and performance over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.
Eli Lustgarten: I want to step back because I listen to the entire description and I look at what consensus numbers look at and I have to get back to some very basics. Based on what you are saying wouldn't the probability of revenue in the second half of this year exceed the revenue in the first half of this year? Is that what you are implying? Because that is not what consensus is looking at, that is not what people, investors it is not what is in the statistics. But it almost has to be that you are expecting a much better revenue in the second half versus the first half of year, not versus last year. We know versus last year but the second half would be a stronger revenue than the first half which is a little bit seasonal.
Robert Painter: We don't have to imply it we will say it outright. We do expect the second half to be stronger than the first half and forth reasons we tried to list here.
Eli Lustgarten: What I'm seeing is the way the estimates there is a $1.25 consensus on [indiscernible] you missed the first quarter by$0.03, your guidance in second quarter is a little bit less. So you are sort of still believing we're going to get to where we ought to get to but based on a much stronger second half in the year; that is a fair statement I think at this point?
Robert Painter: Yes, again all we have actually talked about up to this point in time is the first quarter and the total year. And I think for some of the reasons we talked about the first quarter was in the midpoint of guidance and there was a scenario that said it would have been stronger but in terms of late breaking customer acceptances and whatever influenced the number down. I kind of shrug my shoulders at that and say okay, I don't think that is part of the secular story here. But I think all along given the profile of the year is that when we have been talking about the full year we believe there is underlying up to the right trend involved in this Company and it kind of plays out through 2015 and actually into the first quarter. It is not obvious but particularly when you adjust for things like the deferred revenue effects and all those sorts of things we believe there is a trend here. And if you look at the franchise businesses of heavy civil buildings, transportational logistics even ag excluding Geospatial we believe that the outlook for the year is good in some of the cases improving. So, yes, without a doubt without any ambiguity whatsoever management believes the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half.
Eli Lustgarten: Now can we just go through the Mobile Solutions business. You know truck markets you have gotten great OEM contracts and this is basically a penetration argument going on of a new product. because we're entering a 20% to 30% decline in heavy truck production over the rest of this year and this product is not going into Europe from what I understand which is where the market is strong. So this is really just a penetration of a new product that's driving the Mobile Solutions business growth [indiscernible].
Steve Berglund: I think the paradigm is larger than that, Eli. First of all, in terms of PACCAR there is an OEM component here. But let's just say we're relatively immune overall from kind of what is happening in terms of the new truck market. As Rob said earlier our fundamental market is the aftermarket. It is going to the operator of the fleet and selling functionality, selling value add. So I think we're not really totally aligned with the new truck market. Yes, it makes it easier when you are putting [indiscernible] on the factory. But in reality the market paradigm is larger than a single product. We're selling an enterprise solution to a large extent. We're selling a work flow solution. So a new product helps, new product gives us a lift. But in reality I think the paradigm we're actually out there selling is a larger paradigm and it really has to do with work flow and it has to do with enterprises level improvement and those sort of things. So, yes, product enters into it but it is more than just product.
Eli Lustgarten: So the big backlog and the step up there is OEM business directly, isn't it?
Robert Painter: No, it is aftermarket driven.
Steve Berglund: We just may not be able to announce who we're talking to.
Eli Lustgarten: Okay. So the bulk of that backlog is aftermarket as opposed to OEM?
Robert Painter: Correct.
Eli Lustgarten: Same thing, can you give us some idea what you think your potential in the ag market. You talked about bringing the horse power which is where the demand is growing. Can you talk about what the size of that market would be relative to the size of the normal [indiscernible] tractor market or [indiscernible] which is big dollar value. Do you sense that market could be some sort of reasonable percentage of the existing market in ag?
Robert Painter: The answer would be yes. It is a reasonable percentage of that. And to maybe get our heads around that not only would you look at a market where we have been for a long time such as North America, but now start to think about emerging markets where you need lower price points whether that is on lower horse power or higher horse power equipment that starts to open up a strategy at play we believe will open up doors that heretofore have been closed to us.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Oppenheimer.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Kristin in for Collin. I appreciate you guys squeezing me in. Just a quick one from me on the E&C I was hoping to dig in little bit on your margin improvement story there. You called it out as the heart of the improvement area. And I want to ask how much of that is related to product mix versus what you are doing internally.
Robert Painter: So from E&C and the gross margin progression. Okay. So there is E&C margin enhancement throughout the course of the year and then there is also E&C's impact on overall Trimble, so do I will stay within the segment of E&C and what is happening there. Okay. The first one which really one of the primary drivers of the margin expansion in E&C comes from the Trimble Building business and the Buildings business is90% plus the software business portfolio and with software like margins. So the growth and the growth in the buildings business has been over the last couple of years been at a double-digit level. We have expressed on this call we believe in the Q2 and into the rest of the year that we can again grow double-digit. So you do that math and play it out where that is the highest growing segment within E&C and you have a margin expansion capability out of that business. Our Heavy Civil business its gross margins expanded year-over-year. So we see that playing out -- I said gross margin there. All this plays out into operating margins. You have really as much -- you have the impact of the cost reduction that has taken place in E&C on top of -- sure we have new products that come out in that business every year and of course that continues to play out as well. I would also probably really focus on that software and service mix.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And that sort of speaks to my next question which is just in the shift in the channel. I mean you are bringing in these more high value products with the software and the software as the service mix. How is that offset or where is the opportunity there on the operating margin standpoint? I mean those are presumably higher touch sales
Robert Painter: So the buildings business is predominantly a direct sales model. We do have a channel called Building Point in that business but today it is predominantly a direct sale and for our professional services as well. It is not only direct but it is vastly direct sales business. And, yes, you are right the nature of some of the complex software that requires high domain knowledge and touch leads to or has led over course of time to a direct sales model.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Todd for closing remarks.
Jim Todd: Thanks, Britney. And thanks everyone for joining us on today's call. We'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-09 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Jim Todd - Director of Investor Relations Steve Berglund - Chief Executive Officer Rob Painter - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Paul Coster - JP Morgan Jonathan Ho - William Blair James Faucette - Morgan Stanley Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray
Operator: Good evening. My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Todd, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd: Good afternoon. I’m here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rob Painter, our CFO. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company’s Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release, which is available along with additional financial information on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Let me begin by introducing Rob, along with his early priorities. Rob has been with Trimble since 2006 and has held a number of both corporate and business unit roles. He began in business development which gave him an early broad view of the total company. During that time, he was heavily engaged in the work that led to our second joint venture with Caterpillar, VirtualSite Solutions. From there, he led the construction services business and then Intelligent Construction Tools, our smart tools joint venture with Hilti. Most recently, he led multiple businesses that constitute Trimble buildings. Before Trimble, he held a number of financial and consulting roles at other companies. Before that, he earned an MBA from Harvard Business School. He therefore comes into the CFO role with expert knowledge in roughly half the company represented by E&C and with a good grasp on the rest. Although there will be some learning required, he has the advantage of inheriting a deep and competent financial organization which will make the transition uneventful. The same can also be said on filling the opening that Rob’s transition leaves in the buildings group, which has been filled by reassigning individuals who have proven management track records. Rob’s short term priority list is consistent with the corporate priorities we have been discussing. First, he will lead the ongoing effort within the company to restore and extend our operating margins. This will involve both ongoing short term and long term cost rationalization, as well as ensuring consistency between our long term business and product portfolios and our financial model. Second, he will lead an intensified effort to develop Trimble’s long term secular growth story. Three months ago, we described the outlines of the scenario for 2016 which focused on the restoration of growth and improved operating margins. While acknowledging the potential dangers associated with the concerns that have grown in the last quarter around China and the general lack of strength of the worldwide economy, our belief on the 2016 scenario we described has grown stronger with more insight. The fourth quarter actually contained more of the news about baseline growth than is apparent. There are three discrete factors which influence the fourth quarter which will not be part of the year-to-year explanation during most of 2016 exchange rates, the oil price effects which will turn in the first quarter and the effects of a sale of temporarily owned dealerships to independent owners. Adjusting for these effects leaves us to regard the baseline growth to have been over 5% in the quarter. This provides reinforcement for our 2016 expectation of revenue growth in the single digits before acquisition and divestiture effects and assuming constant exchange rate. Organic agriculture revenue which has been down year-to-year for seven consecutive quarters was up slightly year-to-year in the fourth quarter even with unfavorable exchange rates. This differentiated us from the performance of the new equipment OEMs and tends to support our expectation that agricultural revenue will be closed flat for 2016 in spite of continuing pessimistic forecast for agricultural equipment sales. The somewhat disassociated performance is consistent with the historical pattern and is reinforced by signs that the technology upgrade aftermarket may be reviving expected new products and still widely demanded in some regions. The other elements of the Field Solutions segment also reflect a generally improved performance. Segment operating margins are still under pressure against historical standards because of the lower contribution from agriculture but reflect the normal seasonal patterns and did end up above 30% for the full year. In E&C, our BIM centric buildings business revenue was up strong double digits from the prior year in spite of negative foreign exchange effects. It is expected to continue at this approximate level of growth into 2016, thus continuing margin expansion. Heavy Civil was relatively flat year-over-year and up on a constant exchange rate basis. It continues to face headwinds from the regional economic effects of the oil price decline and lack of project funding in previously robust markets such as Australia, South Africa and Canada. We expect 2016 to be a somewhat muted growth year for Heavy Civil with some potential uplift from the recently passed U.S. highway bill. A major swing element in the E&C segment during 2015 was Geospatial. Although Geospatial has been a significant drag, we expect a reversal of the trend and a return to growth in the first quarter. Some of this is simply lapping the ugly first quarter last year and some represent the effects of reallocation of focus and resources away from the oil and the oil-producing regions and toward more productive industries and regions. We expect relatively robust single-digit growth from Geospatial in 2016 with an increase in contribution at the operating margin line. Overall, E&C segment operating margin performance is still below the pre-2015 historical standard but did reflect a small year-to-year improvement in the quarter despite the negative impacts of exchange rates, the short term effects of acquisitions and the Geospatial decline. We currently expect year-on-year improvement in E&C operating margins through 2016 as we climb back towards the historical standard. The Mobile Solutions segment fourth quarter’s growth rate diminished somewhat and will remain relatively low in the first quarter. However, we anticipate the segment will be the strongest performer within the company for the total of 2016. The fourth quarter was affected by the delay of transportation and logistics OEM deliverables from the fourth quarter into the first quarter as well as some rollout issues with our recently announced video and mobile gateway products. These effects will also impact the first quarter growth rate. Short term issues aside, the visible orders pipeline supports our expectation that the T&L 2016 growth rate will ramp up during the remainder of the year and demonstrate double-digit growth for the full year. A key negative issue within the Mobile Solutions segment continues to be the Field Services business in which the outlook is improving but where positive effects take time to play out because the business is sale-centered. All in, we currently expect to step up in growth for the full segment during 2016 and continued margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, we generated a non-GAAP operating margin of 16.3%, which is up year-to-year and is consistent with our efforts to return to the neighborhood of 20% during 2016. The gross margin compared favorable to last year’s and expenses were down year-to-year. Before the effect of acquisitions that were not in last year’s fourth quarter results, total quarterly expenses were down almost $13 million year-to-year and that dropped by 1.3 percentage points of revenue. Expenses associated with new acquisitions added almost $9 million [ph] of expenses and increased the percentage of our expenses-to-revenue to the as reported 40.6%. All of the expense reductions were in marketing, selling and G&A costs. As reported, R&D costs were 14.8% of revenue, which is higher than our historical run rate at 13% to 14%. While we anticipate working R&D spending down into our traditional range during 2016, we have a number of significant new product and technology programs underway and will run somewhat hotter in the early part of 2016. As we have discussed in previous quarters, we continue to work on a number of programs to improve our cost-effectiveness. The first is the reduction of the number of business lines. This portfolio adjustment will reduce 2016 revenue by approximately 1% which should improve the operating margin by the better part of a point. We are incrementally narrowing the strategic focus of the company to the core franchises of Construction, Geospatial, Agriculture and Transpiration and Logistics and a handful of emerging businesses that have significant three-year potential - rail, electrical and water utilities, forestry and field services. The second initiative is the consolidation and leaning out of the organizational infrastructure that has grown up through our acquisitions. One significant element of this will involve the elimination of unnecessary legal entities acquired through acquisition with their corresponding costs. A third initiative is to consolidate organizations and operations into more cost-effective configurations where possible. Some of this effort is already complete and some is ongoing. This has involved consolidating a number of selling and manufacturing organizations to gain better cost leverage. A fourth initiative is the ongoing consolidation of product platforms and the reduction of redundant R&D activity. This is particularly important because we have been an active acquirer of technology and have accumulated a range of diverse product platforms. This effort to achieve convergence has been underway for a few years and is now achieving critical mass. Another area of sharpened focus is on getting the balance of hardware and software development right. We are a solutions company and our value is created through a bundle of hardware, software and services for the user. We are re-sharpening our focus and ensuring that our hardware development is creating unique value and in some cases, we are outsourcing hardware elements to better focus on the solution, reduce development cost and improve time-to-market. The regional picture looks much like it did three months ago with perhaps more of an upside bias. The U.S. continues to provide growth opportunities that is not particularly robust. Brazil, Russia and South Africa, previously areas of significant growth potential, are in sharp decline. Canada and Australia continue to trend down. China is currently suffering from deferred decision-making as a result of both market volatility and government indecision but is still regarded as a source of growth over the next several years. Although Europe remains volatile, we saw growth as measured in local currency in 2015, continue to see strong growth in some national markets and generally see an upward bias in the region. We have made a number of small acquisitions over the last six months that extend growth platforms. The entire price tag for these six acquisitions is slightly more than $100 million. Five of the six are software businesses and the sixth provides a bundle of software and hardware. Spatial Dimension was acquired in August and extends our role beyond our existing geospatial product offerings in the land management market segment. It will operate within E&C. Vianova was announced in September and is a BIM provider focused on tools for civil engineering design and project management and infrastructure lifecycle management. It will operate within E&C. PocketMobile was acquired in October and is an enterprise mobility platform provider and offers a mobile front end that agnostically integrates with enterprise back ends. It will operate within Mobile Solutions. AGRI-TREND was acquired in November and is an important element in our Connected Farm strategy. It actualizes the concept of the trusted advisor to the farmer and provides us with access to a network of 110 experts who support the advisors to farmers. It will operate within Field Solutions. Telog was acquired in November and provides the water industry with wireless remote monitoring, analytics and data acquisition systems. It will operate within Field Solutions. Sefaira was acquired this month and it provides performance-based design for architecture and HVAC planning. It enables designers to understand performance implications of design choices in real-time and evaluate different design scenarios to better understand tradeoffs. It will operate within E&C. Beyond the ongoing initiatives focused on rationalization, there are a number of other strategic actions aimed at improving our market penetration. One of the most important is the general emphasis on mapping the right go-to-market strategy onto the individual markets. This is particularly important as we add more software and service content to the product mix. Our basic distribution backbone for Heavy Civil, Agriculture and Geospatial will continue to be a third party channel, augmented by a direct sales and professional services capability focused on large key accounts and major projects. For the buildings businesses, it will be mixed with a higher component of direct distribution. Transportation and Logistics will continue to have a direct sales emphasis as will most of the emerging market initiatives. Although a first inference would be that this will involve a doubling up on the cost side, we believe the implications on operating margins are net-net positive. For Heavy Civil SITECH channel is maturing and proving to be a needle mover for the industry in terms of bringing new technology to the market and a major competitive differentiator. In the buildings construction market, we are growing the BuildingPoint channel and emulating many of the characteristics that have proved successful for the SITECH channel. For Agriculture, we recently formally announced the new Vantage third party distribution channel which is similar to both the SITECH and BuildingPoint models built on the existing dealer channel but with an upgraded set of expectations for the dealers selected, particularly as it relates to software and support capabilities. In parallel, we have built out a meaningful account and project sales capability over the last 18 months to focus on specific opportunities or meeting enterprise level needs. Our success with the Beijing new airport is representative of what we are attempting to achieve. Before turning the call over to Rob, my summary consists of three points. First, we are operating in a continuing tough environment in which the markets are generally not giving us any favors. Second, we are emphasizing the fundamentals of controlling to our model, short term and long term. Third, we continue to hold strategically advantageous positions in markets that give us substantial headroom and substantial penetration possibilities. We are therefore balancing short term progression with long term strategic goals. Rob?
Rob Painter: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me first say that I’m excited to be Trimble’s new CFO. I remain as enthusiastic today about Trimble’s prospects as I was 10 years ago when I joined the company. I look forward to meeting many of you on the call today in the coming weeks and months. Before getting to the numbers, please note that unless otherwise indicated, the operating results I will discuss today will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is in our earnings press release, along with the financial data by segment. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. Now let’s turn to the fourth quarter full year results. Overall, our results came in ahead of our expectations. Q4 total revenue was $560 million, down 1% year-over-year. Currency translation subtracted approximately 3% year-over-year and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately 1% year-over-year. Turning to our revenue by segment, Engineering and Construction segment revenue of $319 million was down 3%. Currency translation subtracted approximately 4% and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures reduced revenue approximately 1% year-over-year. Within E&C, the revenue performance was mixed. Trimble Buildings grew double digits organically. Heavy Civil revenue was relatively flat, impacted negatively by FX and positively by acquisitions. Geospatial revenue was down double digits but improved from recent quarters and continues to be impacted by the combination of FX and continued weakness in regions with significant oil and gas exposure. We expect Geospatial to begin growing in the first quarter and grow through the rest of the year. In the Field Solutions segment, revenue of $79 million was down 2%. Currency translation subtracted approximately 3% and acquisitions had an approximate 2% positive impact. Within Field Solutions, despite negative FX effects, agriculture was up slightly, offset by GIS. Mobile Solutions segment revenue of $132 million was up 7%. Currency translation subtracted approximately 3% and acquisitions had an approximate 3% positive impact. Within the segment, the Transportation and Logistics business was up high single digits, somewhat lower than the recent performance due to product rollout delays and the impact of OEM-related revenue moving from the fourth quarter into 2016. These new products are now commercially available. The rest of the segment was up slightly year-over-year. Advanced Devices segment revenue of $29 million was down 5% due primarily to weaker OEM sales. As we have previously discussed, Advanced Devices revenue can be lumpy due to the timing of sales to a range of OEMs. By geography, our revenue split was as follows. 54% from North America, 25% from Europe, 14% from Asia Pacific and 7% from Rest of World. North America was flat year-over-year, an improvement from last quarter. Within North America, revenue in the U.S. was up with a double-digit decline in Canada. By segment, Field Solutions revenue was up single digits and Mobile Solutions grew as well. North America continued to experience oil and gas related weakness and the U.S. and Canada impacting E&C. We expect E&C to demonstrate growth in North America in 2016 as we lap the oil and gas related effects. Europe continues to be a positive story with revenue up 3% year-over-year. Excluding the currency translation effects, revenue was up in the low double digits. Geographic performance is characterized by relatively broad-based strength in the U.K., France and Nordic regions and included signs of renewed growth in countries like Italy and Spain. After the excluding the effect of FX and the divestiture, Germany was up single digits organically and showed improvement. We experience continued weakness in Russia. Asia Pacific revenue was down 4% year-over-year as reported. Currency translation subtracted approximately 2% year-over-year. China was flat in the quarter, Japan experience strong growth and Australia remained weak. Rest of World was down 8% year-over-year. Currency translation subtracted approximately 5%. Brazil was weak, offset by growth in the Middle East. Turning to the rest of the P&L, our gross margin, operating income and EPS for Q4 came in ahead of our expectations. With respect to gross margins, Q4 non-GAAP gross margins increased to 56.9% compared to 56.0% in the fourth quarter of 2014, largely due to favorable revenue mix shifts. With respect to operating income, Q4 non-GAAP operating income was $91.1 million or 16.3% of revenue as compared to 14.9% of revenue in the prior year. The total company operating income percentage was positively impacted by organic operating performance in the quarter. We saw improvements in the performance of acquisitions and placed greater than 12 months, offset by an impact from recent acquisitions. Operating expenses were down on a year-over-year basis, even after the impact of increased expenses from recent acquisitions. This reflects the impact of recent restructuring actions that have reduced organic headcount on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate was 24% against a non-GAAP tax rate of 5% in the prior year, which reflected a true-up for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. In 2015, we transitioned to a new methodology on the non-GAAP tax rate which eliminates large quarterly variations on the tax rate. Q4 ‘15 non-GAAP net income of $67.3 million was down 12% as compared to Q4 ‘14. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.27. Net income and EPS were down year-over-year but would have been up without the tax rate delta. Let me now provide a brief summary of the 2015 full year results. Total revenue was $2.3 billion, down 4% as reported, compared to 2014. Currency translation effects subtracted approximately 4% year-over-year and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately 2% year-over-year. Engineering and Construction revenue was $1.3 billion, down 5%. Currency translation subtracted approximately 5% and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately 2%. Field Solutions revenue was $355 million, down 16%. Currency translation subtracted approximately 4% and acquisitions added approximately 2%. Mobile Solutions revenue was $520 million, up 7%. Currency translation subtracted approximately 3% and acquisitions added 2%. Advanced Devices revenue was $132 million, down 5%. From a revenue mix standpoint, we are continuing to see an evolution toward software services and recurring revenues across the company. For 2015, the combination of software services and recurring revenue represents approximately 47% of total company revenue, up from approximately 40% in 2014. Recurring revenue, which is a subset of that, in 2015, represented approximately 26% of total company revenue, up from approximately 23% in 2014. By geography for the year, 55% of our revenue came from North America, 24% from Europe, 14% from Asia Pacific and 7% from Rest of World. Non-GAAP gross margins were 56.8% for the year, slightly down from 57.5% in 2014. Non-GAAP operating income was $390 million or 17% of revenue as compared to 20% of revenue in 2014. 2015 non-GAAP net income of $292 million translated to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.13. Our full year operating cash flow was $355 million. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased to $264 million, up 11% year-over-year. The increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects changes in revenue mix and current large contracts. Debt decreased by $27 million sequentially, ending at $730 million. Our leverage ratio, defined as gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA, ended at 1.7, well within our targeted range. In August of 2015, we announced a $400 million share repurchase authorization and said that we intended to spend at least $150 million of debt authorization before year end. We executed on that plan through a combination of open market purchases and the accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in September. The ASR came to a close in Q4 as planned and during 2015, we repurchased a total of 11.2 million shares of our common stock or $234 million. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. Our first priority is our long term investment in the business organically and through acquisition. With solid operating cash flows and the current acquisition pipeline, we expect to continue to be opportunistic relative to the stock buyback. Our current stock repurchase program has a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. I will now turn to our guidance for Q1 2016. We expect first quarter revenue to be between $565 million and $595 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.30. First quarter guidance assumes current FX rates and an approximately 1% negative impact to year-over-year revenue due to currency translation. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $40 million related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $3 million, the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of $15 million and approximately $3 million in anticipated restructuring charges. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assumes approximately $254 million shares outstanding and a 24% non-GAAP tax rate. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Paul Coster: Thanks very much for taking my question, and welcome to the call, Rob. A couple of quick questions. One is, Steve, you talked about I think rationalizing the portfolio. I understand what was in it but what is actually being shed and what are the implications of shedding those products or services?
Steve Berglund: Yes, so I think that I’m a little reluctant to kind of be fully explicit here just because some of this is underway and will be affecting individuals. But I think if you compared the list of businesses I named today versus the list from a year ago, you’re going to find some things that were there a year ago that are missing in today’s list, such as mining, oil and gas, environmental, public safety. So I would say is they are not large businesses. They were consuming mind share and they were consuming some level of resources. And I think the determination was that we simply could not get the sufficient scale to really have them be significant factors within the next two or three years. Many of them are attractive businesses but just not appropriate at this point in time. And then again, in terms of the financial impacts, will be relatively minor, talked in the script in terms of a kind of 1% of revenue sort of effect. But enough was being invested in them that we can probably beneficially impact operating margins on a run rate basis by about a point a year. So that would -
Paul Coster: Okay. And my follow-up question, as you talked a little bit about rebalancing your investments between hardware and software, I think I took it that it’s still a bundled offering. But nonetheless, I think in interpreted it to mean that more is going into software and some of the hardware development will be outsourced. Can you elaborate?
Steve Berglund: Yes, I think that is generally the right perspective to take. I think there are some elements of hardware that will be commoditized. I think there will be, particularly with some of the changes in regulation, kind of draw new players with significant scale into some elements of the hardware. So I think that it will have a tendency to commoditize some of - let’s call it more telematics oriented hardware and is simply not going to be attractive to be a hardware provider there. I think our core strength is seeing the big picture. And I think that we would see ourselves fundamentally as an integrator and that we should be appropriately selective in terms of which realms of hardware we should participate in, just making sure that we’re picking hardware niches where we can create a unique value proposition.
Paul Coster: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, it’s Bryan Jaffe [ph] on behalf of Jerry. Can you talk about what drove the strength in Field Solutions performance this quarter in light of the continued decline in underlying demand? The results were much better than we would have expected just looking at what some of the agriculture OEMs have been reporting.
Steve Berglund: Yes. So again, I think that what the fourth quarter and what we’re expecting in 2016, I think, is consistent with our multiple year theme which is, okay, we are exposed to but we are not simply victims of the OEM equipment cycle is that we are selling technology which provides cost benefits and improved yields. It provides benefits as opposed to simply providing capacity. So I think that there has always been what’s called a bifurcation between the equipment market and what we’re doing. Yes, so it’s always easier to sell a piece of technology onto new piece of equipment. So a strong equipment market is good news for us. But I think that the market for the last two years really has been so bad, it’s frozen a lot of decision making among farmers. Now, I don’t want to be too aggressive too early in terms of what I say. But I think in the fourth quarter, what we saw was, first of all, a revival or what may be a revival in the aftermarket for what’s called technology upgrades onto existing equipments. So again, we’re not totally dependent on new equipment sales. We can sell into the existing install base. There are still regions that are really quite lively at this point in time. Europe and parts of Asia being examples where the doom and gloom that’s happened in the North America isn’t quite as pervasive there. And then I would say is new products or new product categories coming into play kind of create new market opportunities for us. So again, I think that the fourth quarter provided some evidence, maybe not conclusive evidence but some evidence that what we’ve been saying about 2016 is founded on a fairly rationale argument.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And can you provide us with an update on how the Manhattan Software business is currently performing?
Steve Berglund: It is still a drag on the company. But fourth quarter 2015 was better than the fourth quarter 2014. So we are showing progression and we expect that during the course of 2016 that we will continue to show progression. So I think the fundamentals are still, from an operating standpoint, are still there. We’re still able to go out and attract new business. But what we’ve got here is a kind of an accounting challenge in terms of being able to move revenue from deferred revenue into revenues at being at the key. But Manhattan is still kind of consistent with the strategic intentions that we had at the time of the acquisition.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hey, guys. Let me echo my congratulations as well. I just wanted to start out, can you talk a little bit about the Heavy and highway funding bill and maybe what we can expect for that in terms of your business for 2016? And perhaps a little bit of color in terms of the timing that could impact the business as well.
Steve Berglund: Yes. So I think that, first of all, the highway bill I think for the industry provides a lot of certainty. It did not necessarily provide kind of new levels of spending, but it does provide certainty. And I think that we’re already seeing signs that contractors were engaged in highway constructor or supporting highway construction are more open to making longer term investments because they see the certainty of money flow as contrasted to prior to the passage. It was hand to mouth, month to month sort of thing and therefore, made it difficult to make long term commitments. So I think as the year goes on, what we’re going to find is that contractors beginning to gear up to take advantage of the more certain flow. And again, it’s a difficult business, it’s competitive. Margins are thin. Return on assets are difficult. And so the only way to really influence those in a big way is through technology. So I think that not visible on fourth quarter, certainly probably not going to be visible in the first quarter, maybe evens second quarter. But as we get into the latter part of 2016, we expect to see some lift in the U.S. spending in construction which will beneficially impact us. I want to be a little shy about identifying the actual impact quantitatively at this point in time until we see a little bit more.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just in terms of the macroenvironment, how comfortable are you in terms of making investments and does it feel like there’s much of a recessionary risk that’s sort of baked into your expectations?
Steve Berglund: I suppose the somewhat fastidious would be that we’ve been looking at recession for outside the U.S. for much of the last year or two and nothing has really changed all that much. So I think that Australia is really into probably its third year of what we would consider to be a recession. And Russia certainly is probably getting into its third year of what we would consider recession. So we’ve been dealing with difficult circumstances for some period of time. And I think the two new pieces of data really in the last three months are China, but our fundamental view on China really hasn’t changed which is there’s volatility and there’s a major difficulty in getting people to make decisions on projects at this point in time partly because they’re looking at the volatility in the financial markets and waiting to see what happens out of that. And then secondly, without getting to geopolitical here, the relative emphasis on kind of decision making in the Chinese governments, the emphasis on anti-corruption really I think has slowed down decision making in the government as well as the uncertainty of feeding into the government. So China at the moment is a difficult market. But whether it be six months or nine months or 12 months when this starts to pass and whether it is a 3%, 5% or 7% growth country, it is still a significant market for us. And I think represents in the kind of over the next three years, still a significant growth opportunity for us. Now, the other piece of news at least from our perspective is Europe which in our view is actually getting more hopeful as opposed to less hopeful in terms of individual countries like U.K. U.K. and France showed very strong growth for us. Germany with some transactional confusion in the middle but was actually quite good. But we’re starting to see signs of life in places like Italy and Spain which have really been dormant really since 2008. So I think Europe is a question mark, it’s under a lot of pressure. But I think the macros in Europe to us are looking actually better than they have for some period of time. Otherwise, I think the environment is largely unchanged for us and something that we’ve been baking into our estimates now for a number of quarters.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: Thanks very much. I just want to ask a couple of follow-up questions on the international. It seems like you mentioned that Australia and some of those markets have been trending now for quite a while. Brazil and Russia seem just little bit deteriorating quite quickly. Are these markets that’ similar to maybe what we’re seeing in ag that if things stabilize long enough that the ROI argument for your products and services can help them start to rebound? Or are those markets so deteriorated that we probably are going to help for meaningful economic improvement to come through before we can star to see any pickup in business in those markets. That’s my first question. My second question is you touched about operating margin expansion in 2016, have you or could you give us some targets for where you think you can to and under what conditions? Thanks.
Steve Berglund: Okay. Yes. So I think in terms of kind of the ROI argument around the world, I think actually I like that question because I think it does, it’s relevant for us, maybe not in the same way everywhere in the world. But for example, in Brazil, which right now seems to be kind of in free fall. But I was in Brazil a few months ago and I think there is implicit opportunity for a company like Trimble because if you look at what’s happening in construction, the first year contractors that the large and not large by a little bit, but larger by orders of magnitude have been pretty much shoved aside because of the corruption scandals. And there is a second tier of smaller, younger, more energetic contractors that are attempting to fill the space. And those set of players are very, very focused on technology. So I think there is an inherent opportunity there when things do get a little clearer, a little bit more stabilized albeit at a lower level. The other consideration is that with the shocks that producers and Brazil have received among others, what’s called the mega farms in Brazil, they have an absolutely urgent need to reduce their cost structure to really be transformative in terms of their cost. And they’re looking for technology to be the transforming element on their cost structure. So I think in the middle of this adversity in Brazil, there is a real opportunity for a company like Trimble. Australia which is already an awfully well-developed market has always been an early adapter of technology. I think the similarity up there might be a bit different which is I think there we got to be looking for signs of economic recovery really to see anything developed. And Russia, again, I think there is a geopolitical element there as well but I would turn that kind of in the same case as Brazil. If they’re going to stay competitive on the world stage and many ways, they’re going to have to adapt technology aggressively to keep the edge. So I think the scenario varies around the world, but in the midst of this adversity, there are opportunities for Trimble to operate in these countries effectively. Second one. Operating margin expansion. So I think really, we’ve been talking for a couple of quarters about operating margins which have been probably on a 12-month rolling basis, hovering somewhere around 17% or so, we do view ourselves fundamentally as a 20% or better non-GAAP operating margin company. And with the gross margins that we have up in the neighborhood of 56%, 57% structurally, we should be a 20% plus company. The impact of ag falling as a percentage of sale as well as agricultural operating margins falling kind of from the 40s to the 30s has taken a whack out of us here in the last 12 to 18 months. But I think that our objective for 2016 is to demonstrate as we go through the year that we are a 20-plus percent operating margin company and really provide evidence of that. So I mean the factors that enable us to do that are, yes, some straight up cost reduction we have taken and are continuing to take steps there. Some of it is this pruning of what’s called marginal product lines, marginal businesses that will have a little bit of domino effect but will have a disproportionate effect on operating margins. And then finally, it’s kind of a recovery of some of these businesses and I would point specifically at Manhattan Software which has the ability to kind of recover the better part of a point there. So I think that as these things roll out during 2016, we should provide the evidence that we’re a 20% operating margin company or having a neighborhood of a 20% operating margin company and enable a conversation in terms of how we move beyond that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Robert W. Baird: Yes, good afternoon Steve and welcome Robert. Quick question, maybe first on the T&L business, Steve. You had kind of noted the high single digit growth here in the fourth quarter and that that would continue into the first but then accelerate to double digit for the full year. You noted some product delays, is that at all associated with PACCAR? Or is there any PACCAR noise in there that maybe short-term is slowing that business down but then gains traction?
Steve Berglund: Yes. I referred to two considerations. One was OEM which could be read as code for PACCAR just as they move from fourth quarter out. So not very far out, but far enough out to kind of disrupt the fourth and first quarter. And then there were simply in terms of a couple of announced products that we announced in the fourth quarter, we didn’t get to rollout particularly advanced in the fourth quarter so those have fallen into 2016 and just kind of moved things out a couple of months. And so kind of both fourth quarter and first quarter affected by both those.
Robert W. Baird: Yes, okay. And then just on the ag business, again, we’re still kind of speaking to - you spoke to maybe a flat, flattish year for 2016 was still a good prospect. And I’m a little bit curious, the OEM side, the unit build number did deteriorate when you listened to the year or some of the other big players there. .and they’re probably talking about down 22% as much as 30% on the heavy side. And so my question is around, do you have more confidence in the aftermarket side of the business that it’s offering to offset the bigger OE declines? Is there anything tangible there that you could note?
Steve Berglund: Yes. I mean I think that just looking at the fourth quarters for example which we surprised ourselves to the upside in the fourth quarter. So they moved to the upside or beyond the upside of the guidance was in agriculture and that was largely an aftermarket phenomenon. So what we actually saw in the fourth quarter - and again, I don’t want to be too aggressive here in terms of the vocabulary I’m sing, but certainly we are seeing signs that sure look like there is a technology upgrade cycle in the aftermarket taking place. And that promotions that we ran which really have not been effective for a year and a half were effective in the fourth quarter and we’re expecting those to be effective in the first quarter as well. So I think the aftermarket is looking more lively than it has been. We’ve got singles from the OEMs in the first quarter but we’ve discounted those so we are being, let’s call it, sober relative to our expectations of what we can expect from the OEMs. But it’s really the aftermarket. It’s really the fact that some of these new product categories that we’ve already released that we anticipate releasing during the course of the year that are getting some traction. And then again, back to some geographies are very widely in agriculture are not being hit by it. They’re still on the upswing in spite of commodity prices. So those three things integrated made me to believe that we can put differentiated performance to the OEMS during 2016.
Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then aftermarket sales, do they slant towards some of the precision ag products versus machine guidance? I mean are you seeing some uptake in that channel that you established? The vantage?
Steve Berglund: Yes, yes. I mean I think it’s smaller number of growing at a reasonably strong rate so it’s not moving the needle for us as a company at this point in time. But I think that the answer would be yes, but I think guidance kind of there have been generations of guidance and so a farmer with an old tractor with old guidance on it, there is the ability to go out and basically sell an upgraded feature set and sell it on to a five year old tractor. It is possible to do that and that seems to be happening maybe at a higher extent that we’ve seen for some period of time.
Robert W. Baird: Very good. Thank you very much.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Riles [ph] from Webquest Security [ph]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. I just had a couple of questions if we can talk a little bit about the restructuring, the actions or the benefits that you saw in the fourth quarter if you can parse it out a little bit from the actions you’ve taken and then the incremental $3 million in restructuring or that we expect in 2016, is that incremental in terms of the benefits we should expect in 2017 or later 2016? And then the second question is the global vantage distribution network. If you can just help me understand a little bit better in terms of in comparison complements this high tech distribution network.
Steve Berglund: Yes. Let me do those in reverse order.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure.
Steve Berglund: And maybe Rob can pick up some of the load here on the restructuring. As far as vantage is concerned, it’s the idea here and we put out a press release fairy recently and talked in terms of kind of expectations of the number of those. And it was over 100 vantage dealers is what we’re targeting. And I think it’s very much the same theme as those that we’ve already played out particularly with these high techs is that third party channel is still a very effective channel for accessing the market is if a farmer or a contractor has a problem at 3 o’clock in the afternoon relative to PC equipment, there’s no alternative really to having a local dealer that will come out and replace or fix the problem there locally. So we still have a very strong orientation towards third party distribution for some of these markets. But the traditional distribution which has been hardware-centric has been challenged by new generations of software kind of the expectation of being able to integrate hardware and software. So in effect, it’s what we’re selecting out of a number of hundreds of dealers in agriculture at this point in time but selecting a subset of those that are willing to invest and kind of step up to being able to kind of provide the integrated kind of higher brain functions sorts of capabilities that kind of more consultative approach to the farmer requires in terms of kind of more information based. So that’s what we’re intending to do. I think that if you look at the marketplace, nobody has perfected or nobody has come close to perfecting the right distribution channel to accomplish that. And I think that we have the expectations that maybe we can lead the way in terms of kind of getting, for the relatively small medium size farmers, a third party channel. And then for the large corporate farmers that’s got a more direct sort of approach augmented by the five dealer channel. So that’s what we’re attempting to do. I don’t if I was necessarily on point to your question, but that was an attempt anyway.
Unidentified Analyst: No, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Rob Painter: Yes. With respect to the restructuring. So we had last year taken approximately $30 million of cost out of the company, $15 million we did in Q1 last and then additional $15 million in Q2 last year. So the Q4 performance against that was in line versus the restructuring that we had put in place in 2015. You also asked about the $3 million that we guided on for the quarter and that is not new incremental expense.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then as a follow-up, should we expect any additional in the back half of 2016?
Steve Berglund: Restructuring?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, that will drive incremental savings in 2017.
Steve Berglund: Yes, yes. So I mean I think that it’s always been part of the culture and I think given an ability to kind of naturally rely on revenue growth as much as we did, I think that there is a view that we will be perpetually restructuring. So some of these things are relatively long-term. So reducing the number of legal entities but dramatically lots of complications of doing that, that will be a multiyear effort. So I think the culture and the mentality is, yes, continue restructuring and not necessarily in big public press release mode, but basically continually working to leverage our cost base and get what must be organizational productivity improvements.
Unidentified Analyst: Will either one of you be able to provide as you go along as you did I think of the first half where you’re able to see upside in the number, provide some sort of guidance whether there’s upside or whether something is incremental as just opposed to part of the ongoing 200 basis point improvement?
Steve Berglund: I think basically what I would prefer to do is talk about revenue in relationship to cost. So if revenues go up, okay, costs are likely to go up. But to talk about the relationship as opposed to talking about them as two independent elements. So I think that our fundamental vocabulary I think will be around operating margins and that’s the forcing function more so than talking about kind of discrete cost reductions or cost movements, but I would like to keep the vocabulary centered around operating margins and kind of explain the variables associated with them.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Brett Wong: Great. Thanks for sitting me the last minute here guys. I just wanted to dig in the ag new products a little bit more. Steve, if you could just provide a little more color, detail around what products you’re seeing that are receiving good demand? And then the expectations of growth or contribution from the new ag acquisitions which you guys did in the fourth quarter.
Steve Berglund: Yes. So I think the - I don’t want to pre-announce any products that have not been announced. But kind of pointing at just one product and then one product category where we’re ultimately had kind of a business. But one product category where they were released during 2015 that are providing some additional sales momentum were kind of new displays, what the farmers are actually looking at in the cab with the tractor and, okay, information is central, information is king. They’re king or queen these days. And so I think the display is actually a central part of the tractor. And we came out with new displays that have attracted some new revenue. And I think that even though we’ve been talking about it, it’s still a relatively new category. The startup and the learning process have been a bit longer than we expected, but I will say a new product category that has the ability to add a step function of revenue. Maybe not a large step function in the beginning but a substantial step function in the longer term would be irrigation, the ability to control individual nozzle heads on an irrigation boom for example. And that has again turned out to be a slower development or longer development cycle in terms of testing one unit for a farmer that may need 30 systems. And so we may spend one season actually testing one or two systems on that farm with the expectation that we may get another 30 next season. And so I think that that things like that have the potential for moving the needle in their own right. Now, the AGRI-TREND acquisition we made in the fourth quarter is significant because we’ve been talking about the information-centric farm and the fact that farming will go through a transformation in the next 5 to 10 years that will be the use of information to make decisions on the farm. Some of it real time, for example, how much fertilizer should I drop on the next section of field based on a set of analytics. And part of it is, okay, what should I plant and what’s my strategy for maintaining the field while its growing? But ultimately the farmer where it’s kind of a bit category to extent for the first category, the farmer’s looking to an advisor of some sort and they take different forms around the country and around the world. And AGRI-TREND really gets us into that ecosystem and have a scale that we did not have before in terms of it’s the experts supporting those advisors is what they do. And so I think that again, financial results here in the next 12 months are not going to be huge from AGRI-TREND but it really positions us well to play a leading role in kind of this information transformation. So I would expect second and third year results from that to be potential needle mover for agriculture.
Brett Wong: Great. Thanks. And then maybe I can just say one last one in here. You’ve talked about this increased focused on software going forward which is consistent what you talked about in the past. And we’ve watched software service sales growing consistently. And I know that it’s not always easy or consistent to see that growing on a quarterly basis. But can you just talk to what is driving that consistent growth? Is it the BIM offering? Is it T&L, both or something else?
Steve Berglund: Yes. Actually, I think it’s in some ways at different levels of intensity across the company. It’s really impacting most of the businesses within the company. And I think that some of this is conscious thought on our part. Some of it is just the demands of the market pulling us along with it. So I think that particularly if we declare ourselves to be on a transformative sort of mission, transform construction, take out 25% to 30% of project cost in construction by transforming the way work is done on the construction site, a similar sort of ambition in agriculture and in reality a similar sort of vision in transportational logistics, maybe with a little bit more help from the regulatory environment and transportational logistics. But really, for example, in construction, they get 25% to 30% reductions and project cost, it’s more than just a series of point solutions. It’s really a holistic approach. And therefore what you need is the integrated software to pull it all together. So that is kind of what’s driving the overall things for the company.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Christine, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. James Todd, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd - Director-Investor Relations: Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Francois Delepine, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release, which is available along with additional financial information on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Good afternoon. The third quarter result was encouraging in that it reaffirmed our forecast methodology, conformed to traditional seasonal patterns and supported the scenario for 2016. Although the conditions that have affected us during 2015 will continue to constrain fourth quarter and first quarter results, we continue to anticipate 2016 to be an improved story. The particular points of emphasis for 2016 remain the restoration of growth and the strengthening of operating margins. The most significant effects on 2015 revenue growth have been agriculture, foreign exchange and the effects of oil prices on Geospatial. If we define 2015 baseline revenue as the roughly 70% of Trimble's revenue, that excludes agriculture and Geospatial, that baseline has grown approximately 4% year-to-date on a constant exchange rate basis, excluding acquisition effects. Incurring this baseline into 2016, we currently anticipate both foreign exchange and Geospatial as being part of the year-to-year dialogue after the first quarter as we lap the effects. Although conditions in agricultural will remain difficult in 2016, with continued double-digit declines in OEM sales, we still believe Trimble scenario is for flattish agricultural revenue for total 2016. In addition, the bad news/good news reality is that agriculture has declined to the point where there is a more limited ability to swing total company results. Another background consideration in the growth scenario is the continued shift of Trimble's revenue to a combination of software service within recurring revenue sources. These combined revenue streams have grown 11% year-to-date and represent over 45% of total year-to-date revenue. While it is too early to be specific about numbers for 2016, we believe that current conditions lead us to expect revenue growth in the single-digits before acquisition and divestiture effects. In the third quarter, we generated non-GAAP operating margins of 18.7%, which is up compared to levels seen in the prior three quarters and consistent with our plan to return to 20% levels during 2016. The gross margin compared favorably to last year's expense – as expenses were down year-to-year due to ongoing cost reductions. Although Field Solutions segment operating margins continued to reflect the pressure from declining revenue, E&C and Mobile Solutions segment margins demonstrated progression in the quarter. In early – earlier quarters, we announced cost cutting actions that will continue as needed to match spending with revenue as conditions change in our individual businesses. In addition to reacting to immediate circumstances, we are also continuing to take strategic actions to reduce structural costs and simplify the business. We have undertaken a wide range of actions and have discussed some of them in the past, but let me identify four of them. The first is the reduction of the number of business lines. The first phase of this action should be complete by the end of the year. This portfolio adjustment will reduce 2016 revenue by approximately 1%, but should improve the operating margin by the better part of a point. We are incrementally narrowing the strategic focus of the company to a concentration on the core franchises of construction, Geospatial, agriculture and transportation and logistics and a handful of emerging businesses that have significant three-year potential, rail, electrical and water utilities, forestry and field services. The second initiative is the consolidation and leaning out of the organizational infrastructure that has grown up through our acquisition strategy. One significant element of this will involve the elimination of unnecessary legal entities acquired through acquisition with their corresponding costs. Another is to consolidate sales, marketing and development organizations and initiatives until more cost effective configurations were possible. Some of this effort is already complete and some is ongoing. One example which illustrates the type of actions we are taking is the consolidation of the two separate sizable PeopleNet and TMW user meetings into one combined event for 2016 and beyond. In addition, PeopleNet and TMW have consolidated support functions to provide a more cost-effective common face to the market. Another example is the consolidation of the sales leadership for the Geospatial, Heavy Civil, and building construction businesses, which enables improved cost leverage. Our third initiative is the ongoing consolidation of production platforms and the reduction of redundant R&D activity. This was particularly important because we have been an active acquirer of technology and have accumulated a range of diverse product platforms. This effort anew to (0:06:23) achieve convergence has been underway for a few years and is now achieving meaningful critical mass and is accelerating. One example is TPaaS, Trimble Platform As a Service, which is a standards-based Web services architecture that will be the basis of all Trimble service offerings and will be used by software development organizations across the company. TPaaS provides users with a common user experience across all of Trimble's markets and applications, beginning with a common identity and login. Another example is the integration of our InSphere Software Solution into Trimble Connect. InSphere was originally developed as a software platform focused on enabling Geospatial applications to work together. With the successful rollout of Trimble Connect earlier this year and its acceptance as our primary solution for Project Team Collaboration Services, we can now roll InSphere into the mainstream solution and focus resources on creating user-focused functionality and not redundant platform-level tasks. Trimble Connect brings substantial leverage to our users. For example, many users want to share a view of 3D models across a variety of hardware and software applications. Using Connect, users can view their models online in a Web browser, in a desktop application or on a mobile device. Both Trimble and non-Trimble application developers can leverage this functionality with a very simple integration and provide users with a common experience. The software-centric emphasis on sharing code and product across the company also extends to hardware, where there are multiple examples of sharing product and technology platforms among different businesses targeted at different vertical markets. The move towards the use of common platforms has significant cost reduction potential, but is even more important – even more significant from a market perspective in improving the customer experience across all of Trimble's products and markets. Being able to reuse modules creates scale advantages in the form of time-to-market improvements, cost-effective solutions targeted at vertical markets and seamless commonality within the key accounts are major projects using multiple Trimble solutions. Another area of sharpened focus is on getting the balance of hardware and software development right. We are a solutions company and our value is creating a bundle of hardware, software and services to the user. The two clear trends over the last five years have been: first, that relatively more value is being created from software and system integration and comparatively less from hardware. And second, that some historical elements of hardware are becoming more commodity-like. We are re-sharpening our focus and ensuring that our hardware development is creating unique value, and in some cases, we are outsourcing hardware elements to better focus on the solution, reduce development costs and improved time-to-market. The brightest performance continues to be in Transportation and Logistics within the Mobile Solutions segment and building Construction within E&C. T&L demonstrated double-digit growth in the quarter and we expect this will continue through the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. The primary drag at the Mobile Solutions segment level continues to be in the Field Services business, where the outlook is improving, but where positive effects take time to play out because the business is SaaS (0:09:56) centered. We expect a relatively strong growth year in 2016 in the Mobile Solutions segment. Building construction quarterly revenue was also up double-digits year-to-year. Total E&C segment performance was held back primarily by the year-to-year decline in the Geospatial business, which is largely a function of the oil price shock. Our Heavy Civil Construction business is also being affected by these same conditions in oil-producing regions, but is also facing headwinds in the Asia-Pacific region, primarily Australia and China. For E&C, in 2016, we expect building construction to remain in double-digit growth territory, but the baseline expectations for both Heavy Civil and Geospatial in single-digit growth. Our agriculture revenue was pressured in the quarter because of general market conditions, though with a particular pain point being the performance of the OEMs, which continued to be volatile and difficult to forecast. We are carrying a level of conservatism into the fourth quarter guidance. We continue to see an ability to differentiate our performance from that of the OEMs as we move into 2016. Our base assumption is that OEM revenue will fall another 15% in 2016, but that other compensating factors such as new products in the guidance business, new service revenue and continued guidance penetration of regional markets outside North America bring us somewhere in the vicinity of flat for the total year. Finally, let me update you on senior management appointments. Late last quarter, Darryl Matthews joined Trimble to head a sector which includes agriculture. He joins us from Nufarm where he was President and General Manager of the NAFTA Region. He brings a combination of significant agriculture domain knowledge and a background of implementing strategies in large and complex markets. In addition, earlier this week, we announced the appointment of Sach Sankpal as a Sector Head with a focus on pulling together our efforts in intelligent transportation and asset sharing. We define both intelligent transportation and asset sharing not so much as new market categories, but more as significant enablers in our existing vertical markets. Sach joins us from Honeywell International, where he was President of Global Safety Products. Sach was actually with Trimble from 2001 to 2003 and was actively involved in the early formulation of our construction strategy. We believe the addition of Darryl and Sach are important augmentations of the management group. Our traditional and generally successful managerial emphasis has been on the combination of market domain knowledge and innovation. In a larger and more complex environment, we are placing increased discrete emphasis on a strategic execution. Both Darryl and Sach have a track record of execution and will extend the diversity of thought within the Trimble executive group to better enable us to manage to tangible outcomes. Let me turn the call over to Francois.
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Before getting to the numbers, please note that unless otherwise indicated, the operating results I will discuss will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is in our earnings press release, along with the financial database segments. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. So now let's cover the third quarter results. Q3 total revenue was $562 million, down 4% year-over-year, slightly over the top of our guidance range. Revenue was approximately flat on a constant currency basis. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately 1% year-over-year. Relative to Q2, we saw an improvement in year-over-year performance in all of our external segments, but areas of weakness remained, specifically related to agriculture and oil and gas. Now looking at our revenue by segment. Engineering and Construction segment revenue was down 5% as reported and approximately flat on a constant currency basis. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately 1% year-over-year. Within E&C, the revenue performance as reported was mixed. Building constructions grew double digits, with a mix of organic and acquisitions growth, despite negative FX impact and benefited from the completion of several large deals. Heavy Civil revenue was down low single digits due to FX. Geospatial revenue was down double digits, impacted primarily by FX, continued weakness in certain regions with significant oil and gas exposure. Field Solutions segment revenue was down 17% as reported and down approximately 14% on a constant currency basis due to weakness in the agriculture and the GIS businesses. Acquisitions had an approximate 3% positive impact. Mobile Solutions segment revenue was up 9% as reported and up 12% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions had an approximate 2% positive impact. Within the segment, the Transportation and Logistics business was up double digits, with continued strength in both the Mobile and Enterprise businesses. The rest of the segment was down year-over-year, primarily impacted by Field Services. Advanced Devices was down 6%, due primarily to weaker OEM sales to telecom carriers. As we've discussed previously, Advanced Devices revenue can be lumpy due to the timing of sales to a range of OEMs. From a regional standpoint, the picture outside of the U.S. remains largely unchanged and is challenging. Our revenue by geography in Q3 came in as follows: 56% was from North America, 24% from Europe, 13% from Asia Pacific and 7% from rest of the world. North America was down 3%. Within that, revenue in the U.S. was flat, with double-digit decline in Canada. The largest negative impact on North America continued to come from our U.S. agriculture business, as well as oil and gas-related weakness in the U.S. and Canada. Offsetting these, the United States saw pockets of strengths in E&C as well as Mobile Solutions. Europe remains generally uncertain, although it was a positive story for the quarter, showing flat revenue year-over-year as reported and up approximately 12% on a constant currency basis. Europe saw strength, particularly in agriculture and within our Transportation and Logistics business. The primary pockets of strengths were in the UK, Netherlands and Nordic regions. Germany was modestly improved from recent trends. Russia is still depressed. Asia Pacific revenue was down 5% year-over-year as reported and down approximately 2% on a constant currency basis. The Australia, New Zealand area is still depressed; China was down. China is both uncertain and reflecting that uncertainty through lower demand. Our China revenue was down mid-teens year-over-year in Q3. While the Chinese uncertainty is likely to be a negative factor of revenue for the next six months, looking beyond that, we'll still see significant opportunities and still regard China as a source of growth. Finally, we experienced growth in a number of other countries, including India, Korea and Japan. Rest of the world was down 16% year-over-year and down approximately 11% on a constant currency basis. Brazil continued to be the primary driver of this weakness, and this market is likely to remain very challenging for some time. Middle East was down in the quarter, but has shown growth on a year-to-date basis. From a revenue mix standpoint, and as Steve mentioned, we're continuing to see an evolution towards more software, services and recurring revenues across multiple segments. We believe this will, over time, lead to better productivity and improved margins. Now moving to the rest of the P&L. Our gross margin, operating income and EPS came in ahead of our expectations. Q3 non-GAAP gross margins, slightly decreased to 57.4%, compared to 57.8% in the third quarter of 2014. Gross margins were relatively steady in all of our segments. While there were negative gross margin impacts due to reduced volumes and the hardware mix in some businesses, we also saw positive benefits from software subscription mix that largely offset those. Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $104.9 million or 18.7% of revenue, as compared to 20.2% of revenue in the prior year. Total company operating income percentage was negatively impacted by lower revenue, as well as by acquisitions and foreign exchange. Offsetting this, operating expenses were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, even after the impact of increased expenses from acquisitions in the past year. The impact of currency translation benefited operating expenses year-over-year, as well as results from the restructuring and cost containment actions we've taken over the past two quarters, which are progressing as expected. The non-GAAP tax rate was 24%, which we currently expect for the remainder of the year. Q3 2015 non-GAAP net income of $77.8 million was down 11% as compared to Q3 2014. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.30, down 9% as compared to Q3 2014. Q3 2015 operating cash flow was $72.4 million, down 25% year-over-year. Operating cash flow for the first three quarters of 2015 was $276 million, down 11% as compared to the first three quarters of 2014. Operating cash flow for the year-to-date period remained strong relative to non-GAAP net income, due primarily to changing revenue mix and working capital performance. And we expect this general trend to continue. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the third quarter of 2015 with $124 million in cash, accounts receivable was $345 million, with days sales outstanding of 56 days, and ending inventory was $271 million. Deferred revenue increased to $275 million, up 19% year-over-year. The significant increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects changes in revenue mix and includes the impact of acquisitions. Debt decreased by $120 million, ending at $759 million. Our leverage ratio, gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA, ended at 1.8, within our targeted range. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares of Trimble common stock for a total of $155 million. We received 3.7 million of those shares through the accelerated share repurchase program announced in September and additional shares will be delivered in Q4 upon completion of the program. During 2015 so far, we have repurchased a total of $228 million of Trimble common stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our first priorities remain to fund the business both organically and through acquisition. Given solid operating cash flows and the current acquisition pipeline, we expect to continue to be opportunistic relative to the stock buyback. Our current stock repurchase program, after the completion of the ASR in Q4, will have a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. I will now turn to our guidance for Q4 2015. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be between $520 million and $550 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.26. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $40 million related to prior acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of about $3 million, the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of $14 million and approximately $3 million in anticipated restructuring charges. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assumes approximately 253 million shares outstanding and a 24% non-GAAP tax rate. This non-GAAP tax rate still assumes that the R&D tax credit will be reenacted for 2015, which is widely believed. Q4 revenue, excluding M&A impacts, has historically been in line with Q3 revenue levels. Our Q4 guidance indicates a decline, although better than expected Q3 results. Guidance assumes that organic growth for the company, outside of agriculture and Geospatial, remains consistent with normal seasonable patterns. It also reflects the persisting macro uncertainties in agriculture and oil and gas-impacted areas as well as continued caution relative to markets outside of the U.S. Revenue guidance also assumed an unfavorable currency translation impact of approximately 3%. We expect operating expense to be down year-over-year, reflecting primarily the impact of our restructuring actions. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Jonathan Ho. Just wanted to start out. You guys talked about 70% of the business, I guess everything excluding agriculture and Geospatial growing by about 4% organically this year despite, as we know, a very challenging environment. I just wanted to understand what some of the drivers were that allowed the business to grow and what your expectations are in a more normalized environment for what these non-Geospatial and agriculture segments should be growing on an annual basis?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So, I think that – I think what, in those business excluding Geospatial and agriculture and then compensating for exchange rates, I think I would generally say what we've seen in the first nine months of this year is kind of our baseline for projecting into 2016 in terms of regionally and otherwise. So, I would say is it – kind of that 4% number provides our foundation for starting to consider net changes into 2016. So, I think, again the relatively strong points in that were building construction and transportation and logistics, okay. Within E&C, we've got some headwinds on Heavy Civil, but by and large, I think that that – looking into 2016, we're not anticipating kind of any net change other than we expect kind of at the regional level and in terms of new products and such, probably more contribution from Heavy Civil during 2016, more contribution or less of a drag, more contribution from Field Services. And so, I think that that's why we're relatively comfortable talking about growth into 2016 and then just kind of doing the net change thing, looking to Geospatial to grow single-digits, but looking for Geospatial to grow at a reasonable rate in 2016, and again kind of flattish – flattish agriculture. So kind of that's the formulation looking into 2016, but taking the first nine months, not assuming a whole lot of change in circumstances, certainly no improvements in the economies outside of the U.S., and using that as the basis for projecting into 2016.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then as a follow-up, just wanted to understand in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, I mean this seems to be a pretty big step-down sequentially. But if I recall correctly, last year's fourth quarter agriculture already – seems fairly conservative expectations on a year-over-year basis. So where is the step-down going to take place in terms of the segments, and can you maybe help us with each of the growth rates that we could think about in terms of that fourth quarter expectation?
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Yeah, so just kind of following up on what Steve said for the fourth quarter, really the weakness that we have assumed is still reflected in agriculture and you're right. It was a weak quarter in Q4 last year. We expect a further drop in agriculture in Q4, and hopefully, that will do better than what we expect. But at this point, we're quite cautious in agriculture as well as oil and gas as well. And there is a fair amount of caution as well built into the Q4 guidance with regards to the non-U.S. markets and some of the uncertainty there. So in terms of the last, just kind of go back to what – what Steve was saying in terms of the rest of the business, assuming kind of continuation of the pattern for the first three quarters of the year.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: But talking to, particularly in light of recent – some recent announcements from some of the OEMs, maybe it was today. Okay. So, certainly projecting nothing, but weakness at least in the short term from the OEMs. So, I think that our estimate for agriculture, buried in the estimate is – I think what we've got in there is, shall we say, a highly bankable view of the world, which assumes relatively – I guess, the word of the day is bleak, bleak things from the OEM segment. So, I would say our range estimate for agriculture is kind of the low-end is built into the estimate. There are scenarios that lead to better. But right now, we have kind of, let's call it, a very conservative view of agriculture built into the fourth quarter and hoping to do better from it. But I think what's in – is an awfully conservative estimate.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Good afternoon.
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm wondering if you could talk about the timing of the leaning out of the organization structure, Steve, that you laid out. Some of it sounds like it will be sooner benefit than other pieces. Can you just calibrate us and the ultimate opportunity once you're through those efforts?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, let's call it, the more tactical cost adjustments in – after both the first quarter and second quarter. I would say substantially most of the work in those has been done. Some will occur in fourth quarter, just some natural legs built in. I think in terms of this use of the word leaning out, I think that some of this is to portray that over time that the process will continue. So, in terms of organizational realignments, some of those will take more than a year to implement. And so, I think that – there is no endpoint per se in terms of what we're doing. The $30 million that we talked about in the first quarter and second quarter, I think will – is substantially done, will be fully complete by year-end. But then in parallel, I think there are these more strategic elements that will continue through time. I don't want to get overly precise about how much of the magnitude they will be. But certainly would like to use the language of operating margin more so than anything else. So, I think we've – last quarter, we laid out a fairly precise path back to 20% during 2016. If you go back more than a year, you've heard about our – you would read about our aspirations to be more than 20%, implying numbers more like 23%. So, I think that in the longer term, we believe this company is capable of kind of producing margins, operating margins at that level. And so, I think this leaning out process is actually more strategic and kind of leading to an end objective more like that.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then Francois, the Engineering and Construction margins were really strong this quarter in a tough end market environment. Can you just bridge for us the year-over-year drivers of percent margin improvement, while top-line was down and then just touch on it? It does appear like your fourth quarter guidance assumes that margins step back down. Is that right and any additional color on the drivers there?
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Yeah, so, let me talk about E&C in particular. I mean, yeah we saw a mixture of factors in that E&C, but the building and construction segment, which is mostly software, was particularly strong. So I would attribute a lot of the E&C progress in Q3 to that. We're starting to see – modestly, we were starting to see positive impacts from Manhattan, which we've talked about and that's going to be more positive next year, but it's getting a little bit better on a year-over-year basis, so that's also helpful. In terms of the drop in Q4 compared to Q3, so now let's just kind of put Q3 into context that E&C and overall, we have pretty strong margins. If you look at historically, we do see operating margins decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4. It varies from year-to-year; there's some acquisition effects that you've got to factor out, et cetera. But overall, there's definitely a pattern of reduction. We tend to have low operating expense in Q3 as a result of the summer season, a lot of activities that pick up in Q4. So we've looked at that. We've looked at the gross margins, and essentially – we looked at the gross margins over the last four quarters and took that into consideration. We do expect a small sequential increase in OpEx from Q3 to Q4, but relative to seasonality factors, again, less of an increase primarily because we have the impact of our restructuring action. So, there's lots of different factors that went into that. We're very focused on delivering to the guidance or better, but that's kind of how we've built the guidance.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Spinola from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the business construction sub-segment. That sub-segment has sort of evolved over the last couple of years as you've made some acquisitions. And I was wondering if we could just step back and maybe talk about that sub-segment and maybe give us a sense of how – what's in there other than Tekla at this point? What are the growth drivers there? Is it low penetration? Is it sort of a cyclical bounce in commercial construction right now? And maybe just from a higher level, what part of that business is software as a percentage and what's the – how much of E&C is business and construction these days? Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Sure. Probably not going to be terribly helpful in terms of exact percentages at the segment level, but let me try to give you a sense. What we call building construction is actually an attempt to capture kind of a whole work process, from design through build through operate. So, at the front end of that would be SketchUp, which was acquired from Google a number of years ago, to capture the design or pre-design, for that matter, but more the architect, and taking that information that is developed during the design process into the build with the user being the contractor, whether it be the general contractor or the individual trade. So within that category, for example, you see we have a mechanical electrical plumbing-focused business. We have a business focus – business element focused on general contractors. In there, we have more – in between is Tekla, which is really focused on steel and concrete BIM design and then ultimately to enable us to take the data that has been built up during the construction process and deliver it into the operating model. We acquired Manhattan Software to be the repository for the operators of these buildings that have been constructed. So, I would say that the foundation view of how we view this market is really around information and software, and integrating kind of all these elements through a software platform. Now, I would say what makes Trimble unique in this category though is the combination of hardware and software and information. So for example, think of a plumbing contractor installing plumbing fixtures in a building, on a handheld or on a portable tool, drill or some other tool, actually referencing the BIM database, wireless length to the BIM database, and actually doing real-time positioning – where to position the drill bit ultimately, sort of thing. And that's where you see the relative uniqueness of Trimble is that we've got hardware element, we've got the software element, we can combine those into a common solution for the contractor. So I think again, probably don't want to quote specific percentage of software, but I would say in the building construction element within E&C, it is significantly software-oriented. That will continue to develop mostly along software, but there are hardware elements of value in there as well. And as far as E&C, let's say I would, in general, say – well, let's talk in terms of software intensity, so the Mobile Solutions is the most software-intensive part of Trimble, it's just kind of virtually all software. E&C would be next. Agriculture and the Field Solutions would be – will develop over the next few years and become much more information-centric. But I would say, E&C would be in the intermediate position, kind of among the three large segments at this point in time. But I don't think we want to get in the business kind of quoting specific percentages at this point.
Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Fair enough. And just one other for me, switching gears a little to ag. With all the commentary around ag, I think you'd made the comment previously that you – you thought 30% for the – that segment was going to be the base for the margin profile. And I'm just wondering is, I know this is weaker this quarter obviously on lower revenue, but can you help us understand what's driving that, at least in that quarter? Is there any issues around pricing and is 30% still a good baseline for the ag segment? Thanks.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So I think that – yeah, certainly margin has been under pressure just because of the scale effect. I would say the core of that segment is agriculture. I think we remain comfortable with 30% operating margins for agriculture, GIS and the other components in that – in that segment are maybe putting some pressure on the segment level. But I think overall for agriculture, kind of the core of the segment, we still kind of see 30% – our commitment is to 30%. But as far as pricing pressures, no real – no real pricing pressures, no new pricing pressures. Pricing really isn't the dynamic in that market at this point in time. So, pricing is pretty stable. So, I think it's mostly – margin management here is mostly kind of on the cost side, not necessarily on the pricing side, other than foreign exchange, of course.
Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Yes, thanks, Steve. My first question is on this organizational realignment that you detailed today. You do have this history of tuck-in acquisitions, quite a few. The argument is, these targets have access to more scale and more resources that Trimble has to offer. But given the challenging environment, do any of these acquisitions stand out, either more on the – a more disappointing side or more surprisingly positive side?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: I think it certainly is a range value of – on a continuum, I would say that we've been pretty public about talking about the challenges of Manhattan Software, which is a relatively sizeable acquisition on our scale, roughly a year ago, and kind of converting deferred revenue into recognized revenue has been the central challenge at Manhattan Software. So, I would say if I were to kind of construct a continuum here, Manhattan Software, I would not describe it as a disappointment. I would describe it as a challenge. And so, I think it's a strategically sound investment that will pay off, again, in terms of its design, build, operate spectrum. In terms of – at the other end of the continuum, just to create a range value here, I would point back a few years, I think PeopleNet and TMW have turned out to be a significant combination, acquired separately, but we're integrating the two. And I would point back to the PACCAR win that we talked about last quarter, as probably not having been possible without that particular combination. So, I think that would be a strong plus. Tekla has been a strong plus both in terms – from a financial standpoint and in terms of kind of strategic significance about positioning us in a central position in this kind of BIM-oriented world. SketchUp, acquired from Google has, I would say, not necessarily starting from the big number, but SketchUp has, I think, been a great success arguably with the potential of becoming a phenomenal success in terms of, again, giving us some platforms that we do not otherwise have, such as the three dimensional warehouse, content is working into the mix, in potentially across the company, SketchUp brings that in. SketchUp brought in kind of a strong three-dimensional platform that augmented Tekla's. And then I think that in terms of access, SketchUp has given us access to potentially every architect in the world, which I think we can leverage. So, I think this is playing out over time. And I think that one question that would have been very fair of us a year ago would have been, can you really pull these together into one user solution, one coherent user solution? And I think we answered that question relatively strongly earlier this year with the introduction of Trimble Connect, which does tie it all together, which unifies kind of all these product offerings into something that begins to be a comprehensive pool (0:44:55). And from a market standpoint, that has – is turning out to be very strong reaction there. So, I think again a range value, but I would describe Manhattan Software as a challenge at this point in time, but a number of these have really been strategically transformative.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Thanks for that. And then for my follow-up, what are the different scenarios in the near term for this federal highway bill to progress? It looks like the House completed the markup of their version. It looks like all political parties want to get some version passed, but there's a lot of uncertainty on how to fund it, how do you see the different scenarios play out and what it means to Trimble?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Well, I guess, I – for the moment, will more or less defer to the pundits on the issue. I think probably, the actions this morning in Washington were net-net positive to the probability of something happening. But I think that I – here is the case where I – as far as I can detect, everyone in Congress wants to pass a highway bill. And they are getting hung up primarily over how to fund it and that is looking reasonably etiological at the moment. And so, I'm not in a position to make – make the call in terms of what the probabilities are. But I would say – I would be more hopeful today than I was two days ago relative to the prospects, but I don't know how to put a weighting on it. And again, I think that if Congress did pass multi-year funding for the highway bill, it would have a relatively instant impact on Trimble because it would – it would change the investment climate for those contractors who are engaged in highway work. Right now, they are limping from quarter-to-quarter basically, not seeing a kind of a strong funding path. If they saw in a multi-year funding, there would be something to compete for. The way that they would compete would be through technology. I think our phones would start ringing within 24 hours or 48 hours of Congress passed the bill and the President signed it.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good afternoon. Steve, could you just kind of talk for a minute or two about the oil and gas exposure and your ability to track that exposure through your Geospatial business, and I guess to a lesser extent the Heavy Civil? But do you – first of all, is there – there's not really a direct number that you can track to the downturn in oil and gas, in terms of where those products go. But do you feel like you've got a good – your arms around, the secondary impact? And the fact that you commented about calendar 2016 being up kind of low single-digits in Geospatial and Heavy Civil, I mean, do you sense that secondary impact is bottoming here at year-end?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah, if you heard low-single-digit, I think I said single-digit. So, if you heard low, either I misspoke or you misheard. But I think single-digit and I'm not necessarily characterizing as low-single-digit at the moment, by the way. But, yeah, so there are two – I think, there are two numbers associated with oil price. And okay, we're seeing it in Geospatial primarily. One is a number we can identify with some relative certainty. And so, in the fourth quarter call last year, you heard us, I think, talking about 1% of revenue or $25 million, maybe $30 million. That is fairly directly tied with the oil industry, which is the use of our stuff in oil exploration. And so, during the fourth quarter last year, we saw that kind of evaporate in a remarkably short period of time. So, that was a primary effect. We had that one relatively well in hand going into the year, which was kind of $25 million, $30 million. That's gone for the time being. So, that will be a sustaining effect, that won't – it will recover maybe, but not particularly quickly. The effect that we had less of a handle on, which surprised us a bit was the secondary effect, which was the effect on regional economies, heavily centered in North America. So, places like North Dakota, Parts of Canada, Western Pennsylvania, Texas. It was the effects on the local economy and just kind of the chilling effect on regional investment in those areas. So, construction activity kind of ceased, the planning for projects ceased simply because the economic basis of those areas dissipated with the kind of the evaporation of the oil revenue. So, I would argue that we have a relatively good handle on that, it is very much regional. And so, we have – we have done a couple of things. We've redeployed resources, deemphasized in certain regions and putting emphasis on other regions. We have also, within those regions, with our – with our distribution partners, kind of refocused the business. They had maybe gotten a little complacent and a little too focused on oil as being their mainstay, they are refocusing. So, I think that – when we talk about or not – the lapping effect being effective here. I think we will see that really in the second quarter, partially in the first quarter, but in the second quarter pretty completely. And so, I think we reestablished a new baseline without kind of the oil effect. So, I think that it's not profound confidence, but we're pretty sure we can grow this business during 2016.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just as a – and as a follow up, as you laid out at the beginning of your comments, you laid out these four cost actions, and I know there's others, but you laid the four out. We also had the $30 million of cost take out that you talked about in the first quarter and second quarter. And then as we get into 2016, Manhattan will start to contribute more. But I'm curious, all of that said with the same general mid-single-digit core growth expectation. Are you kind of signaling a more intense focus on driving leverage, on a cost take out? Are we creating some cushion here to where we were just at the end of the second quarter from a cost perspective or am I reading too much into your comment?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: I would never use the word cushion, out loud anyway. But I think directionally, you're not far off here. So, I think last quarter, on kind of a no net revenue increase basis, talked in terms of how we get three margin points. So, that point is the 12 months rolling average on margin, operating margin, non-GAAP operating margin was, I think, 17.1%. And so, the focus on last quarter's call was, okay, how do we bridge three margin points back to 20% and do it in a fairly responsible, conservative fashion? Certainly, the 18.7% in the third quarter was encouraging in terms of, okay, it seems you're talking about a 1.3 point margin gap and it is three, but back to the three, the source of the three was called a point with some rounding, I mean just the portfolio effect, so there are some things going on in Trimble that we're in the process of cleaning up, but just shutting down non-strategically relevant businesses or selling them or, in some fashion, dispositioning them. But we figure there is a point there, rounding at least a point there. There is a point – from the $30 million we've quoted, $30 million is roughly a point of margin on revenue. And the other point, some of which should hopefully be relative no-brainer, is the Manhattan effect. As we structure ourselves to be able to recognize that deferred revenue within Manhattan, that turns into revenue, that will bring a contribution, where there is now just a loss for the Manhattan. So – and plus, I think there was an assumption that, okay, T&L, or the transportation and logistics business will continue. So, I think those three are kind of the key elements of getting back to 20%. Now if we – in terms of these other elements, I think we will continue to drive on cost and achieving leverage kind of in the categories, a low gross margin, R&D, marketing, selling and G&A. I think we've got a multi-year history of talking about getting additional leverage out of those categories. So, I think we will keep focused on getting additional leverage out of those. So, I think the – beyond kind of the path to 20%, again, we're looking for savings and opportunities and leverage beyond that as well. And hopefully, we will produce more evidence of that during 2016. Whether that represents a cushion or not, I guess we're just going to have to see.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just a real quick one for Francois. When you were walking through the E&C operating numbers, you had mentioned acquisitions added about 100 basis points to growth. But I just – kind of estimating the activity you've had over the last 12 months, I would have thought the contribution there was more like $25 million. So, is there a subtraction there or is this a deferred revenue issue or...?
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: It's actually a net number because we also had some divestitures of – and we also have the net impact of the arrangement with Caterpillar which reduced a little bit on a year-over-year basis as well. So, that's kind of a net number that you saw there.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay, thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here at the end. Just wondering, Steve, I know you've talked a bit about this already on the call. But as you look at the kind of mid-single-digit expectation for growth next year within the Heavy Civil and Geospatial, can you just talk to your conviction or why you expect that kind of growth given some of the other people in the industry, including your partner in that industry, are expecting kind of a flat to down year next year?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Okay, well, not sure which partner, but I'll pick two partners, Caterpillar and C&H. And one – so it starts from the premises that we're not an OEM. We sell – we sell ROI, we sell productivity, we sell yield incrementally. So, in effect just saying, okay, what the OEMs are doing is indicative, but not necessarily the total definition of what we do. And in particular, the two areas we're pointing at most strongly for sources of growth, T&L and building construction are basically OEM-independent, by and large. The PACCAR deal is nice, but we're largely OEM dependent in those two areas where we're expecting to grow. I think just kind of dissecting numbers, I think Cat has a major exposure to mining, and we don't. So, I think in terms of comparing Caterpillar to us, there needs to be – you need to do some conversions to get apples-to-apples. And I'd say the mining element is one major reconciling item. I'm not sure what they're saying about their engines business, but that would be another reconciling item. So, I think that the aggregate numbers may not necessarily be particularly comparable. But again, we're talking about single-digit growth in Heavy Civil; we're not talking about anything too aggressive. And that's, I think, a fairly conservative, fairly well thought out number that does not assume improvement in core markets like Australia or China. So, I think we've thought it through and I would argue the premises that the OEMs are necessarily substitutes for Trimble. Now on C&H, where we – which is our largest OEM presence. I think they're again, I think are talking about significant drops in demand. And again, we acknowledge that in our agriculture number for 2016, we are assuming a 15% drop in OEM-related sales. What we're saying is that okay, what we've got are new products that are pretty robust. We've got geographic expansion. So, the situation in North America or Brazil is not being – is not representative of what we're seeing in other places like Europe where we're actually seeing growth in agriculture. And then, I think there is the – we are adding new product categories in ag. So, the combination of those – we start with a minus 15% for OEM, and I think we have discrete ways to kind of build back towards, let's call it, a flattish number, whether it's plus 2% or minus 2% or some number like that. I think our point of view is that it's not minus 15%, it's not minus 20%, it's probably not even minus 10%, and that it all works together in there. And I think the other point is – this is a bad-news/good-news thing, is agriculture is now – you do the weighting – agriculture as a percentage of total Trimble doesn't have quite the same capability of moving the Trimble number around in terms of growth rates that it did a few years ago. So, I think we've thought this through. I think that we're not enthusiastic, we're not optimistic about the market. This is not classic Trimble growth that we're talking about next year, but I think we've thought it through, and I think we're putting out what we think is – this economic environment, this market environment that we're looking at, this is what I think we can produce next year.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay, great. And I know we're kind of up here against the time, so we can always follow up after if you guys want. Thanks.
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow. Your line is open.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Hi, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Actually, Caterpillar is very complimentary of you guys in talking about growth opportunities and getting business as opposed to (1:00:49) as a partner?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: We noticed that.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah. And that – can we talk – I mean, you've gone through a lot of material, market conditions, restructuring and stuff, can you talk about new products development spending and what's going on? In particular, you think about, with a lot of problem to the ag business, the competitive landscape has changed (1:01:15) and you are in the other one. And you have a lot of new products, you talk about a bunch of new products. Same thing is happening in Mobile – in Mobile Solutions, I guess you had deals with PACCAR. So, obviously, the whole host of suites in the E&C business. If you can talk about, with all the cutback that's going on, what's your new product spending is doing, development as we look at this year and next year? And are we really – is there a chance that we're looking at maybe some heavier investments next year as market begins to hopefully stabilize or further growth?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So I think the starting from Trimble at the 30,000 foot level is, I think the Trimble model with the composition business as we have in this company at this point in time, I think our general model is that, R&D spending is 13% to 14% of revenue is appropriate now. Okay. We've got to produce growth rates that are consistent with that number, obviously. But that would be our view at the moment, it's 13% to 14%. And so, I think we're taking the long view. We're taking the long pull on the ore and not kind of – we have thinned out R&D, but mostly with the idea of improving the relative leverage out of R&D. But the cost cutting we're talking about is not centered on R&D. And again, our view of the world is that Trimble value creation is innovation, plus our domain knowledge equals value to the user. So, we're not going to comprise on the innovation side. So, I think our product flow, the next 12 months, in the next three years, is healthy. I think the – as I talked about in the script is, I think the nature of it is changing, more software emphasis, more emphasis on system integration, less what's going on base hardware functionality, which is available from the outside. And – but I think that the – if you look at kind of new product introduction, I think we're doing fine. I would say is that you point out agriculture and I would say that in terms of the combination of hardware, relevant hardware to kind of the information problem on the front, as well as software development, I would argue that we're sitting in a pretty good place there and arguably the same for the mobile and E&C segments. So, I would – without getting terribly specific to say I think our – we're taking the long view, we're not compromising R&D spending and continual product innovation and an outflow of new products is really part of our basic culture.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Just a quick follow-up. I think during the presentation, you started talking about software subscription and the percent of the business and, I don't know whether I heard 45% or not. With software subscription, what percent of the sales and business is now and, if you looked out three years, what do you expect that to be for the company?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah, fair question and, but I don't have a, let's call it, an overly precise answer. I think it will tend to go up, but we're not targeting a number. I think we're really talking about what's necessary to kind of meet the needs of the user as the first priority. And so, I don't think we're targeting a number. Could I see that number being 20 points higher in a few years? Yeah, I could see that. But I don't think – we're not targeting a number, so I really don't have a number to share with you.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Where is it now, what percentage?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Well, what we said was the combination of software services and recurring is over 45%.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thank you very much guys.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: You bet.
Operator: We will now turn the call back to the presenters.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Okay. Thanks for attending, talk to you next quarter. Thanks.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Patsy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Second Quarter Earnings 2015 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Todd. Mr. Todd you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Francois Delepine, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release, which is available along with additional financial information on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Good afternoon. Second quarter results were in line with expectations. We continue to face the challenges that have been with us for the last several quarters, led by agriculture, which continues to be our most intractable problem and where we saw quarterly year-to-year revenue decline for the second year in a row. The stronger dollar and the effects of the oil price decline also impacted the growth profile for the quarter. These three effects impacted the revenue growth rate by an estimated 10% in the first half of the year, against the 6% reported revenue decline. We continue to expect these effects to diminish as significant factors in the year-to-year comparisons in the fourth quarter and first quarter. And allow us to credibly reintroduce growth into the Trimble story. We were pushed down into the middle of our second quarter revenue range by Brazil and China, which showed a sharp decline in performance, reflecting the uncertainties in both countries. In the first quarter, these two countries together produced revenue growth for us of over 10%, in the second quarter, they were down over 25%. Although, we were expecting headwinds from Brazil, in particular, we were not expecting something quite so precipitous. Although, European core revenue, excluding exchange rate and non-recurring effects, increased year-to-year in the quarter, Europe continues to be volatile and seems to be providing mixed messages. The brightest performance continues to be in transportation & logistics within the Mobile Solutions segment and building and construction within E&C. Although, year-to-year Mobile Solutions' growth was modest at the segment level, the transportation and logistics element demonstrated double-digit growth. Performance we will – we expect will continue through the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. The primary drag at the Mobile Solutions segment level continues to be in Field Services business, which is expected to deliver performance improvements leading into 2016. Building and construction revenue was also up double-digits year-to-year. E&C segment performance was held back primarily by the year-to-year decline in the Geospatial business, which has been hit hardest by the oil price shock. The demand for survey equipment was impacted directly by the disappearance of exploration work, which has been historically dependent on high-end GNSS solutions. The secondary effect, which is larger than anticipated, has been the decline in activity in oil producing regions. In effect, previously planned Walmarts are probably not being built in places like North Dakota. Our Heavy Civil Construction business is also being affected by these same conditions in oil producing regions, but is also facing headwinds in the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian market continues to be difficult and China became more challenging in the quarter. Our agriculture revenue was pressured in the quarter, particularly because of continued performance issues among the OEMs. Although, this OEM performance shortfall caused us to add more conservatism to the third quarter estimate, we continue to model more stability late in the year and continue to see flat to potentially up slightly year-to-year revenues, starting in the fourth quarter. The volatility in the Ag market remains unprecedented and this outlook represents our best effort view of it. Given that we are getting little help from the markets, our emphasis revolves around a few priorities. Secure the model, revive growth and tell the story. Securing the model is focused on a return to 20% non-GAAP operating margin in 2016. In the trailing 12-months through June, our non-GAAP operating margin was 17.1%, down from the 20% levels we produced in 2013 and 2014. The margin fall reflects the revenues in agriculture and Geospatial dropping faster than we could cut cost, the discrete impact of the Manhattan Software acquisition, as well as a few other portfolio effects. To recover to 20% operating margin, we need an additional three points off that baseline. The path to these incremental margin points under conservative revenue assumptions includes a number of elements. First, an improvement in building construction margins, some of it from a continuation of current revenue growth into 2016 and some of it, a significant bump from the ability to recognize deferred revenue in Manhattan Software. Second is a continued expansion of the transportation and logistics business, fueled by new products and the PACCAR business. Third is pruning the portfolio of strategically insignificant businesses and product lines that are generating losses. Fourth is additional cost control. Last quarter, we described actions to reduce costs by $15 million. After evaluating the environment, we will target another increment of $15 million of cost for an annualized total of approximately $30 million. The reductions are being focused on those businesses that are struggling with revenue and margins. Those businesses that are growing and delivering improved margins will be allowed to grow their cost base. We believe these actions will move us back into the neighborhood of a 20% operating margin in 2016 without relying on revenue growth outside of the transportation and logistics and building and construction. If we deliver a more optimistic revenue scenario, there would be the potential for upside. The second priority is to revive growth in 2016 after a difficult year in 2015. The issues that affected us in 2015 have created a long list with few positive offsets, agriculture, exchange rates, oil prices, European ambiguity, Australia, Russia, and now China and Brazil. If these elements stabilize at the current lower level and become the new normal, we believe we can grow in 2016. From a business portfolio perspective, agriculture and Geospatial have been the biggest drags in 2015. We believe the first half represented the low point of our Geospatial market performance, and that a level of recovery has already started. We exceeded our expectation in the second quarter, which is creating some restored confidence. The short-term role for Geospatial in the portfolio will be a recovery during the second half of 2015 with a return to meaningful growth early in 2016. Agriculture remains a hard forecasting problem. While the three-year secular growth outlook remains as strong as ever, the short-term remains volatile. On a relative basis, we appear to be outperforming other participants in the market. Our minimal expectation for Ag for 2016 is flat year-over-year revenue, which should allow us to begin to demonstrate the impact of the new emerging product categories and to avoid being a drag on the rest of Trimble. Our third priority is telling our story more effectively to both our customers and to the financial community. Current market issues are masking positive trends that signal the continuing evolution of Trimble. One of the most significant trends is the increasing role of software and services in the mix of revenue. A snapshot of second quarter revenue reflects that trend. In-spite of overall revenue being down, software and services revenues continue to grow strongly and reflect a three-year annual compound growth rate of approximately 20% since 2012. These dynamics are driving a structural shift of revenue towards software and services, and ultimately towards a more SaaS centric model. In-spite of the growing software and services role, hardware and sensors remain strong Trimble differentiators and are an important part of the value bundle for us. However, as a matter of strategy, hardware and sensors are becoming more of an enabler as opposed to the key value driver. Last quarter, we provided three examples of the lift that hardware enabled software provides. This unique combination of sensors and software creates significant upside possibilities for Trimble and we need to step up in our articulation of that story. Another perspective on telling the story is the development of the distribution channel to get this Trimble message to the marketplace. In prior quarters, we have discussed the challenges and the unique Trimble advantages in our go-to-market strategy. We have implemented a unique dealer channel strategy in the heavy civil market with the SITECH dealer channel and are building a new dealer channel for building and construction and building point. We're also developing an agricultural dealer channel based on our current dealers, called Vantage that will have the first wave of implementations completed by December. These dealers will have the capabilities to bring the information based Connected Farm to growers and their advisors. In both construction and agriculture, the dealer channel needs augmentation to secure major enterprise accounts or large projects such as the New Beijing Airport we discussed last quarter. Our new organizational format has created an intensified focus on securing large wins and we have doubled on the way to tripling the number of individuals who have both deep domain knowledge and large account experience to spearhead the effort. Most of these individuals have been re-tasked and do not represent an incremental cost. We expect this hybrid effort, combining the elements of both direct selling to establish and frame the relationship and dealers to provide local hands-on capability will turn out to be the right mix. We've continue to expect to produce an improving trend in the second of 2015, although at a slower pace than we originally expected as a result of the continued issues with the agriculture OEMs, Brazil and China. Our view on the growth possibilities of 2016 remain largely unchanged from last quarter. Regardless of what the revenue picture for 2016 ends up being, we are committed to engineering and return to the traditional Trimble financial model. Let me turn the call over to Francois.
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Before getting to the numbers, please note that unless otherwise indicated, the operating results I will discuss will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is in our earnings press release, along with the financial data of these segments. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. So, now, let's first cover the second quarter results. Q2 total revenue was $586 million, down 9% year-over-year at the midpoint of our guidance. Currency translation added approximate 4% year-over-year unfavorable effect, offset by acquisition growth of approximately 3%. The combination of divestitures and the completion of our contractual arrangements also reduced revenue by approximately 2% year-over-year. Additionally, Q2 2014 benefited from a positive revenue recognition event, creating a negative year-over-year growth impact of approximately 2%. Netting out those factors, revenue was down mid single-digits. As expected, growth was challenged due to continued headwinds associated with the agriculture market and the Field Solutions, continued weakness related to oil and gas in Engineering and Construction, and the down quarter in our Advanced Devices segments. Now, looking at our revenue by segments. Engineering and Construction segment revenue was down 8%. Q2 2015 E&C revenue was a complicated story. Currency translation had an approximately 5% unfavorable revenue effect year-over-year, roughly offset by growth from acquisitions. Divestitures of several distributors combined with the completion of a contractual arrangement related to the initial phase of VSS JV, reduced E&C revenue by approximately 3%. In addition, Q2 2014 benefited from a positive revenue recognition events, regarding a distributor, creating an unfavorable year-over-year impact to E&C revenue of approximately 4%. Excluding these impacts, E&C was down low single digits. Within E&C, the revenue performance was mixed. Building and constructions grew double-digits with a mix of organic and acquisition growth. Geospatial was down double-digits, impacted primarily by FX, continued weakness in certain regions with significant oil and gas exposure, and the prior year recognition events. Heavy Civil was down high single-digits, impacted primarily by FX, the prior revenue recognition events and a JV contractual completion. Outside of these items, Heavy Civil revenue was up single-digits. Field Solutions segment revenue was down 24% due to weakness in the agriculture and the GIS businesses, and the negative impact of currency translation, which was approximately 4%. Acquisition added 2% positive impact. The weakness in our agriculture business was slightly worse than expected, and was most pronounced in OEM factory install. Mobile Solutions segment revenue was up 4%. Within that segment, the transportation and logistics business was up double-digits with continued strength in both the mobile and enterprise businesses. The rest of the segment was negatively impacted by Field Services, which was down double-digits, and to a lesser extent, the Q4 2014 divestitures of a non-strategic business. Advanced Devices was down in the mid-teens. As we've discussed previously, Advanced Devices revenue can be lumpy due to the timing of OEM sales. Now, looking at our revenue by geography. 57% was from North America, 23% from Europe, 13% from Asia-Pacific, and 7% from rest of the world. North America was down 3%. The largest impact to North America was agriculture and Geospatial weakness. Europe was a positive story in the quarter. Although, revenue was down 13% on an as-reported basis, Europe revenue was flat excluding currency, and we have been up 9% excluding the distributor revenue recognition event from Q2 2014. Russia continued to be down. Asia-Pacific was down 18% year-over-year, a significant shift from what we saw in Q1 2015 where Asia was flat year-over-year. Currency only had a small negative effect. In the shift from Q1, China was down approximately 25% year-over-year. Australia continued to be weak. India and other countries in Asia continued with strong growth, up by relatively low numbers. Rest of the world was down 16% year-over-year. In another shift from last quarter, South America was impacted by year-over-year decline in Brazil for both E&C and agriculture. The Middle East and Africa were relatively flat. The impact of currency on rest of the world was minor. We're continuing to see a gradual evolution in our revenue mix. For the first half of 2015, recurring revenue represents roughly 25% of total company revenue. Recurring revenue as we define it includes subscription, SaaS, maintenance and support revenue. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L. Our gross margin, operating income, tax rate and EPS also came in generally in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margins decreased to 56.1% compared to 58.5% in second quarter 2014. Gross margins were impacted primarily by a combination of lower sales of high margin products in our Geospatial division. The completion of the VSS JV contractual arrangement within E&C and a one-time product cost benefit from a favorable telecommunications tax ruling in Q2 2014 within Mobile Solutions. In addition, both FX and acquisitions had a negative impact on company gross margins. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $97.1 million, or 16.6% of revenue, as compared to 23.2% of revenue in the prior year. Total company operating income percentage was negatively impacted by lower revenue and lower gross margin as I just mentioned. The restructuring actions we talked about at the end of Q1 have taken place, but I have not yet add their full effect on operating expense across the company. Acquisitions also continue to be diluted to company margins within the quarter. The impact of currency translation and company operating margins were small, given our globally distributed cost base. The non-GAAP tax rate was 24%, which we currently expect to see for the remainder of the year. Q2 2015 net income of $74 million was down 39% as compared to Q2 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $0.28, down 38% as compared to Q2 2014. Q2 2015 operating cash flow was $97 million, down 26% year-over-year. Operating cash flow for the first two quarters of 2015 was $204 million, down 5% as compared to the first two quarters of 2014. Operating cash flows have continued to improve relative to non-GAAP net income due to combination of deferred revenue increases and working capital performance. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter of 2015 with $129 million in cash, accounts receivable was $356 million with days sales outstanding of 55 days, and ending inventory was $281 million. Deferred revenue increased to $287 million, up 22% year-over-year. The significant increase in deferred revenue, primarily reflects changes in revenue mix and includes the impact of acquisitions. Debt increased – debt decreased by $24 million, ending at $640 million. Our leverage ratio, which is a gross debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA, remained at the comfortable level at 1.5 times. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of Trimble common stock for a total of $60 million. We have repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares for $171 million over the trailing 12-months. From a capital allocation standpoint, our first priorities remain to fund the business both internally and through acquisitions. Given solid operating cash flows and a modest acquisition pipeline, we expect to be active with share repurchases in Q3. Our stock repurchase program has remaining authorization of $177 million. I will now turn to our guidance for Q3 2015. We expect third quarter revenue to be between $535 million and $560 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.26. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $41 million, related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $3 million, the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of $13 million and approximately $4 million in anticipated restructuring charges. Third quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assumes approximately 261 million shares outstanding, and a 24% non-GAAP tax rate. This non-GAAP tax rate still assumes that the R&D tax credit will be reenacted for 2015. Our Q3 revenue guidance assumes continued weakness in agriculture and oil and gas impacted markets. It also reflects the weakened environment in China and continued weakness in Brazil, Russia and Australia. Guidance also assumes an unfavorable currency translation impact of approximately 4%. As Steve discussed, we continue to take cost action to shore up our operating margins as we exit this year and into 2016. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to start out with maybe little bit more color in terms of the guidance that you gave, particularly getting back to the corporate margins for 2016. I know you've sort of outlaid some of the assumptions that you had around that. But can you maybe give us a little bit more in terms of what your executions are in terms of the macro environment and perhaps, maybe the FX exchange environment as well and your thoughts on what that needs to be, in order to achieve either a return back to growth or a return back to the corporate margins?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So, I think we're kind of looking at the two issues a little bit independently. I think the return to 20% we're basically aside from some kind of continued growth in the building construction space or at least elements of it, which looks pretty good at this point in time, as well as the transportation and logistics, which again is looking pretty good. We're basically, modeling kind of a return to 20% operating with no real help elsewhere from revenue. And so, as far as exchange rate environment, we're maybe naively with the Fed potentially raising rates, but we're assuming kind of current exchange rates continue through into 2016. So, we're not assuming the wisdom of actually being able to call future exchange rate move. So, basically a flat line. And in a simple sense is, again through June trailing 12-month, operating margin, non-GAAP operating margin was 17.1%. So, in shorthand form, we see the three points coming from, one, Manhattan Software, which has been holding up a lot of revenue in deferred revenue. So, that – turning that situation around and being able to get the deferred revenue out of that, which should be possible into 2016. That's more or less a point of margin itself. The cost reductions we've taken adds another point, so that's two out of the three points of margin uptick. And the third point is a combination of some portfolio trimming which turns around some losses on individual product categories, as well as some lift from the building construction kind of organic realm and transportation and logistics. So we see getting back to 20%, somewhat independently of let's call it a larger revenue story. Now, okay, the revenue – in terms of revenue growth, again starting in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, we start to lap some of these effects, whether it'd be oil prices, exchange rates and the like – and okay, so essentially those no longer get to be the drag. So I think we inherently have growth built-in, it then becomes a question as to how large the growth rate we can actually achieve in 2016. But if everything more or less holds at the current level kind of reduced level, at current level we do see the ability to create a level of growth in 2016. We're becoming a little less explicit in terms of how much growth that could be given kind of these new headwinds from China and Brazil, but I think the construction of the scenario is relatively straight forward. The big element here is agriculture, which we are – which we're modeling and which we believe will be kind of flat line to maybe slightly up in 2016 and that begins in the fourth quarter of 2015, that's our view of it at this point in time. So, I think the 20% we have a path that doesn't assume a whole lot of lift on the revenue front, and then I think the revenue story is on top of that.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. That's fantastic detail. Could you just maybe delve into the Manhattan Software acquisition a little bit more and perhaps maybe walk us through magnitude of the deferred that you think is going to come back and sort of approximate timing for those chunks of revenue, the re-signed maintenance to come back?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So maybe let me give the kind of the business context and then give it to Francois to kind of talk to the numbers. But the business contracts, which we still stand behind, obviously we were surprised by and that the state of deferred revenue and the fact that we've been unable to recognize the level of revenue that we expected originally out of Manhattan. But again Manhattan Software was an acquisition toward in the second half of last year, really to extend our view of the connected construction site into the operation of the building, turning the constructible model over at the end of the project to actually become the basis of an operational model. And the fundamentals of Manhattan in terms of orders, bookings, actually cash flow has been consistent with our expectations, it's been a positive story, it's been the accounting that has been the challenge for us. So, from a business perspective, I think it's still valid, still fundamentally a positive to-date story on Manhattan. But let me give it to Francois to talk to the kind of the number side of it.
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So just to add a little bit of color maybe without giving the exact specifics, that we increased – out of the 20% growth in deferred revenue from – on a year-over-year basis. 16% of that, 22% was from acquisitions in that include kind of the acquisition operating balance and most of that would be from Manhattan, and if you look at the Q2 increase, so sequential increase, again, we had an increase also in Manhattan from the acquisition, we had an increase of mid single-digits and most of that again was Manhattan. So, and if you think of what's currently on the Manhattan deferred revenue balance, it's approximately $20 million. That continues to grow as we speak and has the delivery capabilities improved and we can turn the bookings into recognized revenue faster and also deliver some of the backlog of bookings that is currently in deferred as we deliver the product and implement the product that balance should stabilize or no longer grow quarter-over-quarter. So, that would start benefiting our P&L.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry?
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Good afternoon.
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm wondering if you could just flash out a little bit more color what you spoke about in your opening remarks to even terms of how the path to the build out of the buildings channel and how we should think about SG&A negative sales as you continue down that path looks like for the company as a whole-ish, your negative sales was up a few hundred basis points year-to-date. I am assuming big part of that is around supporting that channel. But I'm wondering if you just flush that out that and how we should think about that evolving?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So I think that starting to kind of looking back and moving to the front here maybe a little bit, but the – we're not looking to the changes we're making in channel to – we're not looking for any fundamental structural changes in our cost structure out of this. Now Trimble has become a little bit more complicated or maybe significantly more complicated over the last few years and kind of ratios like sales and marketing cost to revenue because very roughly 50% of our overall go-to-market approach has been – it has become direct, five years ago it's much more indirect. And that in terms of the way the accounting is done for revenue and where the costs are that will mess with the ratios a bit. So – but fundamentally, what we're doing now in terms of initiatives across the board, we're not actually looking to kind of move the needle at all relative to kind of the, the traditional ratio. So we would expect those to kind of self-correct over time. But specifically, on the building construction, kind of go-to-market approach on the channel, really two elements of that. One, we are kind of analogous to what we did with SITECH and the Heavy Civil. We are building out a main channel called BuildingPoint, which is a worldwide dealer network, commonly branded with the name BuildingPoint, with a set of guidelines and with a set of branding characteristics of that. Our attempt there is to make that channel synonymous with technology and vertical construction. The construction of buildings, software centric, but able to handle both – handle the bundle of hardware and software, and that effort has been going on now for, I believe over a year, is proceeding and okay, we expect within the next year to more or less have the channel substantially build out. Now, in parallel to that, there is the issue of large projects and large accounts, maybe the most significant account that we have been able to press release in this arena has been AECOM, which was last year, but in account like that isn't necessarily going to rely on a dealer – a set of multiple dealer relationships, there does need to be a kind of a central point of them because those are coming from Trimble. So, in parallel to the dealer channel, we're building out a direct selling capability in combination with professional services. So, Gehry Technology brought with it, a professional services capabilities. So, we are able to go in as a Trimble and do a corporate level sale to someone like AECOM or maybe more to the point be able to go in and in a project level make a sale at the project. Although, what's been announced so far with the Beijing airport has been heavy on the Heavy Civil. We would expect the same thing to occur on the building. So, what we end up having is two collaborative channels, one that looks like a direct capability and one that's a dealer channel, but the direct would lead the way in and then coordinate dealer activity at the local level. So, call it something of a hybrid model, but it's something we're comfortable with and actually where we believe that we are – we have a pretty strong competency and it's really consistent with the way Trimble has worked for a number of years. But again, I think in terms of the cost structure, we would not expect these efforts to really kind of move traditional relationships in terms of comps.
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you for the color. And then, in Mobile Solutions, can you just talk about whether the transportation and logistics business growth, you said it was double-digit. So, I think we're seeing deliveries in your end markets up 15% to 20%. I'm wondering if you had similar growth in T&L, and can you just update us on how the Field Services transition came along over the course of the quarter?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So, I would say that in a rough sense is – T&L is consistent with those sorts of growth numbers and we actually believe that we're – as the year – as we move deeper into the second half of the year and as we get into 2016, we believe that the trend will accelerate both because of the PACCAR deal that we talked about last quarter, but also we were feeling pretty good about new product introductions that are coming and the impact that they will have. Field Services is still fundamentally a turnaround situation. It is going through a comparatively painful transition, kind of moving away from heavy reliance, historical reliance of small and medium accounts to more enterprise level, more complicated, more work flow oriented solutions and pipeline activity is good. That pipeline will probably not be kind of fully realized until we get into 2016. So, what we're expecting there in terms of profile is for it to continue to be a negative factor from a profitability standpoint on the segment for a couple of quarters more declining over that time period. And during the second half of the year, we're expecting or we're forecasting at this point in time that it ceases to be a significant drag anyway on revenue that – revenue first flat lines and then starts to grow as we get into 2016.
Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Jim Todd - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good afternoon. Could you just cycle back to the Field Solutions business and against that strong double-digit decline in revenue. Could you just kind of speak to how ag did perform and how GIS did perform? And then, maybe the second half of 2015, I guess the expectation is that ag flattens out against at least the fourth quarter comp, is that the expectation there?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So, the expect – pretty explicitly is that particularly with performance we saw in Brazil and performance we're seeing out of the OEMs, which is I think that we had – we're expecting the third quarter to maybe kind of moderate out. I think we're just watching the third quarter at this point of time. But, right now, another drop is in the estimate for the third quarter. Whereas in fourth quarter, which was – which where we saw the really precipitous drop last year. I think that – and a lot of that was inventory effect in the OEM channel. We don't expect – we certainly don't expect the inventory effect to recur in agriculture, and relative to everything else, the – it's getting we're kind of coming to the limits of how much worse the OEM element could get sort of thing. So, right now, we're modeling and with some reasonable expectation of it actually turning out to be true. We're modeling the fourth quarter to be flat in agriculture, and I think, right now, we've got and what I think is a sober and conservative estimate for the third quarter and last year late in the quarter kind of a September effect, we saw a kind of a cliff that we went over in the last two weeks, three weeks of the quarter. So, there may be some moderation that occurs in the third quarter, but that's not kind of implicit in the estimate at this point in time. We're kind of calling it down kind of in a fairly conservative fashion. So, we'll see how the quarter unfolds, but that's the way we're looking at it at this point in time. As far as GIS, GIS was down year-to-year in the second quarter that was consistent. The story for GIS is very similar to kind of the story that was more survey focused in the script. But GIS is relatively heavily dependent on kind of the oil factors or oil regions as well, and so, that kind of pull GIS along with it, but – so, GIS was also down in the quarter, and we're expecting it to reflect kind of more or less same profile as the survey equipment they tend to operate in tandem to some extent.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sure. And then, can we just ask the – when I – I think you had suggested and really repeated that you expect second half 2015 revenue to be up over the first half, maybe not at the same pace you did a week ago or prior to this quarter, but again with the third quarter revenue guidance at the midpoint at $545 million. It does suggest the fourth quarter is got to be solidly north of $600 million?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Well, I'm not sure that we've ever said, called out a relationship between second half and first half. I think, we've always talked in terms of second half 2015 versus second half 2014. And, okay, last quarter, we were a bit more bullish, I would say about the third quarter and kind of the Brazil, the China and the kind of the Ag OEM has made us a bit more careful about third quarter. I think our view on the fourth quarter, which is flat to potentially up relative to last year. I think that's still our outlook at this point in time.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Well, it would have to be again, second half of this year over second half last year. The fourth quarter would have to be north of $600 million, and what I'm kind of getting at is, the third quarter to fourth quarter sequential step-up in revenue comes from, which of these core-end markets?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Well. Okay. Let's make sure, we're consistent on the construct. So, I don't think anything we said today actually talks about the full second half. So, third quarter is what we said it was going to be and I think fourth quarter discretely I'm suggesting that revenue level compared to the fourth quarter of last year is flat to up, which would – I believe the fourth quarter last year was roughly $600 million, which would indicate that yeah, it would be or no, it was $564 million or so. And so, I think that we're saying something north of $564 million is probably the outlook for the fourth quarter is just I think we'll get to the fourth quarter – we'll talk more specifically about the fourth quarter in three months. But in general, I think the fourth quarter becomes something of an inflection point leading into 2016, which is flat to up.
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Yeah. Just to kind of follow-up on that, if you're trying to reconcile with things that we said a quarter ago, our general expectations for the second half as it stands today are lower, now than they were three months ago. So, that's what Steve just told you respectfully (46:17).
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, but the step-up, the implied step-up from Q3 revenue to Q4 revenue is probably only $20 million and that could easily be seasonal so. Okay. And then, just one last question, sorry, one last question on the Mobile business. And Steve, the adjusted EBITDA at 14.7%, is the decline there from the first quarter to the second quarter in adjusted EBIT, is that all largely a function of the Field Services business – first quarter was 16%?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So it's largely as a result of that. I think, to a lesser extent, we had also a product transition during the – in the T&L, or Transportation and Logistics group that also impacted, a little bit that sequential drop, but by and large, for the most part it was the Field Services, so you're correct.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. Thank you.
Jim Todd - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Rich?
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. And so, Steve, if I look at the implied operating margin in your third quarter guidance and then make some assumptions about the fourth quarter, it would appear that the calendar 2015 op margin could be significantly lower than the 17% trailing four quarters. And I'm not sure why that wouldn't be a more relevant baseline as we look to next year and trying to get to 20%. I mean it seems like you could be closer to maybe 15.5% or call it maybe 16% for calendar 2016. So, you have another point to point-and-a-half to bridge to get to that 20% and I'm just wondering why that is the more relevant comparison?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Well, I'd say – first of all it hasn't happened yet and therefore rather than kind of building a set of actions around a forecast, I think that we understand fully and completely the trailing 12 months, we're building it off of that as a result. But I think that – I think looking to – we haven't said anything about the fourth quarter and what that might be. So, the third quarter is standing kind of in isolation at this point in time. But again, I think that if you – we could also go back to the third quarter last year which had a 20% plus operating margin and build it off of that in terms of what has happened since then to bring it down from 20%. So, we can search for different baselines. So, I think that one of the exercises I've done is basically gone back to the third quarter last year where we had 20 plus percent operating margins built – in terms of what has impacted that, using that as the baseline and how do we recover that. So, I think, it's a matter of what base you choose for triangulation and I didn't choose the third quarter last year, I didn't choose the third quarter this year. But I think that the trailing 12 months I think provides a sober estimate and okay, we're triangulating off that. But I think the logic of getting to the 20% is still sound. And so, it's obviously a lot more complicated than that, but today was an attempt just to basically say, okay we have a commitment to get to the 20% and okay we do have a path to it, that's a little bit more complicated shall we say than the one we laid out. So, a fair point, but at the same time, I think that it's a matter of okay, what you base what off of and I'm prepared to do it for the third quarter off of the trailing 12 months in three quarters, but I'd like to do it of actuals not a forecast.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Fair enough. Just one more, I don't think you've mentioned your new irrigation product/initiative in agriculture, which you know I thought you were pretty optimistic about heading into the back half of this year with a – I think a rebooted product and distribution around that? I mean, what's the status of that? Is the market still just too challenging for that to gain any traction or how do we think about that, second half of this year and maybe into next year or maybe being something incremental on ag to give you a little above market boost?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So, certainly in the context of 2016, we're looking it to be – for it to be incremental. What we have done is we have built a direct sales force capability. So, we are outtalking to large growers who do a lot of the irrigation. It has maybe not surprisingly turned out to be a relatively conservative market from the standpoint is we have – and typically a farmer who has needs 10 irrigation systems or 15 irrigation systems, will say put it on one, let's try it out, and so, what we've got at this point in time is a number – large number of trials going on. Okay. So, the revenue to-date hasn't been as high as we maybe would have forecasted six months or nine months ago simply because of the adoption process is taking longer. So, like most of the Trimble businesses it is a fairly conservative uptake process in the works. I think we're now in the third quarter and fourth quarter, starting to move out of season. So, I think it really is, so, it hasn't generated revenue sufficient to really being worth talking about in the larger context to that, but we've done a whole lot of learning this year really in the first year of implementation. We have engaged the marketplace. We have talked to a lot of farmers and I think that the probabilities for it to be a meaningful revenue item in 2016 is quite high. So, I think we're, I suppose in a sense, disappointed that the uptake wasn't instantaneous. We were probably naïve in terms of believing that – again the farmer with 15 – who needed 15 systems would order all 15 without seeing a demonstration taking place over some period of months. So I think that is more, it has become more of a 2016 issue than a 2015 issue. Now at the same time from a market standpoint, from a competitor standpoint, we're very pleased with where we stand, we believe we have a unique hit product capability, we have or actually – we have a unique solutions capability because we've taken the base product. We have integrated with other capabilities, and there is – it's evolved into more of a water management system. So from that standpoint, we're quite happy with where we stand. But again, I think it has turned into more of a 2016 potential than a 2015 in terms of moving the needle for agriculture.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for that color, Steve.
Operator: Our next question is from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey, guys, thank you for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more, provide some more detail around the lower oil impact and kind of expectations of when you think that will improve. I mean you previously mentioned Steve, that you expected second quarter to kind of be the bottom. I mean what are you expecting now for when that impact is going to stabilize and when we potentially start to see improvement?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So, I think that probably when we look back I wouldn't – I would guess I wouldn't doubt anyway that probably the second quarter does kind of – first quarter and second quarter particularly together represent the low point. Now, I think that probably the oil producing regions themselves are going to languish for a period of time. But I think, two effects, one, when we get into the – when we get to the – into the fourth quarter and to the first quarter, at least the year-to-year comparison that's to be easier. So, we've got that, but I think as a – from a company standpoint is because of our relative market share in the GNSS, GPS. We have been a kind of overrepresented in the oil exploration area and we have actually I think had a stronger presence in the oil producing regions than maybe more – some of the competition. I think what we need to do as a company and that's what we're doing at this point in time is, okay, a reallocating mine share, reallocating resources, reallocating marketing programs kind of a way from a focus on oil at least until it's starts to come back until we see the oil prices going up. And redirect our points of emphasis to other areas, that's taking place at this point in time. So, I think that yeah aside from kind of the year-to-year comparison relief we see later in the – at the end of the year, I think we're seeing, let's call early signs of the benefits of this redirection of activity. So, I think we don't have to be a victim to the oil price effects. I think we can take proactive efforts, we're doing that. So, I would say is that right now I maybe speaking too early without a whole lot of – without enough data really to support in a big way. I would expect 2015 to actually be for our Geospatial business a reasonably robust growth year, but we need to get from now until then, but that's what's going on and I think that it will be a situation that corrects itself.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thanks, Steven. And just looking at China quickly with the increased weakness, uncertainty there, do you have concerns about the Beijing airport contract that's been awarded, that you received and that's getting further postponed or any of kind of future opportunities that you are thinking of?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: No, actually I think, probably, okay – again I'm China no expert, but I think what we're – we saw in China in the second quarter was probably more headline effects than anything else. I think, the fundamentals of China are still strong. I wouldn't see at all that the Beijing airport deal or kind of the other infrastructure deals are in any real jeopardy. I think what we saw was again the headline factor, where people that were potentially going to invest in the second quarter with the relative volatility of the stock market just decided to postpone differ and reconsider. So, I think, there is a fair chance that what we saw in China in the second quarter and kind of self corrects in quite a hurry and that it doesn't actually reflect anything fundamental. We'll see, but I think it's highly probable that the second – our second quarter results didn't necessarily reflect anything terribly fundamental about China.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks again for taking my questions.
Jim Todd - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: Our last and final question in the queue will be from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Yes, thanks for fitting me in. Steve, you talked about improving the distribution channel in ag and replicating some of your SITECH success in E&C, but as you probably know, farmers are skeptical bunch, I mean, even when faced with a good ROI value proposition. So, how do you expect to really win over this market with channel and customer education?
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Well, okay, so, I think it's – yeah, so, without a doubt I would expect agriculture and I think we've been consistent the same as over a period of time. Is agriculture – we see a transformation in both construction and agriculture. We would see the transformation occurring in construction much more rapidly than agriculture. So, the value proposition in construction is that, by using technology you can reduce project cost by 25% or 30%. Okay, that the competitive forces in construction are strong enough, is that – okay – I think the – those contractors who don't adapt will be out of business in fairly short orders. So, construction I think will occur rapidly. I think agriculture is a more conservative, a more patience sort of market. It will take longer. I think the end result will be very much the same of agriculture being transformed through the use of the information. So, I think that there is going to be – I think that against kind of what – the speculation of last few years in terms of time phased projections. I think it will turn out to be a slower developing market than people have been saying. At the same time, it will happen, it will be a big change and I think that fundamental to that change will be an edge, a channel that can deliver value to the customer that is – that becomes a trusted advisor to the farmer, and I think that becomes the fundamental consideration, which is to really reflect the level of neutrality and level of trust with the farmer turning over data to if you will, a third-party is an act of trust. So, I think that's fundamental. So, I think we're putting the basis in play to make that happen. I think we're being – let's call it appropriately sober, saying on time expectations, but I think it's the first step of many. So, I think that starting from a low level, I think we should see good growth coming from it, but we're not projecting a rocket ship here.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Great. And then from my follow-up Francois, I mean how long will it take for currency translation impacts to play out? I mean the dollar didn't get any strong in Q2, but obviously there is some sort of lag in the pricelists adjusting. And once the pricelists do fully adjust, there is some demand consequences at that point. Thanks.
Francois Delepine - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So each division kind of adjust to the situation the kind of best they can with regards to pricing. We see the impact in Q3 to be – I mean the current rate to be a little bit lower than it was in Q2, but we quantify that is about 4%. In Q3, it will also be a little bit lower than we would expect to see it in – in Q4, rather we expect to see it bit a lower than in Q3. So, we're thinking about $20 million – $25 million in Q3, about $20 million in Q4, and then starts reducing after that still more – still a little bit in the Q1 and then after that in Q2 assuming current rates obviously will start lapping that and thoughts on demand issues once the price is fully addressed.
Steven W. Berglund - President & Chief Executive Officer, Executive Committee Member: Yeah. So, you kind of expect things to neutralize themselves, so we may see some a good results. Now if you look at the results in Europe actually if you exclude the impact of FX and the distributor revenue recognition event that we had last year. So, which kind of impacted the year-over-year comparison. Europe was actually up 9%. So it kind of indicates that there is strong demand locally.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Caitlin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Jim Todd, you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd: Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Francois Delepine, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release which is available, along with additional financial information, on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. First quarter results were consistent with the narrative from the fourth quarterly call, although we fell outside of our revenue guidance in the quarter. Three months ago, we expected the first half of the year to be a challenge, which is turning out to be true. We also expect the second half results to demonstrate meaningful improvement, which continues to be our expectation. In this case, the definition of improvement would be a return to high single-digit revenue growth and a return to an operating margin converging on 20%. We had a revenue surprise in the quarter, which is emphatically not part of our historical culture. We are addressing the issue with a series of organizational actions I will explain later. As anticipated, the weakness in agriculture continued, although we believe our ability to forecast the business is better than it was in the second half of last year. We obviously need to be wary of market volatility, particularly among the agricultural OEMs, but we think we are seeing some signs of stabilization. We are currently forecasting our agriculture revenue in the second quarter to be down from last year. But absent the OEM inventory effects of 2014, we see agriculture being closer to flat year-to-year on the second half of the year and into the first part of 2016. Even if they course our -- agricultural machine sales are down by another 15% in the second half. The dollar further strengthened against the rate we had used to setting guidance which pushed revenue down. It had a differential impact on earnings at the segment level, although the earnings impact at the consolidated level was relatively small. The weather in the Northern and Eastern U.S. in the first quarter had a significant effect on those regions' construction and geospatial sales and postponed the typical search we see in the final 4 to 6 weeks of the first quarter. Against total company revenue, this is not particularly material and that it represents about 1% to 2% of revenue, but the exchange rate effect and the weather effect, in combination, pushed us out of the revenue guidance range. The primary driver, which drove our revenue down in the quarter, was a nonanticipated drop in geospatial sales primarily in North America. Some of this was the impact of weather in the Northern and Eastern U.S. and some was exchange rates. Given that the drop was centered in North America, there is no macroeconomic rationale that explains the drop. In addition, market share data shows us to be either in stable or improving market position. The decrease is centered in the oil-producing regions and the oil price decline appears to be the causal factor. Last quarter, we described the primary expected impact on us of the oil price shock to be approximately 1% of total company revenue or $25 million per year. This judgment appears to remain valid. What we did not adequately anticipate were the secondary effects. The oil bust has put a damper on the oil-producing regional economies and has caused a generalized pull-back of investment activity. This has played out, in our case, by a sharp reduction in inventory in the channel in certain regions. Although the market may normalize later in the year, we have added more conservatism to our geospatial expectations. Construction, the other large component of E&C was also impacted in the quarter by exchange rates, weather and regionalized secondary effects of the oil price, although the oil price effects are much less severe than in geospatial. The heavy civil component of construction also continues to be negatively impacted by the mediocre international economic environment, most particularly by Australia. The fundamentals remain strong, and we expect to regain traction as we work through these short-term issues. The Mobile Solutions segment performance showed improvement in the quarter, and we expect even better performance in the second half, largely based on the Transportation & Logistics business. At the moment, this segment is the best-performing element of Trimble. Europe, both North and South, is showing more buoyancy than we have seen in some time aside from the exchange translation effects. An offsetting factor is the trend for Russia, which continues to deteriorate, and the negative outlook for Brazil. If the European trend develops, this would be meaningful for us since Europe constitutes over 1/4 of our revenue and has not been a significant constructive part of our story for years. It is too early to be conclusive since there are competing European positives and negatives, the ongoing Greek crisis being the primary negative and lower energy costs and a traded damaged euro being the positives. Last quarter, I described the need for improved performance from specific elements of our business portfolio. These are agriculture in the Field Solutions segment; the real estate and workplace solutions business, which includes Manhattan Software and E&C; and construction supply and Field Services management, which are in Mobile Solutions. Beyond the obvious impact of agriculture, the combined effects of these businesses currently represent meaningful trades and current results, and create potential future opportunities. We believe all of these are growth businesses and add to the Trimble franchise, and expect to see all of them demonstrate meaningful progress in 2015. Manhattan Software should show a lift later in the year as we resolve the initial post-acquisition revenue recognition accounting challenges. The construction supply business is anticipating growing strength during the year based on the improving economy in the U.S. and a stronger product portfolio. Field Solutions and the Mobile Solutions segment is looking at a strong orders pipeline, which leads to a trend of improvement in the second half of the year and a stronger 2016. Although we stumbled in the quarter against our expectations, we have a number of recent examples of strategic process -- progress that foreshadow future revenue. Let me identify 3 of them. All 3 of these announcements are based on capabilities that have been assembled over the last several years through a combination of internal development and selective technology focused to acquisitions that have created strong franchise effects. The first is the public announcement of our win of our Beijing new airport project for what the customers calling a construction information system. Beijing's new airport project is designed with a target of 72 million travelers and 620,000 flights in 2025, and represents one of the most challenging and highest profiled projects to be awarded in 2015. The project has an explicit objective of establishing a new standard in digital construction of large strategic projects. Trimble won with a web-based construction workflow management solution that allows construction operations to be monitored real time. This project should provide meaningful leverage as a reference account and highlights that Trimble has a competitively unique portfolio of capabilities centered on the constructible model that can move the needle on construction site operations. We also announced during the quarter a new multiyear alliance with Paccar, the manufacturer of trucks, including the Kenworth and Peterbilt brands. This will significantly boost our T&L subscriber base in the Mobile Solutions segment and have a meaningful impact on revenue later in 2015 and throughout 2016. It involves installing Trimble hardware in the factory in every Kenworth and Peterbilt truck with an MX engine. Trimble will provide remote diagnostic services for a monthly recurring fee. This opportunity is attractive in its own right. But beyond the base point capability, it provides a significant platform for us to upsell additional fleet management solutions. Just as we talked about the next fleet problem with construction machines, the same problem exists in transportation. The Paccar platform gives us a head start in solving transportation's next-fleet challenge. This win can be attributed to the synergistic effects of Trimble's unique ability to bring together the elements of mobility, enterprise and analytics into one bundle. Another event that has longer-term meaning related to the announcement yesterday that Microsoft and Trimble are working together to develop a new generation of tools integrated with Windows HoloLens holographic platform on Windows 10, which is intended to improve quality, collaboration and efficiency in the design, construction and the operation of buildings and structures. Proof of concept for the solution was demonstrated yesterday at Microsoft's Build Developer Conference in San Francisco. Augmented reality, which Microsoft calls mixed reality, is becoming real and can have a major impact on how work gets done. The ability to juxtapose models' information and virtual collaboration in the context of the real world and do this in a natural comfortable way is all new. The technology is applicable in many of Trimble's markets, but the initial focus will be in construction and geospatial. We contemplate things like facilities managers who can see all of the building model elements and status as they walk through a building or the office designer who can take a workstation out of Trimble's 3D warehouse and digitalize it right in the workspace where it will be used. In Microsoft's published video, you can see SketchUp in use with HoloLens and an integration with Trimble's V10 imagery capture product. A link to the video is available on Trimble's website. While the demonstrations yesterday highlighted Trimble's technology capabilities and were not a product announcement, they did represent Trimble leadership and what will be an important applied technology and our intention to be a leader in the commercial development of that technology. Although we expect some natural lift in the second half of the year, we are not satisfied with our current management performance and are taking actions to improve it. We have therefore launched a number of changes to improve our ability to deliver against expectations, maintain margins and execute strategically. In the last 3 months, we have taken significant cost reduction steps by reducing headcount by over 115 with accompanying steps to reduce other costs. The magnitude of the recent cuts is over $15 million annualized. Our business model supports the expectation that we can operate with an aggregate 20% non-GAAP operating margin, and we will take actions to regain that model. In the last 3 months, we also undertook a significant reorganization. This includes changes at multiple levels of the organization, including senior executives. This change in roles and alignments is intended to improve both our short term and strategic execution with a singular focus on making the numbers. The organizational changes have concentrated more authority with individuals who have a history of execution. The realignment also recognizes the changing nature of Trimble, which is rapidly becoming more focused on software and solutions, away from hardware, and therefore requires different skills and capabilities within the management group. Although we have had a plan of organizational change, the current challenges helped motivated us to accelerate the process. Our focus is on aligning individuals within the right structure to enable effective execution of a market strategy that remains as robust as ever in terms of producing growth. At the senior management levels, let me identify both recent and pending changes, all of these are direct reports to me. Peter Large, who is responsible for Trimble's distribution channel strategy development, departed in December. Last week, we announced that Chris Gibson, a long-term Trimble sector head focused on the geospatial businesses, will take over the significantly expanded role with specific mandates to accelerate our development in emerging geographical regions, professional services and key accounts. Bryn Fosburgh, who has led the sector focused on the construction businesses, will add the geospatial business to his portfolio. Mark Harrington, who leads the sector that includes agriculture, will retire as planned in the middle part of the year. We have launched a search for a successor that will include both internal and external candidates. During the last month, Mike Scarpa has joined us as Chief Human Resource Officer. He comes with experience at HARMAN electronics, ABB and GE. His primary focus will be on developing the skills and organizational processes consistent with a more complex environment. We continue to expect to establish an inflection point at midyear and to reestablish and up into the right revenue trend in the second half of the year after 3 quarters of failing to produce growth. We believe our forecast is sober and possibly conservative, although it needs to be quantified by the possibility of any new shocks from the environment. Let me identify the discrete elements of the analysis for the second half. First, at current exchange rates, we will start out 4% to 5% in the hole from a revenue perspective. Second, the acquisitions already enhanced should produce 4% of growth. Third, we are assuming our agricultural sales to be basically flat in the second half of 2015 year-to-year. We believe this is an objective view after 18 months of declines in our agriculture revenue. It does not assume any kind of recovery in commodity prices or the equipment market. If we can achieve stability in our base business, we can then start to reintroduce the concept of incremental growth in 2016 through the development of new product categories. Fourth, we are anticipating strong growth in the Mobile Solutions segment in the second half, much of which is already in backlog. For the rest of the company, we are forecasting relatively modest organic growth at least until we better understand the full secondary effects of the oil price impact. The combination of these effects leads to a view of the year that is consistent directionally with the outlook we described last quarter. Exchange rates and the full effect of the oil price shock have added additional headwinds, but the signs from Europe and a sense of the stabilization in agriculture may offset some of that. We have stumbled recently on short-term results, but the 3-year view on potential remains unchanged. We simply need to execute. Let me turn the call over to Francois.
Francois Delepine: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Before getting to the numbers, please note that unless otherwise indicated, the operating results I will discuss will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is in our earnings press release along with the financial data by segment. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. So now let's first cover the first quarter results. Q1 total revenue was $583 million down 4% year-over-year. Currency translation added approximately 4% year-over-year unfavorable effect roughly offset by growth from acquisitions. Relative to our original expectations for the quarter, the shortfall in revenue came primarily from FX deterioration during the quarter, combined with softness in our E&C segment, largely driven by weather and oil and gas weakness. We estimate that this weather and oil and gas weakness added 3% to 4% year-on-year unfavorable effect. Our Field Solutions segment was also soft, as expected, with agriculture showing some signs of stabilization. Now looking at our revenue by segment. Engineering and Construction segment revenue was down 3%. Currency translation added approximately 5% unfavorable revenue effect year-over-year, roughly offset by growth from acquisitions. While some of the portfolio did well, our results in E&C, in particular in geospatial and to a lesser extent in heavy civil, were severely impacted by weather and oil and gas weakness. More specifically, Trimble Buildings growth was strong. Geospatial revenue was unexpectedly down in the mid-teens, impacted primarily by FX, weather and weakness in certain regions with significant oil and gas exposure. Heavy Civil was down single digits impacted by FX, lower sales in Canada, also largely attributable to oil and gas, as well as continued weakness in Australia. Overall, the estimated effect of weather and oil and gas was approximately 7% to 8% unfavorable on the E&C segment. The divestment of a distributor also added unfavorable impact on the E&C segment of approximately 1% year-over-year. Field Solutions segment revenue was down 17% year-over-year, due primarily to weakness in the agriculture business. Agriculture was down in the mid-teens but showed signs of stabilization in the market that remains quite difficult. The agriculture weakness was widespread, but continue to be more pronounced in OEM factory installed. Currency translation had approximately 5% unfavorable year-over-year impact in the Field Solutions segment. Acquisition had a minor positive impact. GIS was also down significantly year-over-year in that segment. Mobile Solutions segment revenue was up 8% year-over-year and would have been up double digits without the 3% negative FX impact. The Transportation & Logistics business growth was strong in the mid-teens. Segment results were also modestly impacted by the divestiture in Q4 of a nonstrategic business. Advanced Devices went up 3% in the first quarter. Now looking at our revenue by geography: 53.1% of Q1 revenue was from North America, 25.2% from Europe, 15.2% from Asia-Pacific and 6.5% from rest of the world. North America was down 4% year-over-year. The largest impact in North America was the agriculture weakness in the U.S. with the Field Solutions segment down over 20% year-over-year. E&C was down single digits in North America, driven primarily by weakness in regions with significant exposure to oil and gas and, in particular, Canada. Europe was down 5% year-over-year, primarily impacted by currency. However, we're seeing improving trends within Europe in constant currency terms. Currency had approximately 14% unfavorable impact year-over-year. And adjusted for this impact, Europe grew approximately 9%. E&C, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions in Europe all grew year-over-year in constant currency terms, with the positive shift in particular for our agriculture business. Russia, as expected, continued to be down significantly overall. Asia-Pacific was up 1% year-over-year. China continued with solid growth. India growth accelerated albeit of a relatively low numbers. On the flip side, Australia remained weak and was down significantly year-over-year. Currency also had an approximately 2% unfavorable impact year-over-year on Asia-Pacific. Rest of the world was down 10% year-over-year. The Middle East and Africa were down due to a challenging comp from first quarter 2014. South America was up, positively impacted by a rebound in agriculture results. The impact of currency on the rest of the world was minor. Now turning to revenue by type. We're continuing to see a shift in our portfolio towards a more significant mix of software recurring revenue and services. In Q1, product revenue was 69% of total, service revenue was 17% of the total and subscription revenue was 14% of total. Product revenue, which includes both hardware and software licenses, was down 9% year-over-year. Within that number, however, software license revenue grew. Service revenue, which includes maintenance support, the extended warranties and professional services, was up 8% year-over-year, with growth driven primarily by Gehry Technologies, Manhattan and Amtech, which were acquired in the second half of 2014. Subscription revenue, which includes SaaS and other subscription services, was up 18% year-over-year. The subscription revenue strengths reflect the combination of organic growth and the impact of acquisitions. The majority of our service and subscription revenue is recurring in nature, and recurring revenue overall was also up significantly year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margins decreased to 56.8% in the first quarter compared to 57.6% in the first quarter of 2014. FX had a negative impact as some of our products sold at foreign currencies are sourced in U.S. dollars. Product mix also had a negative impact to gross margins, particularly in E&C, where the positive impact of higher subscription revenues were negated by unfavorable mix in the product revenue category and an increase in professional services. Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $96.8 million or 16.6% of revenue, as compared to 21.2% of revenue in the prior year. Total company operating income percentage was negatively impacted by a number of factors. The major impacts were lower revenue in E&C and agriculture and, to a lesser extent, recent acquisitions. The impact of currency translation in company operating margins was small. We have a large cost base in Europe and other countries, which mitigates the impact on operating income. As we discussed last quarter, recent acquisitions are performing to business expectations and the negative impacts of acquisition accounting will dissipate after the first half of 2015. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 2015 was 24%, which we currently expect to see for the remainder of 2015. Q1 net income of $72.7 million was down 29% as compared to Q1 '14. Diluted earnings per share were $0.28, down 28% as compared to Q1 '14. As Steve mentioned, we've been taking steps to reduce expenses which should materialize mostly in the second half. Q1 operating cash flow was $107 million and up 29% from Q1 '14. Strong cash flow performance relative to net income resulted from lower working capital. Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the first quarter 2015 with $146 million in cash. Account receivable was $383 million with day sales outstanding of 60 days, and ending inventory was $276 million. Deferred revenue increased to a record $282 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year. The increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects changes in the mix of our revenue towards more software and subscription offerings and include the impact of acquisitions. That decreased by $75 million in the quarter ending at $663 million versus $738 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2014. Our debt-to-equity ratio and leverage ratio, the gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, remained at comfortable levels in the quarter at 0.3x and 1.35x, respectively. During the first quarter, we repurchased 478,000 shares of Trimble common stock for a total of $12.6 million. We repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares for $110 million over the trailing 12 months. From a capital allocation standpoint, our first priorities remain to fund the business both internally and through acquisitions. With a combination of strong operating cash flows, our near-term acquisition pipeline and a comfortable leverage ratio, at this point we expect to be more active with share repurchases in Q2. Our stock repurchase program has a remaining authorization of $237 million. I will now turn to our guidance for Q2 2015. We expect second quarter revenue to be between $570 million and $600 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.30. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $40 million related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $4 million, the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of $13 million and $5 million in anticipated restructuring charges. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assumes approximately 262 million shares outstanding and a 24% non-GAAP tax rate. This non-GAAP tax rate assumes that the R&D tax credit will be reenacted for 2015. Our Q2 revenue guidance assume that we continue to see the headwinds we experienced in Q1 with the agriculture market and the oil and gas market. Q2 revenue guidance also assumes an unfavorable currency translation impact of approximately 5%. In addition, Q2 '14 benefited from a positive revenue recognition event involving a distributor, also creating an unfavorable revenue growth impact of approximately 2%. As Steve discussed, we're taking a number of cost actions to ensure that we can better manage operating margins. We expect these actions to have a minor impact in Q2 and a positive impact in the back half of 2015. We expect larger-than-normal restructuring charges in the quarter associated with these actions, as I mentioned above. With that, we'll now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Steve, could you just kind of walk through maybe the setup here a little bit on the mobile side of the business, in particular T&L? Obviously, these EDL mandates that have kicked in this summer it feels like we should be quite well positioned there with PeopleNet, TMW and some of our relationships that we have had in place. So maybe we could just talk how you see that unfolding and if your enterprise-level approach gives you an advantage in that market.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I think you're right. I think that we consciously attempt to build what's called a franchise about mobility and enterprise and actually analytics. Within this mix, we have a pretty robust and growing analytics business, which gives us, I think, in many cases, a differentiated advantage as well. So I think that up until quite recently, it's taken time to bring together the elements, so we were operating maybe more at the PowerPoint level than the reality. I think the Paccar deal, for example, shows the relative power of kind of having all the elements within one umbrella and being able to speak to mix and match to situations. So I would say that in terms of capabilities, we are unique as a company. I think that as that mandate and just the drives for productivity and driver safety in general and such play out as we have the ability to craft better solutions than anyone else. And in reality, over the last 6 to 9 months in particular, at the product level, we have integrated the PeopleNet and TMW capabilities. And what you'll see more over the next 12 to 18 months is a more unified, more integrated approach to the marketplace. So we think we have an advantage. We think we're executing on that advantage and we still have some things to do but I think we're in good shape.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then can I just one follow-up here? Just -- can I clarify a comment that I think that you made at the beginning of your presentation, Steve, where returning to kind of normal footing here in the second half of the year suggest I think you saves mid-single-digit second-half revenue growth inclusive of FX and operating margins around 20% or at least that's the target? Is that the goal that's here for the second half?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I was on script. I said, high-single-digit revenue growth, not mid-single-digit revenue growth. Yes, and that's inclusive of the FX effects.
Francois Delepine: Right. And the 20% was a moving towards 20%.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And Francois, just one question for you and then I'm off. But in the E&C segment, can you give us a sense of what the amount of revenue that was deferred off the acquisitions either in dollars? Or potentially, or possibly, can you tell us what the operating margin would be exclusive of the deferred revenue, in other words, if you include the deferred revenue in an adjusted number, adjusted revenue number?
Francois Delepine: Yes, so let me try to answer that. I'll give you some elements for the answer, which is that we continue to have a little bit of deferred revenue from the acquisitions on the balance sheet. But Q1 was a much more normal quarter compared to Q4 in that respect. And overall, the acquisition, I would say, had about a 2-point negative impact on the sector OI.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to talk a little bit about some of the changes that you made at the executive level. And can you maybe give us a sense of what those changes might bring in terms of either strategic or execution changes and sort of the time frame for those to have an impact on the business?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think this may not be what's called a comprehensive view. But I think, first of all, in terms of impact, I think the idea here is to in some ways have an immediate impact, both an immediate impact and a longer-term impact. So I think this is both, if you will, a little bit tactical as well strategic. So I think that we've missed a number of quarters here within the last year. I think part of this was to kind of maybe recover a little bit of the historical Trimble culture in terms of singular accountabilities for numbers. And so some of the changes down in the organization related to kind of realigning sales management and getting a stronger accountability for the number in the hands of people that have kind of demonstrated the ability to both forecast the number and deliver the numbers. So some of it this is just, if you will, hard-knock short-term accountability and a kind of a reemphasis on that. Now when I talked about the Chris Gibson reassignment, that is also a bit strategic when we talk about getting a little bit more of a hard-charging focus on the emerging economies, whether it'd be in China or whether it'd be in India or the like, is that we've had a dispersed accountability for geographies spread among a number of people. Chris will be responsible for the country managers in those places. And the idea here is, this is about an organizational change as well as, let's call it, a process change. But the idea here is to get more specific focus on what we're doing in countries like India and to align the organization around both short-term and long-term actions. I also mentioned relative to Chris' key accounts, which is a significant success criteria for Trimble in the next few years. Just as we landed the Beijing job, there are other jobs out there we need to bring singular organization focus on those. And then as part of the key account effort, more focused on professional services, so we acquired Gehry Technologies, which gave us a step function in professional services, so that will report to Chris. So part of this is to, if you will, create a single point of focus within the company for being able to concentrate resources where we need to do that. And then I think part of the next is this is a long-standing management group is -- I think times like this where we have missed is a good time to say, "Okay, have we gotten a little more comfortable with our historical patterns of management?" And so I think shaking that up. So in terms of the Mark Harrington retirement and his replacement, I think we will consider bringing in an outsider, in part, just to kind of liven up the diversity of the viewpoint within the senior group. So I don't know that there are any, call it, dramatic step changes involved, but I think this is to improve focus and, in particular, improve focus on accountability around the set of numbers.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And then just as a follow-up. I mean, as we look at the agriculture business, both the results this quarter and sort of your expectations for improvement towards the second half of the year, what kind of surprised you this quarter outside of the currency impacts? And maybe explain some of the delta between your internal forecast and maybe the outcomes? And how do you sort of think about this across both the aftermarket and OEM channels? And particularly, as you look forward, how do you sort of reconcile the revised guidance with that perspective?
Steven W. Berglund: You're talking about agriculture alone or...
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Specific to ag, specific to ag.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. So first of all, we were on our number for the quarter. So if you will, there were not -- no kind of net changes. We were on the number that we have forecasted for agriculture. What gives us some confidence is that we're getting control of our market model in agriculture. So I don't think there were any significant negative surprises either coming out of the OEM realm or elsewhere. I think it was more or less as expected, some pluses or minuses. Now the thing is, kind of peeling back the onion without expressing a premature kind of optimism here, there are a number of things happening within agriculture that it provides some level of improving confidence. So if you look at the performance of channels within agriculture, the best performing channel is our own aftermarket channel. Second comes the OEMs' channels, and third comes OEMs. So in a sense, it's our own channel which gives us a little bit more of maybe a picture of what is really possible in the market, not for technology, not for equipment, that channel is performing relatively better again. And then the emerging markets geographically are also outperforming the rest. So there are a lot of moving pieces here and some of them are actually positive. So still a volatile market, it's still uncertain. We are still assuming as part of our market model that equipment sales will be down in the second half of the year, year-to-year. But we think that our particular set of circumstances enables us to, say, play flat year-to-year, and we would see that continuing into 2016. And then we can hopefully start to engineer maybe some upside movement once we achieve that kind of stability.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Steve, so you had this big win in Beijing, what was the magnitude of it? And what can you tell us about the pipeline of software-related sales, and to what extent hardware sales come attached?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So given the sensitivity of this one is -- let's just describe it as being 7 figures with, what I would call, meaningful tag-along capability. So we got the kind of top of the mountain sort of territory here that is a large project. There'll be a lot of tag-along with it and now we're well positioned to capture that as well. But 7 figures there. I would say the software -- kind of the software-oriented pipeline in terms of the number points of engagement around the world for this kind of project is growing. It's not a needle-mover in 2015. Hopefully, in 2016, it becomes a much more significant part of the conversation. And I think that exactly what the bundle is in any of these deals is circumstantial, but I would say Trimble has the ability to walk into a C-level suite of a contractor and offer up a comprehensive solution that involves software and hardware. So I would say the significant majority of these sorts of arrangements would involve both hardware and software simply because it's all bundled. The hardware isn't in reality, just a note in an information that works. So the hardware would typically go with the software side. I would say, without being particularly specific, is the pipeline is growing, the points of engagement is growing. And again, back to the organizational issue. We're organizing more aggressively around the idea of pursuing the big project deal, such as Beijing deal.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, just going back to the pipeline, if I may. Do you have dozens or hundreds of potential deals in the pipeline? And if there's a medium size to these deals, what would it be?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think probably in any given 6-month period, there are hundreds of conversations. But probably to bring some level of reality to it, if you counted the number of large -- medium to large projects around the world at any point in time, there are probably dozens in some sort of serious conversation where there's some level of planning taking place. And again, I would say medium-size would be pretty -- kind of variable. But I would say it is for a large project, it would be kind of typically. And depending on scope, depending on circumstances, would be again kind of 7-figure numbers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So you had a big win with Paccar. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you expect the timing on the Navistar sourcing decision, when do you expect that to play out. And then just broadly touch on how you feel about your opportunities to get on other platforms as the factory default. In U.S. truck, I think you have a relationship with Volvo, but they've been single sourced with a competitor until now. Can you just flesh out the opportunity set to the extent you feel comfortable?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, my comfort level is not particularly high here. I mean, these are -- any conversations we are having is, I think, pretty confidential and I don't want to, by talking about it, create a dynamic here where we're irritating the other side. So I'm going to take a pass, basically, on the question and avoid the question simply to avoid getting myself into a problem here. But let's just say that we are engaged with the number of players and sometimes elements of it are not press releasable, but I think I'm just going to have to tell you to wait for the press release.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then separately, on Field Solutions business, the outlook flat ag revenue in the back half of the year, can you just talk about what kind of tractor production environment you're calibrated to? So CNH, I know you're in lockstep with them. They're talking about a 40% production cut in large ag and meaningful excess inventory at the dealer and company levels. So can you just calibrate us when you say flat ag in the back half of the year? What kind of tractor production environment are we thinking about?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think that in terms of tractor environment, the numbers seems to be shifting around over time in terms of -- if you listen to the major producers, it does seem to be shifting around. I would say it's basically kind of if I were to name a number in terms of implicit in our assumption or our set of assumptions, they lead to our own view of the market. We're assuming kind of the year to be down, the first half of the year to be down probably in the 30% to 30%-plus realm for tractors. The second part of the year, we would expect as the year -- as manufacturers lap themselves, we're kind of more on the 15%, 20% down range. So as I said in the script is that we're kind of in our market model. We are assuming that, in general, tractor sales will be down on the order of 15% in the second half of the year. So there seems to be a little bit of a census that maybe the numbers haven't been quite as bad as they were originally forecasted in terms tractors out the door. There is still too much inventory in the channel for the manufacturers, which is not a secondary sort of consideration for us, mostly what we're interested in the sell-through to the ultimate market. The channel inventory doesn't matter particularly to us since we had our own channel inventory adjustment in the second half of last year. So I would say, those are kind of what's implicit in our numbers and that's what our market model is assuming, and then we've got a whole model built around kind of the aftermarket. And again, right now the aftermarket is significantly outselling the factory in terms of technology.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And lastly, the 15% to 20% end market outgrowth that you're looking for, for your business to be flat in ag in the back half of the year, are there any new product contribution in there? Is there an irrigation piece in there? Or any new products that you're rolling out on the aftermarket side, because I guess it's been a while since we've seen that level of outperformance in ag?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So we are again -- as I said, we are seeing some points of life. There are not enough of them and they're not big enough to really kind of wave the flag too much. But, for example, we came out with a new display in the first quarter, the TMX. We did outperform our expectations in the first quarter on that product. So during the course of 2014, we were talking about the ability to outperform the market based on new product introductions and new product category -- new product categories being introduced. The TMX display, it kind of gets lost in the shuffle because of the big moves in numbers. For example, that did beat our quarter 1 expectations. The Connected Farm Advisor, which is a piece of software we put out there. It's a subscription-based. Okay, that is still very small, not necessarily worth trying to quote a set of numbers on it yet. But okay, we are seeing uptick there. And you talked about the irrigation product. We now have built out our direct sales force on the irrigation. There's a lot of engagement. We're going to have to see how quickly that monetizes. But certainly, against the scale of involvement on the irrigation that we had even 6 months ago is substantially higher. So that is all resonant in the second half assumption or the second half forecast. They're not big numbers, still guidance that drives the numbers. But all of that is resonant in that number. So it's a lot of moving parts, but in aggregate, we think that provides upside. Now just in terms of the raw numbers, the year-to-year comparison during the second half of 2014 we were subjected to OEM significant inventory adjustments where we saw demand just absolutely in a matter of days just fall to nothing. And so if nothing else, in the second half of the year, we'll have a much easier comp situation. But even beyond that, we see kind of this environment continuing into 2016 at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors from Boenning and Scattergood.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit about this aftermarket versus OEM dynamic that you talked a lot about here. And I guess there's a lot of talk about a shift going on in the industry from kind of the traditional aftermarket sales and precision agriculture into more and more of an OEM embedded type model. And much of this happened kind of in the automobile industry, for example. And yet obviously, you're talking about aftermarket being relatively strong. What's your view, Steve, on that shift? Is it -- is that happening in the industry or not in your view? And if so, what is the impact of that on the business?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think, certainly, from a secular strategic standpoint, this has been our assumption all along, is that in terms of the base capability kind of the box and the receiver, GPS receiver, that's in agriculture and it's not nearly as true as in construction, just as parenthetically. But in agriculture, yes, so the base capability, the ability to -- the box and the receiver will continually move more towards a factory install. Now our longer-term strategy is that's fine, we'll participate with the OEMs on that. Where we see the bigger dollars down the road is actually selling software and data-related services that utilize the factory installed capability for positioning computing power. So our model is more expansive than just being a provider to OEMs. Now here in the short term -- so that's a long-term trend, and so there's a secular trend, we acknowledge that, we accept that. But here in the short term, significant parts of the emerging world are still aftermarket. So you go to China, you go to places like that, it's aftermarket. Those are actually, at the moment, the more dynamic markets where we're seeing significant take-up. Our OEM channels were down in the quarter kind of more than 20%, whereas our channel, the Trimble channel, was down single digits. So there is -- at this moment in time, there is a significant difference in kind of just performance levels. And maybe that's to be expected is that a farmer if we achieve some level of stability -- now farm sentiment is still pretty rocky. The farm psychology is still pretty negative. But if a farmer feels any kind of stability, the farmer may choose to defer the investment in the new tractor for a year or 2, whatever, they just postpone it. Whereas with the new feature set technology, and Trimble has been coming up with -- continually with new features, features on our products, the farmer may decide to retrofit the existing tractor with a new version of the technology. And I suspect that's part of the story for why Trimble's aftermarket is doing reasonably well. We should be going back in either upselling or retroselling an installed installation because maybe after 5 years, the feature set has expanded enough to make it attractive for the farmer to upgrade an existing installation. So there will always be an aftermarket either selling kind of extended versions of the technology or selling software and data services. So it's not as though the factory is going to push the aftermarket completely out of the game. They will continue to exist side by side.
Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: Got it, that's helpful. And then my other question just had to do with the management changes. It seems like you specifically tied the management shakeup to what you'd called hitting the numbers in sort of internal accountability. And yet, obviously, you're facing some big external headwinds. During the release, you talked about oil prices, ForEx, strong dollar, you still had the cyclical issues in agriculture. Those would seem to be external factors where you're sort of implying that there's internal execution has been the issue and you have to make some changes. Can you just talk about kind of the rationale for the big shakeup and those 2 relative factors?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think you're right. I think we could be pointing at the external factors as being the prime drivers. At the same time is, if you look at Trimble today versus Trimble 5 years ago, in terms of they make up the company, they were significantly more complex equation than we were 5 years ago, much more software content, professional services, different elements. And so I think that we've always had the view is that we have to step up to a new level as a company to basically be able to execute on things like the Beijing job, which requires kind of a level of focus and a level of collaboration in the company that we haven't historically had provided. So I think there's always been the view that we needed to transform. I think just the current situation and the fact that, I guess from my standpoint, I think we need to be a bit more intimate with the market than maybe we've demonstrated here in the last 2, 3 quarters. I think maybe we should be a little bit more -- we should have seen some of the ag stuff coming. We should have seen elements of this oil and gas thing coming. So I think that it's a good time to accelerate things, accelerate the strategic moves into the present. So I think that part of that is the world may not provide us -- do us any favors here in the next few years. I think at some point that we execute whatever the conditions that we see. So I think we're getting the opportunity to make sure that we're ready for whatever the world shows us here in the next few years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Can I get one clarification because you said something in the end which struck me as funny? Francois, you said you are assuming the R&D tax credit is being reinstated. Does that give you at about 1% lower tax rate? Is that the magnitude that you...
Francois Delepine: Yes, roughly. That's roughly right.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, just want to make sure I understood that. First, can we talk about the profitability of Field Solutions? I don't have any problem with your forecast, really, in ag and you're doing a fine job. I guess I was impressed by the profitability in the first quarter of Field Solutions with the weak volume, that you sort of reestablished sort of almost a baseline kind of profitability. Do you have some idea where that's coming from and with the new products, that if indeed you hold the improvement and outperformance that you expect in the second half that those margin can actually course back up to the 40% level?
Francois Delepine: Yes. I mean, we saw strong gross margins pretty much in line with last year. And also we worked in reducing expenses a little bit, and the run rate is a result of the drops in -- drop in revenue. Other than that, yes, we had some new products coming in Q1. Some of those were associated with a small price increase that I think helped maintain those gross margins. But yes, there's no other big factor that I'd point to.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Yes. And if indeed you can get the volume that you're looking for towards the second half of the year, do some -- your focus is restoring the profitability back to historic levels in that business?
Francois Delepine: I think in Field Solutions, we're at the 35% kind of operating income level, and I think that's -- we were -- we felt like it's a good level. So certainly, we want to maintain that. We want to staying north of 30. But not sure we plan to go back to the high 30s or 40% level that we once had.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And can you give us some magnitude about your agreement with Paccar and what that could mean? You talked about 7 figures when you talking about Beijing. Because I assume the Paccar deal has 2 parts to it, which is the hardware installation going on and then there's the software package that can go with it. Can you give us some idea what the top line and bottom line impact would be from that project? Is it a couple -- several million dollars in the quarter is what we're looking at? Or can you give us some idea what it is?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so let me characterize it broadly. Again, I don't want to share Paccar's business with the world. So I think the expectation is tens of thousands or significant tens of thousands of units of subscribers with the possibility of more. And then there is a recurring piece there, let's call it, a respectable ARPU. And again, our strategy would be to upsell and, okay, increase the ARPU. So that's about the best I can do, Eli.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, but there is a -- there would be hardware component installation. That will be direct revenue, right?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Can you give us a little bit more color, the profitability shortfall at E&C were sort of more dramatic than I think anybody expected, and I know weather and all those other things. We are looking at positive trends in nonres construction at this point that have accelerated, if anything, as you went through March as most of the companies had tough January and February, but very strong March in a lot of the areas that I look at, I would say. Are we looking at just natural business being able to drive the profitability back towards more normal level? Or is the restructuring in better business outside the U.S. really the crux of the matter?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. I mean, within E&C, kind of profitability story there, again a number of moving parts. Part of this is this geospatial impact of revenue dropping out with relatively high gross margins. There are the acquisition effects, which will -- some of them will pass with the time where the acquisitions of the latter part of 2014 are dragging down profitability, that once we get kind of the revenue recognition accounting straight out there will be some natural adjustment there. And yes, so I would say if I were to point fingers, I would point the fingers at kind of the volume effects mostly from geospatial, and then this acquisition accounting FX is kind of being kind of the thing affecting the historical trends.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Can you get back to your targeted second half metric with added recovery in geospatial?
Steven W. Berglund: No. I think that, hopefully, I was relatively specific on that in the script is that, until we get this figured out in terms of the secondary effects, which are kind of our outside of our immediate perception. We're being pretty conservative on geospatial. So I would say is, there is a conservative geospatial element in what I said about the second half if it -- we return to normal, it turns out to be inventory effects that reverse up fairly quickly, that will be net upside.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Netzel from Dougherty & Company.
Andy Netzel: I'm dialed in on behalf of Andrea James. So you've obviously done a great job assembling a BIM suite that nobody else has. What's your pipeline on that? And are you seeing any inflection point in the growth?
Francois Delepine: Yes, so I think the pipeline, it's lots of engagement. I think that -- to be a little careful on just not to give kind of early, too early of an optimistic sense, I think, okay, again, we're engaging at the big project level or we're engaging at the enterprise level. So we're talking about kind of in terms of the big story we're impacting the work process of large enterprises or the potential large projects. So there is a time function here. So I believe that, strategically, we're at an inflection point because I think the recognition is by large contractors, in the case of Beijing, in terms of large owners to -- there's an understanding that they need to engage the technology. So I think we are at a strategic inflection point. Am I -- can I make a call that, okay, a third quarter, fourth quarter that sort of thing? I don't think so, but I think there is a -- it should be a meaningful part of the story certainly during 2016. And Beijing, the fact that we were able to make the Beijing win public, I think the reference value of that is huge. It's an endorsement of the first magnitude.
Andy Netzel: Great. And just one more, I know predicting what Congress is going to do is kind of a fool's errand, but I want to throw it out there anyway. Do you have any color on the Highway Bill?
Steven W. Berglund: I'm waiting. Not really, I think they're kind of caught up in other things at the moment. But for the moment, we're just waiting to see what happens.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay, thanks for attending. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Francois Delepine: Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund: Thanks, everybody.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-10 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Jim Todd - Director Investor Relations Steven Berglund - CEO Francois Delepine - CFO
Analysts: Mark Strauss - JP Morgan Jonathan Ho - William Blair Rob mason - Robert W. Baird Ian Ing - MKM Partners Andrea James - Dougherty Kristin - Needham & Company Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Jim Todd, you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd: Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Francois Delepine, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the Company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release which is available along with additional financial information, on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now, let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Berglund: Good afternoon. There were four unanticipated elements in the fourth quarter which affected our performance against the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Exchange rates, the oil price decline, and acquisition revenue recognition effects had negative impacts on pre-tax results, while a catch-up adjustment to our annual tax rate had a favorable effect on the quarterly tax rate. Without these effects our reported revenue would have been in the middle of our guidance range. The major themes of this afternoon will be the fourth quarter is not a reliable predictor of performance. I will let Francois for explain the moving parts in the quarter. I will focus on total year 2014 results which provide a more useful contacts for 2015. The exchange rate, oil price and revenue recognition factors we encountered in the fourth quarter will have a negative impact on performance in the first half of 2015. Agriculture remains a negative factor but we believe our ability to forecast the market is improving. We have yet to prove it conclusively. The business outlooks were progressively improved during 2015 with relatively strong second half with double-digit revenue growth postponed until then. The major risk to this improving outlook is the economies outside U.S. which in some cases are less than robust and potentially disappointing As far as core result, 2014 was a stronger year than the reported results may indicate. Although total revenue growth was 5% the company excluding Field Solutions was up 9% for the year but most of that being organic. The other dynamic, agriculture induced bad news, good news effect is the rapidly decreasing reliance in agriculture margins. Over the last two years since 2012, total company non-GAAP operating income has increased by 21% despite the significant negative effects of a 25% decline in operating income in the highly profitable Field Solutions segment. This growth results from the rest of the company excluding Field Solutions growing non-GAAP operating income from 2012 to 2014 by over 60%. As a result, the contribution of non-GAAP operating income by Field Solutions has dropped from 47% of total company in 2012 to 29% in 2014 in unattended consequence of the agriculture malaise has been a more balanced portfolio and a more balanced story that becomes easier to manage. Last quarter, we laid out a scenario whereby Trimble could grow double-digits in 2015 while the operational basis for that scenario is still intact, the combination of effects which surfaced late in the year will take away enough growth points to make that more difficult in the first part of 2015. Let me speak to these effects. The first is oil prices. Trimble has a relatively de minimis direct exposure to the decline in oil prices, approximately 1% of revenue or about $25 million a year, mostly on sales and exploration activities which has been drastically curtailed. We saw an immediate revenue impact of $5 million-$6 billion in the fourth quarter across E&C and Field Solutions. Our preliminary judgment is that we will see a continuing impact at this level and that our growth rate will be impacted by about one percentage point a quarter for the first two to three quarters of 2015. There may be secondary effects that could be both negative and positive. The most significant positive effect would be of lower gasoline prices provide cover to Congress to pass an infrastructure bill founded by an increase in gasoline taxes. One could also speculate that lower energy prices will provide some relief to struggling economies around the world and lead to improvements in those economies later in the year. On the other hand oil, producing countries could see a pullback in spending. The second effect is a stronger dollar which is a more significant consideration for us. Translation effects will negatively affect revenue growth for the first three quarters of 2015 by three to four points of growth assuming current exchange rates. The bottom line effects will be less impactful since our cost profile gives us close to a natural profit hedge under most scenarios. The third effect from fourth quarter is new acquisitions and the accounting for them. New acquisitions represented a short-term drag on revenue and earnings during 2014 partly because of the deferred revenue accounting effects. The most significant of these effects in the fourth quarter was Manhattan Software which from a business perspective is on track with pre-acquisition expectations although the revenue accounting has not yet reflecting the upside. Manhattan Software and the other acquisitions temporarily depressed non-GAAP operating margin by four points for 2014. We expect these revenue have recognition effects Manhattan Software to continue to be a drag on E&C operating margins through the first half of 2015 and then to provide lift in the second half as it starts to reverse. Let me update you on the latest picture by segment. Reported E&C revenue was up 10% for 2014. The growth was affected late in the year by the effects of the oil price decrease, exchange-rate effects and the larger order in the fourth quarter of 2013. Also, late in the year, we saw within E&C some of the anticipated cautiousness in Europe we identified in the last quarterly call. The combination of these effects will place pressure on revenue growth rates in the first half of 2015. We generally see strong double-digit growth in the construction product lines in the U.S. competitively inconsistent performance in Europe and a range of performance in other parts of the world.  We currently anticipate the second half of the E&C in 2015 to be stronger than the first half. Part of this is the relief on comps as we lapped the exchange-rate and oil prices affects; part as the reversal of the adverse revenue accounting, part of it is the current view on order pipeline and part of it is the flow of new product launches during the course of the year. Field Solutions revenue was down for the year by 11%. Agriculture is the dominant part of the story and was obviously down more. The agricultural market is adapting to change circumstances and we are working to understand how the larger effects impact us. As an example, corn cash proceeds dropped by approximately 20% in 2014 as a result of price declines of 35% which were partially offset by higher yields. This trend is expected to continue in 2015 with the resulting drop in corn acres planted at least in the US. Soybean acres increased in 2014 with an expected drop in soybean cash crop proceeds in 2015. With major swings like this occurring, it is difficult to capture significant mindshare from farmers to discuss ROI. Our formulation for agriculture in 2015 is still roughly the same as the one we provided last quarter, which assumes our base agricultural market will retreat by another 15% year-to-year and will be partially offset by irrigation sales, new products and services. As the OEM anomalies which impacted us severely in the third and fourth quarters, worked themselves out, we also anticipated our forecasting ability to improve since we will be less reliant on another players. Although we can't allow ourselves to feel comfortable, our profile through the first five weeks of the current quarter is generally consistent with this scenario. Finally, although the second half of the year is a long way off, the OEM driven relative meltdown in the second half of 2014 we provide easier comps in the second half of 2015 which may improve relative growth performance. Reported Mobile Solutions 2014 revenue was up 5% and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 16%. The core elements of the segment built around transportation and logistics grew double digits and generated close to 20% non-GAAP operating margins. The two primary elements within the segment that resulted in the lower performance where Field Services which we discussed last quarter and construction supply. Construction supply is currently expected to benefit from new product introductions in the improved U.S. construction market and should demonstrate better performance as 2015 progresses. Field services is more reliant in enterprise accounts of longer sales cycles. We do however expect improvement on revenue growth and profitability during the year which is supported by both the potential orders pipeline and expected new products which will allow us to access new market segments. The decline in oil prices will probably be a net plus in the segment. On the one hand it could relax some of the pressure that reduce cost through our Solutions, on the other hand it will relieve some of the intense financial pressure felt by the participants and what is typically a low margin transportation and logistics market and give them increased discretion to invest in the business. Our 2014 performance across the regions was variable. In general, North America performed well outside the agriculture and is expected to continue and do well in 2015. Brazil was adversely affected by agriculture but has strong double-digit growth in E&C. the current direction of the Brazilian economy in 2015 is unclear and we are remaining flexible.  China has strong double-digit growth overall and if the Chinese economy remains in its current state, it should continue to provide us with growth opportunities. India reflected double-digit growth in 2014 and is currently experiencing new momentum although it may take some time to play out for us. Russia was down precipitously in 2014 but most of the effect in E&C and we are assuming the market remains difficult in 2015. The Middle East and parts of the Africa showed extremely strong growth in 2014 with generally strong expectations for 2015.  Europe is the most significant concern in 2015 aside from the exchange rate effects which will have a significant effect on translated dollar revenue. Although our European results for 2014 outside of Field Solutions reflected growth, we are seeing increased caution in Germany and making investments and cannot yet assess the full meaning for 2015. Our financial model has been squeezed by the relatively precipitous drop in agriculture which resulted in a slight drop in non-GAAP operating margin to 20% of revenue for 2014. Field Solutions operating margins have fallen six points in the two years from 2012 to 2014 while the rest of the company excluding Field Solutions has improved by about 3.5 points over that time, leading to a 20% increase in dollar operating income over the last two years. We continue to balance the cyclical short-term pressures with the longer-term secular view that agriculture has substantial future growth available in data and information solutions. Our approach thus far has been to mitigate cost as opposed to engaging in significant cost reduction to maintain the historical agricultural operating margins. Our stake in the ground is that we will maintain agricultural operating margins at greater than 30% against all foreseeable revenue scenarios which is down from traditional peak values. The overall Field Solutions segment operating margin may move around some depending on the revenue mix within the segment. We currently expect to expand operating margins for the total year largely on the back of the second half improvements. I have identified the most significant current portfolio issues within Trimble agriculture, our owners business which includes Manhattan Software, Construction Supply and Field Services Management. We believe all of these are grow up businesses and add to the Trimble franchise and expect to see all of them demonstrate a meaningful progress in 2015. Buried deeper within the portfolio are a number of smaller niche businesses that are not material. Some of them are profitable historical legacies and some are nascent growth platforms. We continue to evaluate all of our business elements and re-justify them on strategic fit and ability to conform to our financial expectations with an eye to tuning the portfolio. We expect 2015 to be a rich year for new products, some of which will be market extenders or penetrators. Trimble Leap and the R1 GNSS receiver will both fall in that category. They are both bring your own device solutions which have the potential to democratize and grow a number of Trimble’s existing 2 markets. They are combination of a low-cost, high accuracy, GNSS receiver, and Trimble software that pairs directly with smartphones and tablets. High accuracy is achieved with real-time corrections from Trimble's viewpoint RTX correction service. Potential users include an expanded universe of GIS users as well as existing the new users and construction land administration. Finally, let me comment on the ongoing process of renewing our Board of Directors to provide the experience and skills to address our opportunities. I am pleased to announce that Börje Ekholm, has agreed to join the Trimble board and will stand for election to the Board at our Annual Shareholders Meeting in May. Börje has served as President of CEO of Investor AB since 2005 and also currently serves as Chairman of the Board Of NASDAQ OMX. He is Chair of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the director of Ericsson. Following election, his term as a Trimble Director will commence upon stepping down from his officer and director positions at Investor AB effective May 12, 2015.  He brings a rich international experience that with exposure to a wide range of industries. We anticipate a major contribution both in supporting and advising management and meeting the challenges of future growth as well as providing insight into the market possibilities across a number of vertical markets.  Let me turn the call over to Francois.
Francois Delepine: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Before getting to the numbers, please note that unless otherwise indicated, the operating results I will discuss will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is in our earnings press release along with the financial data by segment. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. So now let's first, the fourth quarter results and then move on to the full-year 2014. Q4 total revenue was $564 million, down 6% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter revenue was challenging, which we expected. This was due to weakness in the agriculture business, the year-on-year comparison challenge due to the one-time effects in Q4 '13 in the engineering and construction segments and the impact of the 14th week in Q4 2013. Currency translation add an approximately 2% year-over-year unfavorable effect offset by acquisitions adding approximately 2% year-over-year.  In the end, our results were towards the low end of our range due to the following: we were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the dollar during the quarter, recent acquisition at strong billings but less revenue recognized than the expected within the quarter, and lastly we saw short-term reaction in our oil and gas vertical to the decline in oil prices. Upside of agriculture, excluding the E&C one-time effects, and adjusting for currency impacts, organic revenue in Q4 was up approximately 5%.  Now looking at revenue by segments: Engineering and construction segment revenue was down 1% this is essentially due to the one-time effects from Q4 ’13 excluding those the underlying organic growth for E&C is up in the high single digits driven by growth in heavy civil and building construction. Our Q4 guidance comments included that E&C revenue in Q4 ’13 benefited from the revenue recognition of the large discreet item and also included revenue from the virtual site joint venture which is now deconsolidated. These are known impacted fourth quarter growth negatively by approximately 8%. Currency headwinds were approximately 3% and favorable to year-over-year growth roughly offset by the acquisitions in E&C. Field Solution segment revenue was down 27% year-over-year due to weakness in the agricultural business which was down over 30% compared to Q4 ’13 during which agriculture had grown by double digits. The agriculture weakness was widespread and most pronounced in OEM factory installed. Currency translation add an approximate 2% unfavorable year-over-year impact on the Field Solution segment. Mobile Solutions segment revenue was down 1% year-over-year, as in the recent quarters, this was a mix picture with the growth in transportation and logistics, and a year-over-year decline in Field Services Management. The segment results were also modestly impacted by the divestiture of a nonstrategic consumer oriented business. Currency translation at the smaller 1% unfavorable effect on a year-over-year growth as this business is less geographically diversified. Advanced Devices was down 2% in the fourth quarter. By geography 53% of the Q4 revenue was from North America, 24% from Europe, 15% from Asia-Pacific, and 8% from rest of the world. North America was down 9% year-over-year but excluding the impact of one-time items we discussed, North America would have been roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. North America was where the agriculture decline was most pronounced. Europe was down 6% year-over-year, primarily impacted by currency and weakness in agriculture along with general softness in some key markets like Germany. Russia also continue to be down significantly. Adjusting for currency impacts, Europe would have been up by close to 2% on a year-over-year basis in Q4. Asia-Pacific was up 5% year-over-year. Within Asia-Pacific, there were multiple bright spots including China and India. Australia improved from prior quarters and was up slightly. Rest of the world was flat year-over-year as the Middle East and Africa posted strong results offset by weakness in South America primarily due to agriculture. Non-GAAP gross margins decreased to 56% in fourth quarter compared to 57% in the fourth quarter 2013, due mainly to reduce agriculture sales and associated lower gross margins in the Field Solutions segment. Q4 non-GAAP operating income was $84.2 million or 14.9% of revenue as compared to 20.9% of revenue in the prior year. Many of our businesses showed operating income improvements but the total company results were negatively impacted by a number of factors. Breaking these down and approximately speaking, we saw unfavorable operating margin effects from lower revenue in agriculture for two points, acquisition for another two points, the biennial dimensions users conference for one point, and profit from the discrete item recognized in Q4 ’13 for one point. The impact on currency translation on company margin was small. While our revenue was impacted, we have a significant cost base in Europe and other countries which mitigates the impact on the operating income. As Steve mentioned, our acquisitions of performing to business expectations but our financial results have been impacted by revenue accounting. This is occurring in two ways. First, GAAP accounting mandates or purchase accounting fair value balance sheet adjustment that often significantly reduces the pre-acquisition deferred revenue. Since most of that impacts short-term deferred revenue, the revenue shortfall diminishes over time and is mostly in the first two to three quarters. Secondly some businesses were acquired particularly those with software and professional services offerings, our business practices that need to be adjusted to meet the revenue recognition threshold in a public company such as Trimble. We are recognizing very little revenue in the short-term while carrying the full operating expenses, hence a negative impact from profitability. We are working to mitigate these short-term effects and while we still expect dilutive impact in the first half of the year, we expect that the acquisitions that we close in the second half of 2014 would be accretive in the second half of 2015. The non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter 2014 was 5%. The full-year rate was 19% as compared to a prior year 22% estimate due to geographic mix of income and the R&D tax credit which was re-enacted in Q4. The Q4 rate reflected a catch-up for the full-year on these items. Q4 net income of $76 million was down 33% as compared to Q4 ’13. Diluted earnings per share were $0.29 compared to $0.43 in Q4 ’13. Let me now provide a summary of the 2014 full-year results which Steve have already commented on in more detail. Total revenue was $2.4 billion and up 5% over 2013 excluding the agricultural business, total company revenue was up approximately 9% for the full-year. Engineering and construction was up 10% year-over-year driven by growth in Trimble buildings, heavy civil and geospatial. Field Solutions was down 11% with agriculture down double-digits partially offset by growth in GIS revenue. Mobile Solutions grew 5% for the year with double-digit growth from the transportation and logistics business partially offset by declines in Field Services Management. The Advanced Devices segment was up 9%. By geography for the year, 54% revenue came from North America, 24% from Europe, 14% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from the rest of the world. The year-over-year North America was up 2%, Europe was up 9%, Asia Pacific was up 9%, and rest of the world was up 7%. Non-GAAP gross margin reached a full year record level of 57.5%, up one point year-over-year primarily reflecting the impact of a more favorable mix of revenue. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1% to $480 million or 20% revenue as compared to 20.7% revenue in 2013. Note that, without the negative impact of agriculture and the negative short-term effects of acquisitions, operating margin percentage would also have been up on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate for full-year 2014 was 19%. 2014 net income of 387 million was down 6% as compared to 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $1.46 compared with $1.58 in 2013. Turning to the balance sheet; we finished the fourth quarter of 2014 with $148 million in cash. Accounts receivable was $362 million with days sales outstanding of 58 days, and ending inventory was $278 million. Deferred revenue increased to a record level of 238 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year. The larger increase in deferred revenue primarily reflect changes in the mix of our revenue towards both software and subscription offerings and include the impact of acquisitions. We are pleased to complete refinancing of the company's debt in the fourth quarter primarily through our initial public debt offering during which we issued $400 million of investment grade senior notes due in 2024. This extends the term for a portion of our total debts that we believe to be long-term in nature. Debt increased by $92 million in the fourth quarter 2014 ending at $738 million versus $647 million at the end of third quarter 2014 primarily due to acquisition activity. Our debt-to-equity ratio and leverage ratio which is gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA remain at comfortable levels in the quarter at 0.31 and 1.4 X respectively. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of Trimble common stock for a total of $32.8 million. For the full year 2014, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for a total of $97.8 million. We have $250 million remaining on our share buyback authorization. For the full-year, cash flow from operating activities was $407 million, down 2% against 2013. Lastly, I am pleased to report that the litigation reserve that impacting our GAAP results in Q3 related to $51 million jury verdict against the company has been reversed in the fourth quarter as the initial verdict was overturned. This impact was excluded from our non-GAAP results. I will now turn to our guidance for Q1 2015. We expect first quarter revenue to be between $590 million and $620 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.33, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.09 to $0.16. Revenue guidance includes level of conditionality. We have a higher level of confidence in our forecast for the company outside of agriculture and within agriculture we expect another double-digit year-over-year decline in a higher level of variability. First quarter non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $41 million related to prior acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $4 million, and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of $13 million. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assumes approximately 264 million shares outstanding and the 22% non-GAAP tax rates. This non-GAAP tax rate assumes that the R&D tax credit will be re-enacted for 2015.Note that we're abating our non-GAAP tax rate methodology moving forward to eliminate the big quarterly variations associated with up and down troughs during the year.  With that we will now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Koster with JP Morgan, your line is open.
Mark Strauss: This is Mark Strauss, thanks for taking our questions. So, I guess starting with Field Solutions, I understand it's still early in the season for Ag but can you just talk about the demand you're seeing for some of the new products and thinking more specifically for the irrigation products and I guess this -- I know you don't guide by segment, but does the total guidance of 590 to 620 include a material impact from that? Or do you think, more meaningful to 2Q.
Steven Berglund: Again, as I said in the scripted portion, so far through the quarter we are on a profile that we have laid out -- well with the profile that we actually laid out back in last quarterly call. So I think it's too early to be at all categorical but the relative impact of irrigation -- part of it is action on our part. This is going to be a combination of direct and indirect distribution. We, in the last few months have shown significant progress in terms of putting direct salespeople in place so a growing portion of the geography is covered by direct salespeople which should have a beneficial impact. I think again it is a seasonal market and I think that March for latter stages of February and March are going to be the significant periods. So I think it's premature to talk specifically about irrigation. But again through five weeks of the quarter we are on the profile that we laid out, so there is some reassurance that we are getting -- and there are understanding of current market conditions is improving and that we are less subject to -- let's call it drastic unforeseen movement. So I think still guarded, but I think our level of controlling insight is improving. But beyond that I think we need to wait until we are little deeper in the quarter to kind of characterize where we are on this quarter.
Mark Strauss: Okay, thanks Steve. And Francois, are there any general guidelines you can give for FX, maybe just walk through your top one or two currency exposures, and just say is there anything like 5% decline, and the euro would be a x% decline in your annual revenues, kind of guidelines.
Francois Delepine: Yes, so let me just kind of give you some general trends, I mean clearly we have about a third of our revenue in non-US dollar and out of that the largest number by far is in Euro, so that should kind of help you little bit and just kind of the rates that we assumed for the Euro is 116 which is -- it's a little bit worse today, right. It's been a little bit -- but I think we are in the range, that's what we have assumed for the guidance.
Mark Strauss: Okay, thank you. That's it for us. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair, your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Just wanted to start out with the guidance for 2015 and some of the comments you had on the second half of the year. I just wanted to know and I know you have outlined a few items but what gives you sort of confidence that the organic growth is going to get back to sort of your prior targets and overall revenue growth back to double-digits in that second half. And can you maybe rank order for us some of the items that you listed previously in terms of that importance?
Steven Berglund: Yes, so part of this is, I guess the fundamental question, which is more indicative the fourth quarter or the three quarters through September 2014. If you exclude Field Solutions, by my calculations so you want to double check this but by my calculation that year-over-year growth through the first nine months of the year for the company excluding Field Solutions was between 12% and 13%. So I think that going into the fourth quarter, we had baseline for the company excluding Field Solutions admittedly of 12% to 13% which was overwhelmingly organic. Now, the math that we laid out in the last quarterly call was for comparatively modest organic growth, actually less than -- I think we had shown earlier in 2014, plus the effect of the acquisitions. So I think the calculation related to 2015 and the of the exchange rates -- the combined effects of the exchange rates, oil and gas and these revenue accounting effects has put definite pressure on the first half of the year. But I think our calculation of the last quarter which was, let's call organic growth at levels that we had demonstrated or more than demonstrated in the past, plus the inorganic giving rise to the view that a double-digit number was possible, I think that certainly applies to the second half when the comps start to get easier. Plus, I think there is a view from an organic perspective that in terms of looking at the pipeline of activity that some of our businesses are reflecting, it's actually there are some quite positive trends, now these tends to be larger blocks of businesses, some of them will happen some of them won't happen, but we are likely to see some relatively significant pieces of business in the second half for the year that are currently in a pipeline of prospective business. So I think that we still feel good about the fundamental platform businesses excluding agriculture and agriculture is the current assumptions the one we laid out which is down baseline down 15% with some mobility to mitigate of that. But I think we feel good about the base business, I think the only qualification or that would be new in the last three months maybe a little but more intensity around, what is going on in Europe and what's going to be the economic fallout in Europe, but parts of Europe are quite strong such as the UK but looking at Germany, I think there is a kind of undertone of consciousness and conservatism in Germany that would be work potentially impact us as we go through 2015 but generally we are in a solid position strategically. We have a strong and in some cases growing momentum in our businesses and from an operational standpoint and from a strategic standpoint, we actually feel good about it once we qualified for agriculture and the possibility that Europe could turn out late during the course of the year. Some of it is just the math of revenue recognition and kind of year-to-year comps but I think beyond that there is some relatively strong kind of organic movement within the company.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. Thank you, that's very helpful and this is a follow-up, I mean given what we saw happen with your OEM relationship in the fourth quarter, I know this is difficult to predict but have we seen sort of last time that that's going to happen, has there been some sort of change or correction in terms of inventory levels or production type trend that give you more confidence that you may be OEM partners still run their business more like auto companies or sort of whole production in the fourth quarter of ’15 any commentary there in terms of what may be gives you some more confidence that won’t recur?
Steven Berglund: Well, attempting to be balance here, one the on hand, I think what we saw in the third and fourth quarter was just the OEM standing on the breaks and given the complexity of their supply chain, they really have to hit the brakes really hard to get an effect. We have been something fairly close to just-in-time supplier when it came to supplying the factories. I think in a general senses, there is a whole lot of inventory left there to create an inventory effect. At the same time, I think that it’s fair to look in the direction of the OEMs because it's impossible to kind of predict behavior of complex organizations and I think it’s the appropriate question to ask but I think that I don't want to give any guarantees but I think that the bulk of the OEM questions behind us and then what we are really looking at now is okay what is the honest-to-goodness demand, the sell through demand of the marketplace is going to be, is going to be the clear driver from this point on, but again I don't want to give in, given that other people are involved, I don’t want to give an absolute sort of guarantee that it's done, but I think it is.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray and your line is open.
Brett Wong: Thanks guys, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you can frame up a little bit more of the impact in E&C with the little lower energy prices and obviously you since talked about the direct impact but more on that indirect impact.
Steven Berglund: So the direct impact I think we have seen it and we have traditionally sold between $20 million and $30 million into oil exploration and that’s a very quick reaction sort of market. So I think we saw the effect in the fourth quarter and it has been drastic and it has probably purged kind of zero in terms of that as being a marketplace for us for some here. If both turns out very quickly and then starts up very quickly. So if we have to rebound, what we are good with, what we would see presumably is a cliff function going in the other direction as far as the indirect effects, I think those will play out over time but it would be things like and may not even be detectable in the background clutter, it would be things like if at some point somebody were going to build a road into an oil exploration area that road may not be built but I don't think we wouldn't actually, may be in couple of cases we could but it will be demand we never knew was going to be there in the first place. So, I think there will be indirect effects, so I think it would be silly not to say that there are indirect effect, I don't think that they will be particularly easy to categorize or all that necessarily notable. I think that if it the indirect effects would okay, how would it effect national economies? And okay is there an effect that rolls through from us in terms of investment levels and such like that but I think by and large the parts of the industry that are going to be affected will be comparatively small for us, okay obviously, but most obviously be a construction related to oil and that has never been a particular point of focus for us. It has been for others in the industry's other competitors I think will be affected more directly by kind of the fall off and construction related to oil but that has never been a particular point of focus for us historically. So, there will be effects, I just don’t expect them to be particularly notable and it will tend to be kind of background effects and probably not even identifiable by us.
Brett Wong: Thanks, Steve. Can you talk a little bit more just on expectations for longer-term highway bill, obviously that's going to be impactful here as we move into the second half. So, just any color you can provide there what you see now and obviously it makes sense that it would go through at this point with lower energy prices.
Steven Berglund: So, I think that -- I don't have any particular insight in terms what's happening in Washington. I think that if you were to look at the single, most positive discrete event that could occur for Trimble. I think it would be a highway bill with multiyear financing but probably would be the most significant discrete and was positive event that could happen to Trimble because it could reignite, I think a level of confidence, it would provide increased confidence that there would be multiple years of funding and that has resolved contractors which would rev up to make the investments necessary to be competitive and securing that funding. So, I think it would be highly notable if the highway bill, with multiple years twenty funding were to pass. Now, I think that it is reasonably encouraging, although I am not one to be able to judge particularly well. I think it is somewhat encouraging that there seems to be bipartisan discussion going on and that there seems to be a somewhat of a bipartisan view that okay gasoline taxes would be the way to fund it, I don't think that conversation was being held on a bipartisan basis as of and maybe even a year ago but certainly not two years ago. So I think that's encouraging. What the timetable is? I don't know but it is one of the few things that Congress might be able to pass in a spirit of bipartisanship. So a vague hopes on my part, it would be a significant for Trimble if that happens but I don't know what probabilities are and I don't know what time framework is.
Brett Wong: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes in one Rob mason with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Rob mason: Good afternoon, Steve, Francois. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in a second on the E&C margins, I think I understand the impact of the differed revenue accounting but is that all it’s going on there because it was pretty significant drop-off and I am not sure I can account for all of that margin degradation via that.
Francois Delepine: Yes, so there is one more element which the discreet revenue item that was recognized in Q4 ’13. So on a year-on-year basis, that's definitely has an impact. We also have dimensions which is probably $2 million to $3 million for just that E&C business alone, for the total company about $5 million. So those would be the two other things that I would point to decides the acquisition and as a matter of fact may have a bit more impact on the E&C it does on the total company in terms of operating margin.
Steven Berglund: Just, may be adding on here a little bit is, I think that if just the discrete, -- in effect if you play portfolio here a little bit and what we call our owner 's business focus on the owners of the project, which is where Manhattan software is, where the bulk of the stuff is occurring. We just took that out, the rest of E&C without the owner 's business. The operating margins for the fourth quarter 2014 would look pretty similar to what they look like in the fourth quarter 2013 without any exchange rates. So plain portfolio, relatively comfortable that okay we have got hard handle on E&C margins and what we have here is a bit of a portfolio issue to work through.
Francois Delepine: Yes, it would've flat and without the outliers and the acquisitions.
Rob mason: Okay. And Steve you reference this, I call it 30% or better stake in the ground and fueled solutions, would you expect that you could see that, return to that in the second half of ’15 based on your revenue expectations and does that give you the latitude to invest that you need to you fully see that's connected form solution come to market with the right channel.
Steven Berglund: Yes, I think so, I mean we were currently running in the 30s and so what I did today to provide comfort to the financial community that we weren’t simply going to watch Ag margins or for that matter Field Solutions margins have laid a way is okay, there is what I would call hard floor under margins for Ag and we will simply not let them fall below that. Now with what we see in terms of revenue profile, we do believe that okay even maintaining Ag margins in the 30s as oppose to maybe thinking about a number in the 40s for the time being. I think that leaves us with the discretion to continue to do what we need to do in terms of the connected farm, in terms of the data and information products and I think what you're saying part of the back and early part of 2015 is a product flow that's consistent with this. So I think that we are attempting to find the right balance short-term, long-term but what we attempt to do the day was provide some comfort that we believe we can actually do both.
Rob mason: Okay and did you give an update or maybe I missed it just within Ag, the growth within the aftermarket channel how that compared to be the OEM channel, was it still similar to the third-quarter levels, or did that...
Steven Berglund: I don’t think we have provided much in the way of quantification but directionally Francois talk to, it was it was not pretty anywhere but the fourth quarter was particularly difficult in the OEM channels. So I think that the relative performance of the aftermarket is still better than relative performance in OEM and I think we are getting maybe a better handle on long term interest being able to predict the aftermarket element of it.
Rob mason: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is opened.
Ian Ing: Thanks for taking my questions. As far as we could tell, there was elevated equipment purchases at the end of the year due to section 179 and bonus depreciation loss, so did you see any benefit from that? And do you think customers just bought more in December or did they pull in some of their March purchases into December?
Steven Berglund: Well, answering the second question first. So far given that we are on a profile, on the profile we expect going into the year -- so far there is much evidence from kind of first five weeks of the quarter that there was much in the way of pull in. And again selling largely through a third-party channel, it's hard for me to actually talk to discrete effects. We're not involved with the farmer on each individual transactions going through distribution. So the answer is, there may have been affect, but I don't think it was, from our standpoint it was not particularly discernible. So I think that in terms of a relatively small investment like ours, I'm not sure how much would an effect kind of the tax sort of environment affects us. So if it was there, it wasn't particularly notable to us.
Ian Ing: And obviously a difficult environment in many ways due to several factors, I mean could you highlight the trends that give you the most immunity to some of this, I mean is it the mix to more software and services, more of an annuity, or is it is just tipping point where you talked about contractors just really needing to be more efficient any sort of forces that help offset what's happening right now?
Steven Berglund: Are we talking agriculture, or are we talking in general?
Ian Ing: Just in general, just what should we focus on if that gives you immunity to environments?
Steven Berglund: I mean again I think that immunity might be something that I could only hope for, but I think that again maybe focusing on construction, agriculture gets a lot of attention and the agriculture is what it is and okay we are exposed to kind of a very severe turndown there. So I think that – let me focus a little bit on construction. And I think there both at current status, I think there is also kind of strategic secular play there. But I think that when it comes to construction, Trimble is not selling capacity so whatever is happening in the marketplace in terms of kind of demand or whatever Trimble is selling productivity, it's selling ROI to the contractors. So it's not immunity but let's call it resistance to the downside and maybe putting in the form of if a contractor -- and I don't think we are certainly not, in the U.S. the situation is very robust and in many parts of the world it's still relatively workable economic environment. So I don't want to kind of focus on kind of a negative environment but, in construction let's say a contractor does park half of the fleet out back, the half of the machine fleet out back; Trimble still has the ability to walk through the front door and say okay, we are very sorry that half of your fleet is parked out back because you don't have work for it. But let us help you make the other 50%, the 50% you are using, 20% or 25% or 30% more productive, and we can sell in adverse environment. And I think there is a fundamental, very strong secular trend in construction at this point in time which is -- there are more and more contractors who are willing to state out loud that they can save 25% or 30% of their project cost, their total project cost, through the holistic application of technology. Okay I think that's going to over the next five years, going to just to drive a major secular trend. Those contractors who are relatively early adapters are going to gain such a competitive advantage that it will either force the remaining contractors to step up their game or risk being pushed out of the game. So I think there are some very strong forces that working in construction, exchange rates and all that aside, that don't get the immunity but give us basically I think a strong secular story that let's call it kind of cycle resistant. And we have a very little exposure to mining, so kind of the cyclical downturn in mining really has not been a primary affect on us. So it affects us more through the geospatial thing. Transportation and logistics, I think is totally different paradigm and those tend to be large companies, they have significant balance sheets, I think they make their decisions on a long-term basis and again I don't think there are necessarily cyclical factors that are particularly strong or pervasive there. So I think I still see us as very much of a playing in secular trends even in agriculture. Right now cyclical is very strong but there is a move, there is a technology shift occurring in agriculture and I think that we will be a significant participant in that over the next few years. I'm not sure if I was exactly on point to the question you asked but I guess maybe I'm arguing a little bit with the premise.
Ian Ing: No thanks, I mean that laid out the long-term thesis being intact. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea James with Dougherty, your line is open.
Andrea James: Hi. Most of my questions are already asked so I will just ask two quick ones. What are your thoughts on the construction software solutions you have pulled together? I feel like it's really only recently that you really pulled it all together. So I guess, is there any inflection point coming soon and when you really start to get excited about it throwing off, I guess real fruit?
Steven Berglund: We did roll out at dimensions in November, we did roll out Trimble Connect, which is the fruit of some number of years and a significant amount of investment coined together in one platform that starts to unite all of our construction offerings. So I don't know if there is a magic moment this will be progressive. That's just the opening salvo. There will be new releases coming continuously on that, in every some number of months. But I think that we are seeing the benefit of let's call disintegrated approach on software but it's really in terms of the total Trimble franchise. Again our view, and I will point Ekholm as an example, simply because that has been in press release but the ability for Trimble to come in with a significant portion, if not all of the portion of the technology solution that, yes we will generate the 25% to 30% project savings potentially gives us a, what I will call, significant competitive advantage gives us a significant claim on the share of wallet that's being used for technology acquisition. And so I think that we're already seeing the benefit, maybe not all of it is public at this point in time, a lot of the participants do not want to be press released, but it gives a significant market position. That does result in software revenue sales, but it also pulls the hardware along with it because what we're selling is a bundled solution to a large extent and the software is optimized to work with Trimble hardware even though it would work with anybody's hardware as well. So I think we're already seeing the benefits. I'm not sure that I would want to describe it in terms of some magic moment that creates a real inflection point. I think this is simply every day taking a few more steps ahead sort of market.
Andrea James: Fair enough, and then one more, you talked about the highway bill. I guess, maybe a more minor piece of legislation would be the Railway Safety Act. Can you fill us in there? It's my understanding that every rail operator in North America is going to have to work with you or buy a Trimble survey machine in some way. Can you just bring us up to date and tell us if that is a needle mover at all in the upcoming year?
Steven Berglund: Well, I think I am going to need some more education from you as to exactly what Bill we are talking about. We do have a rail business. It is growing at a very strong double-digit from a small base. And we are talking to our railroads, but I wasn't aware that there was a legislation that was driving some of that. I guess you're going to have to educate me.
Andrea James: Well, maybe it's a safety thing. And then as far as the highway bill obviously you don't have -- all of the commentary that you're giving about the upcoming year, you're not assuming, that hasn’t factored into anything that you said so far, it would be sort of upside to what your communicating right now? Is that the way it was thing about?
Steven Berglund: I'm not going to -- either my personal reputation or the reputation of the company on Washington doing anything. So now it is not considered to be part of it. But I suspect if there were highway bill passed, again particularly in terms of the -- that was relatively clear that had multiple year funding and it was clear that it was going to be used for highway or bridge or infrastructure development, I suspect we would detect the changes in the marketplace within days or weeks. Just for me it would be highly rewarding to those contractors that actually play in the infrastructure market.
Andrea James: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Richard Valera from Needham, your line is open.
Kristin: This is Kristin for Rich Valera. Thanks for let me ask the question. Recently the Department of Transportation announced they expect to publish the final Class A - ELD mandate for the end of 2015. Can you just talk about the opportunities this provides for the Trimble and portion of your Mobile Solutions business?
Steven Berglund: Again, I think I'm going to dodge the question. I'm not necessarily well enough versed to talk about the, let's call it subtle interactions other than to make a probably non-helpful statement that in this realm when it comes to over the road regulation, it is definitely different. Here is a case where regulation creates business for Trimble and much of the regulatory push coming out of DoT, when it comes to over the road and well other forms of transportation as well, requires compliance and that requires technology. So again I'm not well educated enough to be particularly helpful at the moment but I suspect it's probably good news for us.
Kristin: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities, your line is open.
Eli Lustgarten: Good afternoon, everybody. Can I get a couple of clarification to make sure you assumed the R&D credit will be here this year, how much is that lower your tax rate to 22%, because that mean obviously it didn't exist before the end of ’14. Is that a 1% to 2% of [indiscernible] or something like that?
Francois Delepine: Yes, it is built in, and it is a little bit shy, a 1.5% in fact. 
Eli Lustgarten: And secondly, we always ignore it, but you had a hell of a year in Advanced Devices with a 31% drop; is there anything happening that would prevent that from duplicating itself in the years that we're looking for every nickel and dime, so as to make sure that we don't have a blindside there?
Steven Berglund: Yes, I'm going to disappoint you once again, Eli, by not getting enthusiastic. Yes, again I think that every once in a while Advanced Devices will have a -- and this one was driven from a couple of sources. So we have a small military business that actually did very well in 2014, given the kind of budgetary pressures in Pentagon, that's not likely to occur. And then we have a timing business that sells GPS-based timing solutions into the telecom infrastructure players such as Samsung. And that is exceptionally lumpy business, very hard to predict. And I wouldn't necessarily want to predict 2015 as being an up year for that. It could turn out to be that way but there are no indications that is something that we could reliably put in a forecast...
Eli Lustgarten: If then actually we don’t fit in itself?
Steven Berglund: Yes, so I think that the best thing is to assume a very low sort of growth rate for Advanced Devices and not assume that it will repeat again. Basically our internal calculations are not expecting much from it.
Eli Lustgarten: Now as far as -- can you give us what the carryover acquisitions in revenues and how the impact will be in 2015 versus 2014, with the change in deferred revenue? I mean how much revenue -- notably we see in E&C but how much should we account for acquisition growth in the year, that have already been made? 
Francois Delepine: I would say approximately a 3% to 4% would be the rough magnitude, and most of the benefit we will start seeing in the second half as the accounting effects start.
Eli Lustgarten: And most of that’s in the E&C.
Steven Berglund: And most of that is in the E&C, yes.
Eli Lustgarten: And if that if we should we get the change to bring the E&C margin back up to the 20% range that we have seen all the year on a reported basis, and we've got a disappointing quarter under 15 or 16, kind of at which way you look at it. But you know we are going to stay there that while and we got to it at the second half and the acquisition impact the drivers back over 20?
Francois Delepine: Yes, I think, additionally from a runway trend standpoint at the time where we get to second half of the year, total year average, I can't really answer that precisely but, again the E&C margins in Q4, without the acquisition impact and without the applier which has caused, would have been flattish year-on-year. So I think it's what...
Eli Lustgarten: And again, but there is -- I know we didn’t duplicate the fourth quarter of '13, but you're not going to duplicate it in '15 either. You know I have to built that in, I'm just trying to get the scenario with the feel of first half of how the quarters play out and the margins begin to play out and the improvement that we're expecting to take place and E&C is probably most critical area. I am assuming that with the funding running out and the highway bill in the spring also, I assume it will get renewed, but we have all these short-term factors that the second half looks like it should be a much easier and better comparison in E&C than the first half. And I just want to make sure that the right profile to look at.
Steven Berglund: Yes, I think that's a general sense of, that's our general sense.
Eli Lustgarten: And in Mobile Solutions, also I mean you have -- two-part business, one strong, one is not. We had a steady state level of business activity that the modest revenues will be able to sustain the current levels of profitability that we saw for the year in 2014 and 2015?
Steven Berglund: For Mobile?
Eli Lustgarten: In Mobile, yes.
Steven Berglund: Yes, so I think that the real engine within Mobile is the transportational logistics businesses. At this point they are looking at another strong revenue growth year. I am personally expecting that the construction supply which is not a major part of the business but which is enough to kind of at the margins to require a bit of a story here. I think that is now looking at a meaningful growth year. And then I think the Field Services, the other relatively significant part of the segment, the pipeline for the second half of the year is looking pretty strong there. So I think that the general answer to your question is, yes, and I'm hoping for continued improvement and progression there.
Eli Lustgarten: Thank you very much.
Operator: At this time I am not showing no further questions. I'll now turn it back to the company.
A - Steven Berglund: Okay, thank you for attending. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Valerie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jim Todd. Sir, you may begin.
Jim Todd: Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Francois Delepine, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release, which is available, along with additional financial information, on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. The third quarter financials can be described as mediocre against Trimble's standards, with the fourth quarter outlook appearing to be even more disappointing. However, after adjusting for a number of onetime issues, the normalized third and fourth quarter year-to-year trends are more positive than the reported results would indicate. In particular, the baseline third quarter non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of sales improved year-to-year but was depressed by the short-term effects of recent acquisitions. I'll leave it to Francois to explain. The 2 significant changes that caused us to fall out of our revenue guidance for the quarter were a deeper agriculture decline and a step-down in the global economy, particularly in Europe. For example, Russia was down almost 50% year-to-year and Germany also declined. Continuing the pattern of the last year, our business portfolio continues to break down into 2 parts: one comparatively healthy and one that is struggling. The 2 most significant drags in revenue growth are agriculture in the Field Solutions segment and the field services business in the Mobile Solutions segment. The rest of the company, excluding these 2 businesses, has demonstrated convincing year-to-date double-digit organic growth and was in the vicinity of 10% growth for the third quarter despite the heavier economic headwinds. The extent of the decline in agriculture grew in the third quarter and is expected to remain at a depressed level in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter agricultural year-to-year comparison is particularly challenging because we had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter last year, which, in retrospect, was an outlier. We didn't see the latest deterioration coming because the largest cutbacks late in the third quarter and the anticipated cuts in the fourth quarter are coming from equipment manufacturers' distribution channels and from factory fit. This diminished outlook is more severe than the prevailing market and maybe inventory reductions and an amplified overreaction to the market. While the Trimble channel is down, it was down 6% to 7% in the third quarter and may represent clearer market mix signaling. Clearly, our agricultural market forecast model, which has been reliable historically, has broken down under the current extreme conditions. Our current outlook for 2015 for agriculture assumes our base market will retreat by another 15% year-to-year to reflect general industry expectations. However, we believe we have mitigation steps available to improve on the base number. One is better execution in irrigation. We announced our irrigation product line midyear of 2014, and it turns out we were overly optimistic about our ability to execute our distribution strategy before the season ended in the fall. The response to the introduction has been enthusiastic, just not yet monetized. Going into the 2015 early spring season, we now have a growing direct sales force dedicated to irrigation to supplement the dealer channel. With that capability in place, we believe we can add enough revenue in 2015 to mitigate some of the agriculture downside. Another point of mitigation is new product introductions. Historically, there's a tight correlation in our agricultural business between new product introductions and a meaningful lift in revenue. Even with current market conditions, we expect this to remain true. We anticipate a strong season of product introductions in early 2015, and although we're not expecting miracles, we do expect some lift. While we want to avoid overpromising in the short term, the early dynamics on the agricultural services business are encouraging, albeit from a low base. Our target in 2015 is to provide recurring services covering millions of acres during the year. If we execute against this expectation, this could provide some lift from a relatively new revenue source. If we execute on these actions, our tentative net conclusion is that our 2015 agricultural growth performance will be consistent with the first half of 2014, which was down single digits. We have levers to pull and we don't need to be passive victims to the market, but we do have to execute. Because of the high operating margins we have in agriculture, another point to emphasize is the marginal effect of changes in agricultural revenue on aggregate profitability. Agriculture gross margins are in line with the rest of the end-user businesses within Trimble, with the higher agriculture operating margins a function of leverage on the below-the-line expenses. Therefore, at the margin, exchanging $1 of growth in the E&C, our Mobile Solutions segments, for $1 drop in agriculture will leave us more or less indifferent at the total company operating margin line. As a result, with our current aggregated view of 2015, we believe we can continue to improve our total company financial model even if agriculture remains under pressure. Our posture's, therefore, currently one of cost constraint, not major cost restructuring. If the conditions change, we'll adjust accordingly. The other meaningful component of the Field Solutions segment, GIS, continues to grow and is recovering from the challenges in 2013. The picture in the E&C is much brighter. Although our concern about economies outside of the U.S. has grown over the last 3 months, our basic performance is comparatively robust. In the core product categories of our traditional address markets, we believe we are gaining share points worldwide. Strategically, we are also making substantial progress. The last few months have been highly significant in the development of our construction strategy both in acquisitions and product development. The recent acquisitions have reinforced our unique prevalence -- relevance across the entire design-build-operate spectrum, DBO for short. The acquisition of Manhattan Software, which develops facilities management software, provides us with an important bookend. For any given project, our constructible model can now capture the earliest equivalent of a doodle on a napkin, and SketchUp carry that concept into a full 3-dimensional model, which can drive the estimating and scheduling processes and ultimately drive the machines and tools on site. During the construction phase, our constructible model will augment the design data by capturing extensive as-built data. Upon the turnkey event, the constructible model will become accessible as part of the operating model, which is where Manhattan Software enters the picture. Another significant acquisition in the quarter was Gehry Technologies. Aside from the validation of having Frank Gehry select Trimble to be a key part of this long-term legacy, this transaction gives Trimble the ability to accelerate our market strategy. With GT, we've acquired collaboration software, which becomes part of our DBO software platform. As importantly, we acquired a significant high-grade professional services capability. Although we have been organically building professional services capabilities, this provides us a step-function effect and allows us to fill in a significant missing piece of our overall engagement with the DBO market. Owners and contractors are rapidly becoming convinced of the potential of reducing project cost by 25% to 30% with a comprehensive technology solution. A business as usual approach to implementation as a series of point solutions won't achieve the full intended effect. To holistically integrate the various elements requires both deep domain knowledge and technology literacy and will typically require access to professional services. Next week, we are holding Dimensions, our users' group meeting, with over 4,000 attendees. We expect to announce several significant steps that reinforce our position in the market. One of several breakout announcements will be that of Trimble Connect. Trimble Connect is a cloud-based collaboration platform that incorporates GT, which is the software acquired in the transaction with Frank Gehry. It allows all the constituencies in the project, including designers, contractors and owners to share information seamlessly. It will allow the combination of BIM models, conventional CAD models and operational data within one information context. Over the last few years, we have systematically acquired or developed the pieces of the puzzle. The acquisitions have included Tekla, Meridian, Accubid, WinEst, SketchUp, Manhattan and others. When we introduce Trimble Connect next week, we will unify these pieces into an integrated platform that will be continually upgraded going forward. After the first week, we expect to have well in excess of 10,000 signed-up industry users. To the DBO community, this will emphasize Trimble's unique position in 3 ways. First, we cover every information element of the DBO workflow from predesign through operation. Secondly, our product offering is unique because we enable the direct linkage between the data and the tools, machines and operations on the physical construction site through our combination of information, sensors and tools. Thirdly, because of the open architecture of Trimble Connect, we are the leader in democratizing collaboration in the construction process just as we have already democratized modeling and content. The Mobile Solutions segment grew year-to-year. However, the double-digit growth in the transportation and logistics business continues to be held back by year-to-year decline in the field services business. Field services has been challenged by the conversion from our starting horizontal focus on small- and medium-sized businesses to a vertical market focus. Although not yet a large business for us, field services is meaningful as a capability, not just a business, because it supports the entire range of Trimble businesses, including construction and agriculture. In an attempt to clarify our intentions in field services, let me provide a specific example to illustrate what we are undertaking as part of this intensified vertical focus. A major 2015 targeted field services vertical for us is made up of mechanical, electrical and plumbing contractors, a group we are already selling to in E&C. In the U.S., there are approximately 32,000 MEP contractors in the mid-tier category with approximately 360,000 technicians in the field. Assuming a $25 per technician monthly ARPU, this is a U.S. addressable market of over $100 million with the worldwide potential being significantly greater. Currently, there are over 20 competitors, generally small, partially occupying this market, almost all providing no more than dot on a map functionality. We have an opportunity to differentiate ourselves by providing a significantly higher level of functionality and to leverage our channel and brand into a familiar market. Our higher functionality will consist of discrete features such as asset management, work order management and a generally tighter integration into our existing MEP solutions. This is one example of several within our field services vertical market strategy where we believe we can create differentiated advantage. Our general outlook for the company for 2015 needs to be careful, given the forecasting challenges we have in 2014. The first element to consider is the acquisition effect, which provides more of a bump in 2015 than we had in 2014. Including the full year effect of the acquisitions we have already made during 2014 plus probable contributions from the acquisition pipeline we see today, the total acquisition list should be approximately 4 to 6 points of 2015 growth. Establishing the organic foundation for next year is more problematic given the volatility in agriculture and the uncertainty in the direction of the world economy. Looking at 2014 as the base, assuming the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, and making 2 discrete adjustments that Francois will identify later, expected normalize growth -- organic growth to total year 2014 works out to be roughly 5%. Taking 2014 as a template for 2015 and adding the acquisition effect leads to a path to total company growth approximately 9% to 10%. This is hardly a stake in the ground at this point, but it provides a pragmatic context for next year's revenue assuming economic conditions do not deteriorate. In addition, we anticipate delivering our historical underlying levels of operating leverage adjusted for any short-term effects from acquisition accounting. Let me turn the call over to Francois.
Francois Delepine: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Steve mentioned the second half of 2014 is proving more challenging than expected. Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to remind you that unless otherwise noted, the operating results I will discuss will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is available in our earnings press release along with the financial data by segment. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. So let's now discuss the results for the third quarter. Full revenue was $585 million, up 5% year-over-year. We experienced growth in most of our major businesses with the notable exception of agriculture, where the market environment grew significantly more difficult in the quarter. The majority of the growth in the quarter was organic was only a minor impact from acquisitions closed in the past year. Engineering and Construction grew by 10%, with continued growth in Trimble Buildings, heavy civil and geospatial. Field Solutions revenue was down 11% with agriculture revenue down in the mid-teens, offset by growth in GIS revenue. Mobile Solutions grew 7% with continued double-digit growth from the transportation and logistics business and the Advanced Devices segment was essentially flat in the quarter compared to last year. The Q3 revenue by geography was approximately 56% coming from North America, 23% from Europe, 13% from Asia Pacific and 8% from the rest of the world. Total growth rates by region were fairly consistent around the world with 5% in North America, 6% in Europe, 5% in Asia Pacific and 5% in the rest of the world. Relative to the second quarter, however, growth was in line in North America, slowed in Europe and Asia and turned negative in South America. The growth in North America came primarily from Engineering and Construction and Mobile Solutions, offset by a high single-digit decline in Field Solutions linked to agriculture. Europe saw growth in Engineering and Construction, Mobile Solutions and Advanced Devices. However, Field Solutions growth in Europe turned negative in the quarter due to weakness in agriculture and E&C growth slowed. Most countries in Europe grew year-over-year with the exception of Germany and Russia. Germany softened in the quarter, and Russia, as expected, was down significantly for the third quarter in a row. Asia Pacific growth also slowed in the quarter, with mixed performance across the region. Within Asia Pacific, China and India were relatively strong, while Australia remained weak and was down year-over-year. In the rest of the world, the Middle East and South Africa were up significantly year-over-year, but growth in Brazil turned negative due to weakness in agriculture. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the quarter was immaterial. Our gross margin and operating income performance in the quarter was mixed. Q3 gross margin was 57.8%, up about 90 basis points over the third quarter of 2013, driven by continued mix shifts in our portfolio toward the bundled hardware, software, maintenance and subscription services. Third quarter operating income increased 0.2% to $118.4 million or 20.3% of revenue as compared to $118.2 million or 21.2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2013. Third quarter's operating income was negatively impacted by acquisition effects, including the impact of noncash write-downs on preacquisition deferred revenue. Excluding the impact of the short-term acquisition effects, non-GAAP operating income percent was up approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. The effective income tax rate for Q3 was 25%, higher than our expectations due to lower non-U.S. pretax income in the second half of 2014 and compares to 14% in Q3 2013. The increase to 25% for Q3 also includes a catch-up for Q1 and Q2 to bring the year-to-date rate to approximately 22%. Compared to the Q3 '14 tax rates, the Q3 '13 tax rate benefited from discrete tax benefits and the R&D tax credit. Q3 net income was $87 million, which was down 15% as compared to Q3 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $0.39 compared to $0.33 -- sorry, $0.33 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2013. The drop in net income year-over-year is primarily due to the difference in tax rate, which added an approximately $0.05 negative impact to EPS, and the impact of acquisition effects in the quarter, which added approximately $0.03 negative impact to EPS. We finished the third quarter of 2014 with $139 million in cash. We reduced our debt by $9 million ending Q3 2014 with $647 million in debt versus $656 million at the end of Q2 2014. Cash flow from operations was $96 million for Q3 2014 and $310 million for the first 3 quarters of 2014. Cash flow from operations for the first 3 quarters of 2014 was up 12% versus comparable period in 2013. At the end of Q3, accounts receivable was $359 million and days sales outstanding was 56 days as compared to 59 days at the end of Q3 2013. We're pleased with the overall quality of our AR portfolio. Q3 ending inventory was $278 million compared to $274 million at the end of Q2 2014 and $242 million at the end of Q3 2013. Although it did not impact the non-GAAP results, I do want to add a few words about the $52 million reserve for legal matters that we mentioned in the press release and, more specifically, the $51.3 million jury verdict awarded in Alaska to a local entrepreneur claiming it was wronged by Trimble. We strongly disagree with the verdict and the damage award and intend to vigorously seek to have the verdict overturned or failing that, to pursue an appeal. I will now turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect revenue to be between $560 million and $590 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.32. Our guidance reflects the challenging year-over-year comparisons and embeds caution in a number of areas. First, Q4 revenue last year benefited from the revenue recognition of a large discrete item and also include revenue for the VirtualSite joint venture, which is now deconsolidated. Second, we're anticipating the fourth quarter effects to our agriculture revenue that Steve discussed against the difficult double-digit growth comp for the fourth quarter of 2013. We are estimating these combined effects to be approximately $50 million. The fourth quarter guidance, while still disappointing, would show some year-over-year growth after normalizing for these effects. Q4 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assumes approximately 264 million shares outstanding and a 21% to 23% tax rate and also does not assume the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Q4 '14 anticipated tax rate compares to a 10% tax rate in Q4 '13, which, in addition to the U.S. R&D tax credit, also included several discrete tax benefit, including a substantial benefit from a reduction in the finished statutory tax rate. Other elements negatively impacting Q4 '14 EPS guidance compared to Q4 '13 EPS results include the short-term negative impact of recent acquisitions and the expense for our user conference Dimensions in Q4 '14 and the profit associated with the large discrete items, which we had in Q4 '13. Non-GAAP guidance exclude the amortization of intangibles of $39 million related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $4 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $12 million. Now let me say a few words about our capital structure. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2,080,000 shares of Trimble common stock for a total of $65 million. Repurchase activity has continued in the fourth quarter under a 10b5-1 plan, and quarter-to-date, the company has repurchased approximately 1,150,000 shares of Trimble common stock for a total of $33 million. Note that, as I communicated during our capital strategy update at the Investor Day in June, our first priority continues to be to invest in the business to grow organically and through M&A, and we will be opportunistic on share repurchases based on these priorities, market conditions and share price. Finally, concurrent with our earnings release, we filed a generic debt only shelf earlier today. This is to provide Trimble with flexibility on debt-funding options on a go-forward basis, and it is consistent with what we've already communicated in June at our Analyst Day with regards to our financial policy and our long-term capital structure strategy. This quarter, we're holding an investor briefing at our Trimble Dimensions user conference in Las Vegas from November 4, at 12 noon Pacific Standard Time. The briefing will be webcast with access from our Investor Relations website. We will also be participating in the Baird Industrial Conference in Chicago in November 11, and the Wells Fargo Technology Conference in New York on November 12. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to sort of understand this a little bit better. Trimble has historically been able to grow through challenging and cyclical environments. Can you maybe talk about what's caused this to change? And should we view this as being sort of more of a temporary effect? Or do you think there's maybe something more structural or persistent in nature relative to the challenges that you've talked about?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, all right. So this is -- I mean, Trimble has a singular problem at this point in time or a problem of magnitude in agriculture. So I think that taking your question as being a specific question about agriculture, I think it's the relatively extreme nature of the market is, okay, our premise that we've been speaking to kind of for the last 12 months is that we have intended to be cycle-resistant in agriculture. Basically, we're selling productivity, we're not selling capacity, so the farmer may defer the tractor, the farmer may defer the new combine, would certainly defer the new pickup truck. But if we could get to the -- access to the farmer and make the pitch about saving fertilizer or other input cost that we could make the sale kind of in the face of cyclical conditions. So I think what has happened recently, and it took us some time to really understand the full severity of the problem is the farm economy is in deep recession or great recession or whatever, and the farmers have simply gone to the benches and are waiting this one out and really have cut back on their spending. Now we've seen this historically over times where there has been a relatively complete shutdown of buying. Probably the one before this bout was in the latter part of 2008 and into 2009, the Lehman meltdown, which per se did not affect farmers directly, but the headline factor put them on the bench. So I think we're seeing this at this point. Now the third and fourth quarter effects, that the third quarter was worse than we expected. The fourth quarter's also not so good. I think this is simply a second or a third order effect is the Trimble channel, the channel that we ourselves control, that gives us the clearest insight into the market, was down 6% or 7% in the third quarter, roughly consistent with what's transpired year-to-date. It's the channel that we share with the equipment manufacturers and the factory fit market, the OEM market, if you will, in the fourth quarter that are down sharply. So some of that or maybe most of it, in fact, is inventory reduction in kind of the equipment manufacturers' ecosystem. And I think part of it is simply, they've hit the brakes hard, very hard, and I suspect they've overreacted. So I don't think the third or fourth quarter are indicative of what's going on in agriculture. I don't think it's a template for 2015 for sure. I think we return to a normal pattern in 2015. And I think what we're doing at this point in time is painting a conservative -- what we would regard as a conservative picture consistent with the overall industry picture, assuming the farmers do not come off the sidelines and become kind of economic animals, once again making rational decisions. So I would still maintain that over time, Trimble is a cyclical resistant not exposed to the cycle, but not necessarily reacting in the same way as other players are, but I think the circumstances currently in agriculture are severe enough that it's taken a bite out of us. So different circumstances more than any kind of existential theorem here.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Understood. And you guys referenced some levers that you could potentially pull in the agriculture business. Could you maybe walk through what those levers are and some of the main risk points you see to the ag business perhaps weakening even further?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think that we've been comparatively more transparent in our thinking than we have been historically, so I think we're going with the flow at this point in time. I think -- I don't know if there's a precise industry consensus in terms of how much ag might be down in 2015, but we've talked it through, and okay, it seems like we're simply going with the flow and saying okay, the industry seems to believe that it will be down, call it, 15% I think as early as this morning, although I did not study the CNH release, but it sounds like they're talking 10% to 15% next year. So we're saying okay, that becomes our baseline calculation. Now the things we can do off that baseline calculation, assuming the farmers do not come back off the sidelines and start to kind of prioritize their investments, which I think would put Trimble at the -- near the top of the list of investments they would make, but assuming that doesn't happen, the discrete things we can do, first of all, on the irrigation product line. We talked about that earlier in the year, in particular 2014. We simply couldn't get the distribution channel in place by the time the season closed in kind of the fall of this year. We're now ready for the early spring season on irrigation. That is a new product category. It represents a step function. If we execute against it, and its early signs are quite positive there, it adds a whole new revenue category that we haven't had before. So we've got a strong value proposition here. We're putting the distribution in place. That could be a step function increase in revenue, and it's just a question as to how big it would be. Now the other thing is that in a relative sense, 2014 was a comparatively light year in terms of, if you will, new products with new features being put out there. 2015 should end up being a more substantial year in terms of product -- our new product introductions. Now there's an argument in terms of -- in this market environment, how big of a lift will that give us, but pretty much historically, going back 10 to 15 years, you can map the data, map the revenue and new product releases, you can see kind of the month that they were released because it does lift revenues. So we're expecting some effect from that in 2015. The third effect, which is we're getting a reasonable traction on this recurring agricultural services element, it's a very small number at this point in time, but it could add some incremental lift with next year. Now the question, and so we expect starting with the 15% reduction in agriculture next year, which is we're simply taking the industry view and saying okay, that will become our baseline. So we can adjust off that 15%, and we're saying that, okay, that 2015 could look like the early part of 2014, which was a single digit drop in agriculture and offset by the rest of the company growing at a significantly -- or growing at a relatively significant rate and okay -- increased -- creating aggregate growth for the company. But -- so in addition to those 3 things I named for agriculture, the list is much longer with smaller elements. So I think that our -- the people in our agriculture business are -- let's just say they have a stronger belief in the market and what we can do in the market than I just gave you, but I think that what we're attempting to provide you is a comparatively sober judgment that doesn't challenge kind of the facts that are already in existence within agriculture.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Steve, could you provide a little bit of color on the E&C segment of the business? Maybe just dig down into the 3 primary verticals there a little bit. I would've thought that maybe we could've seen a bit more growth in E&C. Did that disappoint? And then also, I just had a follow-up on the op profit there.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think E&C -- okay, breaking it down into kind of the 3 most significant elements, kind of the traditional business, the geospatial, the survey instruments and such is -- okay, we saw growth there. We're actually seeing kind of improving health there and actually some segments of that grew relatively stronger -- strongly double digits. Heavy civil is growing. It's growing kind of in a double-digit context, but we're still facing pretty strong headwinds that have been around for a while in Australia. Australia's economy does not seem to be improving. Australia is actually -- for its population size, a disproportionately significant market for us because they're very active users of technology, so that hasn't improved. And what we are seeing is places like Germany looking less healthy from an economic standpoint, so we are facing some economic headwinds in heavy civil. But -- and then within the U.S., it's a major question still remains about the highway bill, which, against the current condition, would be, if anything happens, that extends the time frame workout on the highway bill -- okay, that would be incremental good news to us from the current baseline. The third category, which is the healthiest category at this point in time, is the build -- kind of the building construction, the vertical construction market, which is in the U.S. quite robust. We're seeing good results in the U.S. We're adding capability. We're penetrating the market, and so that's the healthiest part of the segment at this point in time. Now overall to the -- under kind of normal circumstances would we have expected a bit more growth out of E&C in the quarter? Yes, but what we -- what seems to have gotten tougher in the last 3 months is the world economic environment with a particular focus on Europe and within Europe, a particular focus on Germany. So I think E&C is going to be influenced by the macroeconomics out there, and so we're watching that quite carefully now. The other point that I made in the script that I think is meaningful, aside from discussions on what we're doing relative to product and solutions strategically, is the fact that I think in the core markets against the core traditional competitors, we think we are taking share. So if you go into the industry data and kind of dissect it, allowing for exchange effects and other elements that don't pertain, we believe we're taking share at this point in time. So in the market -- in the sense of the market at this point in time, we're doing relatively well, but I think we're a little dependent upon the macroeconomic environment.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And is the -- maybe for Francois, is the op profit there -- again, we still grew the business by $31 million-ish year-over-year. And so the question is what -- why is our op profit down? Was the impact of acquisitions that significant?
Francois Delepine: Yes, I mean relative to E&C, it was significant because all the 3 acquisitions that we had in the quarter were in E&C, and there's a lot of kind of write-down that take place on the kind of preacquisition deferred revenue and so you end up having 100% of the expenses, but a very small revenue number. So that was the main thing. They also had, on a year-over-year basis, they had some trade shows in Q3 that didn't have the prior, but the main thing, you're right, is on the acquisition front.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And that's all, again, that's for revenue comes out of the -- I guess out of the numerator. But at the same time, that's an adjusted op profit, right? So there's no amortization in there, no restructuring or anything like that?
Francois Delepine: That's correct.
Steven W. Berglund: But I think getting to the main point here, the structural, the financial structure of E&C in terms of a structural operating margin really -- that picture hasn't changed, so I think that this is a quarterly or at least a short-term effect on operating margins we would expect to kind of continue on the secular trend of improving operating margins there because the software content continues to increase in that segment.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Brett Wong of Piper Jaffray.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: So I saw in the quarter that services subscription lifted, which seemed to help margins as you spoke about. What was the driver of the lift? And what are your expectations for service subscription going forward in the fourth quarter and in fiscal '15?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I wouldn't necessarily want to comment per se on the fourth quarter, but there -- and Francois may have some additional color to add here -- because partly it's not the way we look at the business. We look at the business as a series of vertical markets and we're not necessarily focused on kind of the nature of how we develop -- delivering solutions. But again, service content, recurring revenue content is increasing within the company, so there's certainly a long-term trend towards increasing kind of recurring service content or recurring revenue streams in one form or another within the company. And I think what you're seeing is part of a long-term trend. I don't know -- anything to add, Francois?
Francois Delepine: Yes, I mean, just another factor in your thinking, when you look at subscription in particular, it's on a year-on-year basis. The last year, we were, including VirtualSite Solution, or VSS, revenue, which is primarily subscription. That was about $7 million in Q3 of '13, which we didn't have. So if we factor that in, we have double-digit growth in the mid-teens actually in Q3. So subscription's going to continue to take a bigger and bigger share, but it's an evolution not a revolution. It's going to be a gradual progression.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay, great. And then I'm just going back to E&C, you gave us some nice color, Steve, on the impacts of the third quarter. Wondering if you could provide some of your expectations looking forward for E&C growth in the fourth quarter in 2015?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Well, again probably we'll avoid talking about the fourth quarter by segment just to avoid kind of setting new precedence here in kind of giving guidance at that level. But I think looking into 2015, kind of the 2 competing factors here. One, I think that, again, strategically in terms of new products, new capabilities, ability to access parts of the market that we have not had kind of direct access to, I'm thinking large projects, key accounts and potentially going after them with relatively new business models, all that is on the upside and we're certainly pretty sure of the U.S. at this point in time. It's the counteracting thing which leads to some caution when we're talking about 2015 in E&C is just the state of the world economy. Again, by now, we would have expected Australia to begin to show some signs of recovery. It really doesn't seem to have done that. We're looking at Germany with some concern and, okay, that brings with it the rest of Europe. Russia is probably, not to be overly dramatic here, kind of turns out to be a write-off for next year. So it's those international issues that I think are the -- a little bit of a -- enough of a concern that I'm not being outlandishly bullish about E&C, but from a business dynamic standpoint, I think we're very, very aggressive, very ambitious and very positive about the prospects for E&C both, yes, for 2015, but then maybe more so beyond 2015. There are a number of things that are happening strategically here that should benefit us in the long term.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And then one last one for me. You spoke to some opportunities that you could see with new product launches next year in ag. And I just wondered you kind of commented about it a little bit in your remarks, but if -- we've seen a recent lift in grain prices, but in this kind of weaker grain price environment, could you talk to the confidence you have in that adoption of those new products in this current backdrop?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think kind of actively avoiding being overly specific and overly quantified here, just we've learned a fair amount of humility during the course of 2014 on kind of the ag market. We've had a couple of surprises. But I would say is we -- what we're certain about is that the fact that it will have a beneficial impact. How much of a beneficial impact under the current circumstances? I think we're being fairly careful of, but it should be in terms of environment, in terms of a channel having something new to sell, which is always motivating for a channel. All of that makes us at least relatively more confident about 2015 than we were in 2014. So I'm actively dodging your question in terms of specifics, but I think that directionally, it should be quite positive.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: A few questions. First off, I want to kind of extend on Brett's question there a little bit about this environment and kind of the new products you got in rollouts. And specifically, what do you believe is sort of the competitive response to the down cycle and how is that impacting the competitive environment in terms of your pricing or in terms of, I know we've seen some new entry into the markets. Another example would be some of these certified preowned program that are including kind of tech upgrades. I mean, how are all of these competitive responses to the downturn impacting your business?
Steven W. Berglund: So as near as we can detect, and right now, I would describe the market as quite confused. And I think you're seeing some of that confusion come to us through the equipment manufacturers, channels and the factories in the third and fourth quarter. So I think it's a comparatively confused environment at this point in time where people are trying to find bottom and trying to get themselves properly aligned for a change. [indiscernible] I won't claim perfect insight, but I would say is in -- you mentioned new entrants. I think the new entrant issue is still some time away in terms of actually impacting our market in terms of what we're selling today. So I think that in terms of what's affecting us, I would not actually attribute much of our current set of issues to competitive issues per se. I don't think we're losing in the marketplace. I don't think we're losing share points in the marketplace. I think competitors, the -- I think maybe the most aggressive competitor at this point in time is probably Deere in terms of kind of active promotion within their own channel. At the same time, I could come up with countervailing anecdotes about Trimble equipment on Deere tractors, but I would say substantially the competitive environment has not changed in the last year or 2. Now there are fundamental structural changes taking place in the market though, not per se competitive, but we're actively attempting to realign our channel to be more capable of selling future information and data services so there is a structural realignment in the market that's causing at the minimum commentary and could be contributing some -- as we've talked about in prior quarters, contributing to some of our current set of issues in agriculture. But as of today, in terms of current environment, third and fourth quarter sort of environment, I would not be laying off our set of difficulties on kind of a change in competition. It's largely other issues.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then my other question is more big picture in nature, Steve. I guess the aftermarket, some of these OEMs, you mentioned factory installed, channel and so forth, as that becomes more prevalent, what's the state and the direction of the aftermarket and the retrofit market? Big picture looking beyond the cycle as more of this legacy guidance equipment goes in at the factory level, what does it do to your aftermarket outlook and will you be able to make up any decline of that market with a shift into the OEM channel at a competitive margin?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So our assumption has always been, well, I mean actually, extending your question beyond probably what you intended here, but talking about construction and OEM for a second, when we entered into the first joint venture with Caterpillar back in 2002, our assumption in construction was that the market by now, in fact, the market a long time ago would've gone 100% OEM. It was going to be 100% factory installed. It hasn't gone that way. It's still dominated by aftermarket and may actually be permanently an aftermarket sort of market simply because the contractors have a mixed fleet problem and they don't necessarily want the factory install. That issue is smaller in agriculture, but it's still an issue. But I think that our strategic presumption in agriculture today would be that, okay, inevitably the strap-on elements of guidance are going to be factory install, and okay, that's always a part of our view of the marketplace. Now we have a growing OEM presence. So we are -- some of it visible, some of it not visible, but we are talking to a wide number or a large number of the equipment manufacturers with the idea of giving them the OEM content. But our basic view of the market, as it is in construction, is that the fundamental market is going to change. And that the substantial economics, the larger market potential is actually in terms of software and information, not on kind of the guidance-oriented hardware. So it would be our ambition over the next few years is to see the business, and again, both construction and agriculture, become more and more of a, forgive the expression, Big Data sort of solution. So our strategy basically calls for yes, that we'll continue to provide guidance solutions, which are becoming more and more robust and involve more than guidance. And if it goes factory fit, yes, that's fine, that's what we're assuming. But that the -- that what we're after is looking at the number of acres under cultivation world is extracting a revenue per acre in some fashion through providing services, through providing software and the like. And again, that's the element of the business. That's very -- it's still tiny but is actually growing at kind of very significant rates, and I think should become during 2015 be more and more of the story. So yes, so I think that we will continue to be active in guidance. It will still be a primary part of the business, but should be a diminishing part of the business as these other elements start to come into play, like irrigation, which is still kind of a hardware-centric business that has nothing to do with the equipment manufacturers, which is very much an aftermarket sale even though -- or in collaboration with the irrigation system manufacturers, but then again, I'd say that in 3 to 5 years, I would expect kind of the information elements to be a much larger part of the business than they are today.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay, finally, just a housekeeping clarification and confirmation for me. Did you say in your prepared remarks that your expectation for '15 is about a 15% decline in agriculture? Or was -- did I mishear that?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think that -- to provide you all with a construct is, I think, again, we're assuming the basic, what seems to be kind of the consensus out there, down 15%. Whether we actually see that or not is a subject to some debate, but we're conceding the 15% and we're basically talking about how we do better than the 15%. So we're trying to provide some transparency to help you figure it out.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: The 4 to 6 percentage points of inorganic growth you expect in '15, can you say how much of that you have in hand from acquisitions already completed and how much of that is from acquisitions you expect to complete?
Francois Delepine: I think it would be a good assumption to assume that we're on the low end of the range, we're taking very little risks. So I think if you tell me 4%, I'd probably agree with it.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: As in 4% you had sort of have in hand?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, more or less. It's not exactly a science, but yes, so I think the bottom end of the range is pretty secure.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Perfect. And then, Steve, last year at this time, you were pretty confident about new products driving ag above whatever the market did. What happened there? Did the products not roll out? Or did the market just turn down steeper? What's different about going into this year than going into '14 when you also thought you had a strong new product lineup?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So a year ago, well, just talking about a year ago, kind of same time framework, we were in a little bit of a bubble as it turns out in the second half of the year. We saw double-digit growth in ag in the fourth quarter and something not too far from that in the third quarter. So we were actually thinking that, okay, we did have the formula dialed in terms of how to be countercyclical. But yes, in terms of kind of laying out the reasons we should be better than market, if you will, you would've heard irrigation, I think a year ago, or at least in kind of January, down when we simply couldn't get enough distribution in place fast enough to kind of meet the season so we did some learning there, but we did talk about new products. And there was, I'd call, less of a market issue than a, frankly, a bit of an execution issue on the new products is we were focusing our development efforts in one arena called the OEM arena when in reality we should've been devoting them to the kind of the aftermarket kind of more information-based universe. We have shifted that focus. So we didn't have our focus right in 2014, and so we were slow and a bit underfeatured in terms of new product sets. We believe we got that one -- we're pretty sure that we got that dialed in now and so that I think our 2015 response is simply going to be better than our 2014 response on new products. We'll see what the -- ultimately quantifiably how the market reacts to them, but I think we're much more secure this year than we were last year and we've got much more of a focus on kind of the aftermarket this year.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Fair enough, and one more if I could. Advanced Devices has been, I think, a bit of a pleasant surprise this year in terms of its strength. Can you give us a sense of where you see that business going? Do you see it continuing to grow, flattening? What do we think of that? Any color on how you think about '15.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. If I were sitting where you would -- you're sitting, I would be basically, in the longer-term anyway, looking at Advanced Devices being comparatively flat. To some extent, some traditional OEM business, the embedded kind of board or chip level sort of business, it's a timing business that are tied into kind of large infrastructure place that they just don't have kind of the growth dynamics. There's a relatively small military business in Advanced Devices. So there isn't inherently, a whole lot of -- they're not typically end-user markets and therefore we have fewer knobs to turn to kind of dial up growth. There are some interesting elements in that segment for the longer term. The RFID business is in there. The inertial business is in there. I think at some point, we could start to talk more about the segment. So for example, the RFID business is actually -- their primary customer set is inside Trimble, so tracking items on construction sites, determining what's in my van for field service and those sorts of things. But I think the segment has maybe longer term, maybe some longer-term dynamics, but I'd say in the kind of the 1- to 3-year time framework, I would call them relatively flattish from a growth perspective.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Securities.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Can we -- I'll go back over, I guess during Francois' presentation, you talked about -- there was a normalization of about $50 million to get the comparison, and I understand the ag business pretty well, as you probably know. What was the other part besides the ag that you're referring to and the magnitude of $50 million of it?
Francois Delepine: Yes. So again, the total was $50 million, right, 5-0. I don't know if that's what you mentioned, or I wasn't sure if you said 15. So I would say, about 1/2 of that is ag roughly. And then in Q4 last year, there are 2 other elements, one is a kind of discrete revenue recognition item, which we mentioned in Q1, when we reported our Q4 results. And the other one is the VSS, which used to be consolidated in our results in 2013, but became deconsolidated, if you will, in '14. And so that's the other half of the $50 million, and about 75% of that, if you will, is the discrete item and 25% is the VSS impact roughly. Again, I'm just kind of trying to give you a rough indication of the mix there.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And that's all -- that's out of the equation at this point, so we have an apples-to-apples comparison coming, correct?
Francois Delepine: Well, what I was trying to do there is kind of explain the guidance and kind of compare it to the Q4 revenue that we had last year and we wanted to kind of explain the revenue guidance that way.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Moving on. The ag market revenue -- I decided to ask Steve [ph] -- I know everybody has a 15% decline, the ag market decline in the next 6 to 9 months is much more severe than that because of inventory liquidation and as you mentioned because of a pre-buy last year that occurred still going on. So as you point out, as you're looking at, are you compensating for the fact that it's going to be sort of a weird year in the way the spending patterns will take place next year, particularly in the OEM side of it? Or are you just thinking that, that will be minimal impact on Trimble in the first half of next year?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so -- I mean, I think first of all, we're talking about the full year, so we don't want to be particularly descriptive of how that year folds up, but I think, Eli, kind of the reason for going on at length in the script was the fact that I think that what we're seeing -- what we saw in the third quarter, what we're seeing in the fourth quarter, I think are those effects flowing straight through to us. So I think that our inventory effect will have taken place in the third and fourth quarter, but I think we're basically supplying within kind of very short time framework, so that weeks out, we saw kind of a step-function drop in the demand being placed on us. So I think that overall, my assumption is that we're going to see the, if you will, the inventory or effect or the kind of the radical reduction in the third and fourth quarter, that what we will be seeing by the time we get into next year will be actual end-user market demand and that we will have already experienced the inventory effects. So let's see how that plays out. But we are such a short-fused, quick-reaction part of the chain is that any inventory effects should flush through very quickly for us.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And we've put some of the sectors to debt, but can we talk a little bit about Mobile Solutions as you look out over the next fourth quarter, particularly in 2015 as how we should think about that business?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so again, I don't want to be overly specific here, but okay, here's the way I would -- I'm formulating it, which is -- okay, we've got, fundamentally, a double-digit growth part of that segment, transportation and logistics. So that's double-digit growth. Now the drag on that segment has been this field services piece, a business that we're really committed to as being fundamental to the Trimble strategy. But what's occurred over the last couple of years, we've swapped -- we're swapping out a majority of the revenue for a new majority as we kind of flesh out the horizontal small business -- small to medium business element of it, so we -- it's been kind of an awkward transition. For 2015, we expect, although field services probably won't be a rocket ship in 2015, we do expect that it will no longer be a drag at least for the full year of 2015. And so the drag on that segment will be diminished and what we'll start to see is kind of the more fundamental double-digit growth of transportation and logistics showing through. And then, okay, maybe later in 2015, we start to see the more and more positive contributions from field services. So I would at this point, for the full year 2015, without necessarily talking about when exactly it will occur, I would expect, let's call it, both a growth and a operating margin acceleration in 2015 in Mobile Solutions. That's what we're attempting to engineer at this point.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And Francois, can you give -- Francois, give us some idea what should we think about for tax rate next year. And also, particularly currency, which really had no effect this point, but we've seen some radical changes and we're starting to hear some impact as we look out a little bit.
Francois Delepine: Yes. So on the tax rate, I don't have kind of a strong view on next year at this point, and I think we're going to end this year in the neighborhood of 22%, it looks like. If I were in your shoes, I'd probably assume the next -- kind of a similar rate for next year, but I don't have the specific analysis to kind of tell you that, that's going to be the case, but that would seem like kind of a logical conclusion at this point. With regards to currency, so if we look at the kind of September euro rate in particular, some of -- so that would be kind of what is built into our kind of Q4 guidance and our -- and implied thinking for 2015 at this point. So obviously, if currency deteriorates in the sense that the dollar strengthens due to foreign currencies, then that would certainly potentially have an impact on the top line, although, on the bottom line, it's fairly well neutralized given how distributed our spending is and we have natural hedging taking place.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: The decline of the euro, which really occurred in the last few months from 1.34 to 1.25. At 1.25, 1.26, you still have de minimis effect on currency next year?
Francois Delepine: Yes, I would say right now, they're kind of the rate that assumed is in kind of high 1.20s, 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, depending on -- because I think some of the businesses, but that's what they -- that's roughly where we are. And so the impact would probably be more in the first half than the second half because we're starting to see some of the rate impact here in Q3, particularly in Q4.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: So you won't have some negative impact for the next couple of quarters. That's what I'm just trying to get...
Francois Delepine: Yes.
Operator: And the final question for today will come from the line of Chrishan of MKM Partners.
Chrishan Anketell: Maybe you can just talk about how the ag sales force is adjusting to the present environment.
Steven W. Berglund: Well, they're not happy, I'll tell you that. But I think we've been through bouts before, so we understand hard times, we understand adversity. The organization has been through bad times before. So I think the sales force are more properly since it's largely a third-party channel. The third party channel is adapting well and is doing what third party channels are supposed to do, they're adapting. And so I think that -- okay, it's an adverse situation, and okay, people are adapting to it. I think the element that I talked to just a little while ago that is new, which may be creating some stress in the channel, is the fact that we are attempting to redirect ourselves more and more to kind of the information around the data realm, which is involving a conversation with the dealer channel in terms of capabilities and investments and things like that. So I think that probably the channel is reacting as you would expect the channel to react during hard times, that they're working harder and they're scratching harder and they're -- but I think that this other element probably is adding a little stress to the channel as well. But overall, I think that kind of overall that they're adapting, they're reacting to it.
Chrishan Anketell: Sure. Maybe you can talk about -- going to a different subject, your framework for divesting and monetizing noncore businesses, I mean the older commodity hardware stuff that -- where China competition is taking share.
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think that invokes a hypothesis that isn't actually in evidence yet, which is the Chinese. Thinking across the company, the Chinese are not a factor in any of our businesses, at least yet, in terms of low-end survey instruments where we don't have a -- which is not a market focus for us. On a statistical basis, the Chinese manufacturers provide a whole lot of low-end survey instruments, but it's not a market segment that we're focused on. So we're not competing with the Chinese, and right now, the Chinese are largely concentrated in China with some access to Latin America. So I would say that we don't have, let's call it, at this point in time, commodity products that are coming under that sort of challenge. So really not much to say about the subject.
Operator: And we thank you very much for your participation in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kelly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Jim Todd, you may begin your conference.
Jim Todd: Good afternoon. I'm here today with: Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Francois Delepine, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release, which is available, along with additional financial information on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. The second quarter again consisted of a two-part story. The first part of the story is agriculture, which continues to operate in a constrained market with revenue down single digits year-to-year. The second part of the story is everything outside of the Field Solutions segment, which had revenue growth of over 14% and non-GAAP operating earnings growth of approximately 40%. The net of the 2 stories produced total company revenue of over 11% and a significant improvement in the financial model, with non-GAAP gross margins growing to 58.5% and non-GAAP operating margin improving to 23.2%. Most of the revenue growth was organic with little acquisition effect. An implicit side effect of the current accelerated development of the company outside of agriculture is that we are becoming more balanced and less reliant on agriculture. Overall, the market picture continues to improve but with qualifications. The U.S. is trending up, but in a comparatively constrained way. The status of the U.S. Highway Bill has been a major source of ambiguity and is muting the willingness to make investments in the heavy civil and geospatial markets. Europe is demonstrating more signs of life and probably provides us with upside in the next year. This judgment is still tentative and the second order effects of the geopolitics of Russia and Ukraine may dampen the appetite for investment around Europe. In their own right, Russian and Ukraine are meaningful markets for agriculture and we're a growing market for E&C. The environment has grown difficult in Russia and has reduced our short-term expectations there. Ukraine is still accessible, but priorities have shifted away from spending in our categories. Neither market is likely to give us much in the next year. While not particularly material in the short term, a sustained freeze in the Russian relationship could have longer-term implications given the potential of the market. Australia has not improved as we hoped after the change in government and remains a drag on results and a source of volatility in our forecast, particularly in E&C. The other emerging markets, including Brazil, China, Middle East, Africa and India are generally still tracking sideways and are not providing as much automatic market lift as they were a few years ago. In addition, they are adding increased volatility. We continue to grow in these markets, in some cases, rapidly, just not at historical peak levels. Clearly, India has become more interesting with the change in government. With an emphasis on red tape reduction and infrastructure investment, it could rapidly become a much more significant market for Trimble. E&C's 17% revenue growth is a result of continued market penetration, some improvement in Europe and continuing improvements in the U.S. Australia is currently the most significant regional drag on the segment. We continue to believe we are in a period in which the construction industry is crossing the chasm and its adoption of technology manifested by the number of use cases, in which contractors are using technology to bend the cost curve on entire projects by 25% to 30%. As the magnitude of these economics are validated, there are several implications, all of them disruptive and all of which provide opportunity. One is that it enforces a new paradigm of disruptive competition within the wider construction industry in which those contractors who are aggressive users of technology are rewarded with market share and those who are slow in adoption are at risk. This should accelerate market penetration. Another implication is that the nature of the technology solution changes. Traditionally, technology has come to the construction industry through a number of point solutions, which were loosely integrated at best. These included computerized design tools, estimating software, scheduling software, geospatial instruments, machine control and on-site alignment tools. To capture the full magnitude of the potential cost reductions, these point solutions will need to be more tightly integrated in the future. The Trimble approach to achieving the needed level of integration is built around what we call the constructible model. In our definition, the constructible model includes both the conventional geometric design model, as well as other construction-centric elements that impact scheduling cost. Trimble currently occupies a comparatively unique position in this disruptive evolution because we can link this model to the physical activities on the construction site and thereby bring the abstractions of the model into the machine, the tool or the site logistics. This hands-on approach is central to achieving potential cost breakouts because over 90% of project cost is typically concentrated in the build cycle. Although Trimble solutions will provide a significant portion of the value, there will be a strong need to collaborate with other providers to bring a comprehensive solution to the contractor. The recent press release announcing an extension of the collaboration between Trimble and Bentley Systems is, therefore, meaningful in terms of building the greater ecosystem. Another point of potential disruption comes about through mapping the effect of reducing project costs by 25% to 30% in a trillion-dollar industry. The magnitude of the benefit has the potential to swamp traditional points of resistance to change within the owner, architectural, engineering and contract communities. Legacy solutions may be at risk, even if they involve substantial change costs if they do not support the new, more evolved, more productive solution. Another disruptive effect may be the impact on the business model of technology providers like Trimble. Our strategic starting point is to believe that the basic economic unit for the contractor or the owner is the project and that most contractors typically view their enterprise profitability more or less as an aggregation of their projects. Our primary focus is therefore in delivering specific value at the project level. Although the trend is not yet completely clear, we believe pricing and the delivery of technology will increasingly be built around the specific requirements of the project on an as needed basis and potentially bundled as a comprehensive solution. We believe this trend will favor Trimble because we provide a stronger profit franchise. We have open architecture philosophy, which enables us to integrate with best-of-class solutions provided by others. We have a channel that can support the full hardware and software solution, we have international scope and we will facilitate adoption by adding more professional services. While individual quarterly results for E&C may be lumpy given the uncertainties in regional markets, we continue to believe this strategic secular trend for the construction market is stronger than at any point in our past, although revenue levels in some product categories may not be back to the relative peak we saw in 2007. Subject to continuing qualifications about market conditions around the world, we expect the next 12 months to be relatively strong for the segment. Our agriculture sales continue to be lackluster in the second quarter, and we experienced a single digit year-to-year revenue decline. The issues we identified in the first quarter continued to be factors in the second quarter, which included Russia and Ukraine, the weather and some dislocation in the channel as we shift product focus toward a more information-centric product offering. It is becoming clear that the effects of lower commodity prices are now impacting us more than we had originally anticipated. Our historical view in agriculture has always been that we were relatively insensitive to commodity price changes as long as they remained within a band. We held this view since the ROI we were providing was strong enough that we could sell their merits even if the farmer were holding back on other purchasing decisions. It is apparent that current commodity prices have pushed outside that band and had caused farmers to scale back on all investments, including ours. This is negatively impacting our agricultural revenue most significantly in North America and to a lesser extent, in Europe. On the other hand, revenue in South America and Asia Pacific was up double digits. We expect this relative level of ambiguity will be with us through the remainder of the year. The outlook for agriculture contained in our overall guidance is comparatively conservative. The basis for longer term optimism on the agricultural market growth potential remains unchanged and arise from the migration to a new technology generation that moves from point solutions to whole farm modeling, which will balance input decisions, plantings and fertilizing options and investments. The other major Field Solutions element, Geographic Information Systems, continue to grow in the quarter as it continues its recovery from last year's performance. Our Mobile Solutions segment provided us with 6% year-to-year revenue growth in the quarter with strong non-GAAP earnings growth. The core transportation and logistics business grew comfortably at a double-digit rate. The businesses that acted as a drag on the segment's growth were Field Services and Construction Supply. Construction Supply results have declined this year as we awaited new products, which are now being rolled out. Field Services has been affected by delays in major contract awards and may not turn on fully until early 2015. Public safety, which has been hunkered down mode since the government funding [indiscernible] in 2009, has seen signs of revival in funding and appears to be in the early stages of recovery. While we are now reaching our long-term double-digit growth expectations for the Mobile Solutions segment in 2014 because of the drag of these comparatively small businesses, we remain comfortable in the double-digit growth potential of the segment. Total company guidance systems continued improvement in the construction market, a continuing difficult agricultural market and performance in Mobile Solutions consistent with year-to-year to date -- with year-to-date performance. We anticipate a pickup in our acquisition activity in the second half of the year although the activity is not likely to have a material impact on third quarter results. Let me turn the call over to Francois. Francois?
Francois Delepine: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. As Steve mentioned, the quarter was stronger than expected with continued growth in Engineering and Construction, Mobile Solutions and Advanced Devices, along with mixed performance in the Field Solutions segment. I'd like to remind you that, unless otherwise noted, the operating results I will discuss will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is available in our earnings press release, along with the financial data by segment. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. So let's now discuss the results for the second quarter. Total revenue was $642 million, up over 11% year-over-year. For the second quarter in a row, we experienced broad-based growth in the quarter in the majority of our businesses with exception of our agriculture business. Most of the growth in the quarter was organic in nature. Engineering and Construction grew by 17% with continued strength in buildings, heavy civil and geospatial. Field Solutions revenue was down 1% with agriculture revenue down in the mid-single digits offset by growth in GIS revenue. Mobile Solutions grew 6% with double-digit growth from the transportation and logistics business. Advanced Devices repeated with another strong quarter growing 17% driven by strength in multiple businesses in the portfolio. The Q2 revenue by geography was 53% coming from North America, 25% from Europe, 15% from Asia Pacific and 7% from the rest of the world. Growth rates by region were 6% in North America, 20% in Europe, 15% in Asia Pacific and 16% in the rest of the world. Note that the underlying European growth rate was enhanced by a positive revenue recognition event involving a distributor. The growth in North America came primarily from Engineering and Construction and Mobile Solutions, offset by a single-digit decline in Field Solutions linked to agriculture. Europe saw growth in all segments, with strength in Engineering and Construction, Mobile Solution and Advanced Devices. Most countries in Europe had improved performance with a notable exception of Russia, which, as expected, was down significantly for the second quarter in a row. Asia Pacific returned to double-digit growth with stronger sales across all segment. Within Asia Pacific, China was our strongest country, while Australia remained relatively weak and was down year-over-year. In the rest of the world, South Africa and Brazil were the main growth contributors in the second quarter. The impact of foreign currency fluctuation in the quarter was marginally positive and contributed less than 1% of revenue. We're pleased with our gross margin and operating income performance this quarter. Q2 gross margin was a record 58.5%, up 2.3 points over the second quarter of 2013 driven by the continued evolution of our portfolio toward a bundle of hardware, software, maintenance and subscription services. Q2 operating expense was $227 million or 35.3% of revenue versus 35.4% during the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter operating income increased 24% to $149 million or 23.2% of revenue as compared to $120 million or 20.9% of revenue in the second quarter of 2013. Operating leverage on incremental revenue was 43% in the quarter, making this our third quarter in a row with operating leverage greater than 35%. The effective income tax rate was 21% in line with our expectations and compares to 20% in Q2 2013. Q2 net income was $121 million which was up 23% as compared to Q2 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $0.45 compared with $0.38 in the second quarter of 2013. We finished the second quarter of 2014 with $279 million of cash. We paid down and reduced our debt by $9 million paying off the outstanding balance of our revolver facility, and we ended with $656 million of debt at the end of Q2 2014 versus $665 million at the end of Q1 2014. Cash flow from operations was $131 million for Q2 '14 and $215 million for the first half 2014. Cash flow from operations for the first half 2014 versus the first half 2013 was up 25%. At the end of Q2, accounts receivable was $380 million and day sales outstanding was 54 days as compared to 60 days at the end of Q1 2014 and 56 days at the end of Q2 2013. We're pleased with the overall quality of our AR portfolio. Q2 ending inventory was $274 million compared to $267 million at the end of Q1 2014 and $259 million at the end of Q2 last year. I will now turn to our guidance for the third quarter of 2014. We expect revenue to be between $590 million and $610 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.24 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.40. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $37 million related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $4 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $11 million. Q3 2014 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assume a 20% to 22% tax rate and approximately 265 million shares outstanding. The tax rate does not assume the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Note that the share count forecast reflect stock repurchases under our outstanding $100 million authorization, which began early this quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. So far this quarter, the third quarter, we have repurchased approximately 1.37 million shares, again, 1.37 million shares for a total of $43.2 million. This number could increase based on any additional stock repurchase activity in the remainder of the quarter. Note that as I communicated during our capital strategy update, our Investor Day in June, our first priority continues to be to invest in the business, to grow organically and through M&A. If those needs are met and our leverage ratio is low, we have the opportunity to repurchase shares to complement shareholder returns. This quarter, we will be participating in the Canaccord Growth Conference in Boston on August 13, the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference in Las Vegas in September 10 and the JPMorgan U.S. All-Star Conference in London on September 17. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So perhaps if you could just give us a little bit of a sense of how the business mix is changing. You talked about the software, hardware maintenance and service mix. I'm particularly interested inside the E&C space and what if anything that means in terms of future margin expansion?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think there is definitely a, let's call it, a strategic secular trend involved here and -- which is -- which will move towards the greater services bundle [ph] and greater software component. The trend has been in place for a number of years and I think is, if anything, accelerating at this point in time. So I think the general trend, directionally anyway, is towards a generally higher gross margin business within E&C and with the expectation that we can continue to show progress at the operating line. I think the one caveat there would be -- I think gross margin is interesting within the company from a direct -- kind of a directional sense but is largely an arithmetic outcome from the mix of business. In the script, I mentioned the fact that we anticipated a higher professional services content within the company, and in particular E&C that will probably push the margin around a bit. And so from an ROIC standpoint, that would still be a strong business, but it may change the nature of the margin. But I will say directionally, is the nature of the business is towards more software, more services and I would intend to say towards a higher gross margin content as we add more and more software value and then, again, that should translate into operating.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can I just sort of press, maybe Francois, a little bit and see if he could give us -- share with us what percentage of revenue now is recurring, what percentage of revenue is, in total, is software and related services.
Francois Delepine: Yes, I don't have those numbers handy here to share. I don't think we've shared that historically. I think we're looking at it -- I mean, I mentioned at the Analyst Day we're starting to do a bit more analysis to kind of understand our trends and billings and recurring revenue and the impact on deferred revenue, et cetera. But we don't plan to kind of communicate those kinds of elements at this point. We may do it next year, but we're doing some analysis at this point on that.
Steven W. Berglund: Paul, I think there's a bit of a point here and again, referring back to the script here a little bit, is that in kind of the engagement with the contractor, kind of within the E&C context, is increasingly, we're having the conversation about the needs of a project. Now that may include hardware, that may include software, that may include services. But increasingly, kind of the differentiation in terms of what's hardware, what's software, what services will tend to get a little bit blended is what we're bringing is a value, a bundle to contractor, really increasingly focused on a single project. And so I think that from our internal architecture in terms of how we think about things, it's really the kind of the share of the wallet concept around the project more so than what's recurring, and what SaaS [ph], what's that [ph], but I think it's really -- we'll see how it develops but I think over the next few years, it's going to be more of a concept of share of wallet than per se, let's call it, a discrete breakout between different kind of product categories.
Operator: You're next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to start out with your assumptions around Field Solutions for the balance of the year. And how maybe we should be thinking about modeling it relative to your performance so far in the first half of this year. I just want to make sure that we're thinking about it sort of the right way just given your commentary.
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think in general, we're -- the biggest driver, at least in terms of volatility, at the moment is agriculture. We're -- our current outlook with a fair amount of qualification is flattish but I think that in terms of the range of outcomes for the company are kind of largely driven by a range of outcomes on agriculture. So I would say the general expectation is flattish, but acknowledging that there is a fair amount of volatility that kind of creates a kind of a tails around that distribution both sides of that expectation.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And just a little bit more detail. I think you guys talked about some distributor revenue recognition in the EMEA region. Just wanted to get a little bit more detail or maybe the amount of that revenue recognition and where that's coming from.
Francois Delepine: Yes. So it came from -- essentially, you can think of it as a large increase to a distributor credit line as a result of increasing the capital that the distributor was able to secure to summarize it. And the impact on the European growth rate was about half of that growth rate.
Operator: You're next question comes from the line of Andrea James of Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Monsanto recently communicated, I guess, a similar philosophy to you guys in terms of ag becoming a big data solution. And I was just wondering if you see their shift in investment toward more software solutions in the ag space as a competitive threat or more of an endorsement of what you guys are doing there.
Steven W. Berglund: Sorry, Andrea, who was that?
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Monsanto.
Steven W. Berglund: Monsanto. Well, Monsanto has clearly been, for some time now, been voicing, kind of, a vision of the market, that is really focused on kind of let's call it, big data sort of orientation. So I think that it's really, really too soon to kind of start -- talk about hard characterization of anybody in the marketplace to a fair extent, both we and they, and as well as others are talking about an emerging future, elements of the product and elements of the solution are emerging all the time. But I think in terms of kind of as of today, the revenues associated with it are comparatively small. So I think that it's too early to kind of come up with competitor versus collaborators, sorts of definitions for anyone. I think the market is still emergent and still fairly slippery in terms of its ultimate definitions here. So I'll avoid the characterization question at this point in time. I would say is that certainly Monsanto is -- has a presence in the market, it has a brand, it has a reasonable level of domain and so I think that it is a player. But I wouldn't want to necessarily characterize it one way or the other at this point in time. What we're attempting to do is put together all the elements of the solution and to bring it to the marketplace and we'll see how the marketplace evolves.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just flipping over to your Q3 guidance. It looks like you're looking for a 7% sequential decline. But if I look back historically, you almost never have a Q3 sequential decline except maybe during the recession of '09. So I was just wondering, what -- could you just maybe take us a little bit more through how you kind of came up with the guidance and the puts and takes there?
Francois Delepine: Yes. So let me take that one. I think if you look at the last couple of years actually, we did have a sequential decline from Q2 to Q3, not of that magnitude, but probably about half of that magnitude. And then if you look at the revenue recognition, in fact, we just mentioned and you take that out and look at the sequential change that way, and you look at the -- if you were to pick the high end of our range and look at that compared to Q2, you get to about the same type of dynamics, seasonal dynamics. So we're being relatively circumspect about our guidance here in the second -- in the third quarter, and we -- that's how we came up with the range. I mean, as Steve said, there's still some fair amount of risk in ag and so that's kind of built into our guidance as well.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: That actually really is helpful. Just one more for me and then I'll get out of line. I'm kind of -- kind of characterize what's going on in the whole world. You guys have so many puts and takes, Russia, bad; India is good. Is India's infrastructure investment enough to sort of move the needle and maybe offset some of what's going on in Russia right now? Or can you just help characterize in terms of dollars or ranking, what's good and what's bad, globally?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Well, I think that -- the way I characterized it in the script was, okay, kind of generally, most of the emerging economies are comparatively kind of going sideways, not really bad. The only one, not that it's an emerging economy, but the only economy out there that I would characterize as bad, at this point in time, is Australia which is causing us some problems, particularly in E&C. But you walk around the world and I would say whether it be China or Brazil or South Africa or India or any or the rest of them, I would say characterize them as being workable but not great. I wouldn't characterize any of them as being great. Clearly, the mode in Russia is quite negative at this point in time, and we're seeing the outcome. Now Russia, as a needle mover for us, as a company, isn't all that large. It's meaningful for ag, it has a significant amount of potential for ag as it does for E&C. So I think Russia is more of a -- the perspective of Russia is more of a 2- or 3-year or 4-year view in terms of, okay, if this kind of freeze continues, it could potentially take 1 point or 2 off of -- or some level of growth off of the next 2 or 3 years. But it isn't -- I wouldn't expect us to be necessarily focusing on Russia over the next few quarters as being a necessarily a needle mover for the company. Now I would also, in the next year or 2, probably put India in much the same category, which is India is more nascent, it's more prospective, it's more a set of possibilities than it is a potential source of dollars for us in the next year or 2. India obviously has great potential. India, for the last couple of years, has been a little hard to decipher because it's been comparatively indecisive around its economic policy. That seems to have resolved itself or at least there seems to be a higher level of decisiveness, a higher level of purpose in India. If India does decide to move on infrastructure, it has the potential to be a significant addition of revenue to us, particularly in E&C, although I would not discount the possibilities in agriculture either. But just the lead time would say, okay, that's got to be a 2- or 3-year sort of perspective not a 12-month perspective in India. So I would say both markets are more future events as looking ahead to the next 12 months than anything that's going to be, particularly meaningful for us in the next 12 months.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing of MKM Partners.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: So in construction, you've got some nice productivity solutions with contractors, they're understanding the benefits. What's the role of subcontractors here as you enable the contractors? Is there an additional sale for the subcontractor, are you cannibalizing some of the sub kind of opportunities? And the reason I asked is some of your construction site collateral does talk about enabling people to do their own site positioning and surveying, basically, avoiding subcontracting, that type of workouts.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So well, without a doubt, there's kind of a web of relationships here. And so I would say is what we're doing -- well, particularly on the building side, the vertical construction more so than the infrastructure heavy civil kind of dirt moving, but certainly when it comes to constructing buildings or constructing structures, there is a multitiers here and I would say that were equally relevant for kind of the -- all elements here. So there are really 2 different categories of contractors, I'm simplifying outrageously here. But there are self-perform contractors who, more or less, keep all the operations in-house. And then there are other contractors who make active use of subcontractors who basically get the umbrella contract and then subcontract out to a number of other contractors. The technology is relevant in all cases. I think there is an argument to be made is that the self-perform contractor may be able to better utilize the technology because they have more control over all the operations and can achieve maybe a more optimal model. But the way we're organized is we look to the individual trades. So we have a business that is, what we call, MEP, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, which really is focused on the individual trades, the subcontractors, if you will, and performing work for the contractor. But I would say the ecosystem that involves contractors and subcontractors is a little bit more complicated in terms of, okay, who's getting the economic benefits of the technology and how are they being shared? And in that case, across the board, the owner would have some interest in that as well. So I think that, again, I think that over the next few years, it's a little bit of an interesting experiment to see just how the sharing of the benefits of the technology actually occur. But I would say it's the subcontractors, as well as contractors are actively engaged in the technology and our relative hope and our relative expectation is that increasingly, the owner is going to drive down through the general contractor, down through the subcontractors, down to the trades and actually start to mandate what the technology environment is going to be and expect everyone to conform to the same architecture from a technology standpoint and you see that happening. I think that the trend will accelerate over the next few years.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: And then North American E&C. It seems like some pretty nice secular trends you're exposed to. I mean, this is even despite the stop-gap funding of the federal highway trust fund and some pretty negative global headlines. So is there anything in your mind that could take takes things off that track in E&C in North America at this point?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think North America is on a track. The things that could happen in the next 6 to 12 months that would give us upside lift implicitly I think that maybe the bias is towards the upside if these things occur. One would be if Congress does come back either lame duck session or post new Congress and actually puts in multiyear funding -- or let's call it permanent funding for the highway infrastructure, I think that would be relatively huge for us. I think it would be kind of igniting of animal spirits that haven't been seen for a while in this country. So that's one discrete event. I think Europe -- one's got to be a little careful in describing Europe, but certainly in the last few months, we have seen kind of more points of light in Europe than we've seen for some period of time. Germany is the key element in Europe. But around Europe, including places like Spain, we started to see points of light. If Europe starts to find itself back on the economic growth path, I think again, that could be a potentially significant lift to us. I'd say the other discrete event that could again, fairly quickly change the mood for us to a more positive mood is that Australia actually started to make kind of recovery noises. Australia, for us, is -- kind has a disproportionate effect. Australia, on the E&C side, is a very well-developed market in spite of the relatively low population, they have a significant uptake of technology. And right now the picture there is fairly dismal. So we'll -- so I'd say in general, we're kind of operating at a baseline here, and that there is probably kind of statistically a possibility that as a few things start to improve, we're going to see the benefit on a worldwide basis. The rest of the world is probably okay as it is. We could see -- we'd like to see more growth out of Brazil. We'd like to see China on a little bit more of an unambiguous path but we're actually generating some pretty significant growth out of some these countries now and I think those are workable. But Europe, Australia and the Highway Bill are probably 3 discrete events that could make life significantly better for us in the next year.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay. And if I can fit in one last question on the ag side. It seems like there's some things like commodity prices that are pushing along this equipment and solutions ag cycle. I mean, should we think of Trimble as outperforming the equipment solutions cycle or outperforming on underperforming in line [ph]?
Steven W. Berglund: I would -- there's my historical answer, which I'm being careful about using at this point in time. So generally, I would say in agriculture, in a list off [ph] -- of a little bit of a better environment from a commodity price is I would generally expect us to outperform, simply because we're selling cost reduction, we're selling productivity. We're not selling capacity so I think historically, we've been fairly resistant to lift off [ph] the down cycle in ag, but I think the current mood, particularly in North America with some spillover into Europe, commodity price is just kind of depressed. So I would say kind of -- I would still expect us to outperform. But right now, we're struggling more than we have historically in kind of a down cycle.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten of Longbow.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Just a quick follow-up on when we talk about the drop in revenue between the second and third quarter, I think you mentioned statistically, when you look at it, it looks a lot bigger than, I guess, than what we're used to. Is that mostly in E&C and Advanced Devices, or is it pretty well spread across the thing? And the second thing, when we talk about the way profitability might change by sector given the change in volume that's going to take place.
Francois Delepine: Yes. So we don't really -- can't provide specific guidance by...
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: I'm not looking for precision, I'm just trying to look for -- get an idea of how it's coming -- you're taking 7.5% out of your volume in a timetable that's a little bit strange, so I just...
Francois Delepine: Yes, so again, you've got to -- I don't know if maybe you've missed the earlier comment, right. We had an event with the revenue recognition in Europe that essentially was a boost to Q2. And without that essentially, we would have been just about to the higher -- to the high end of our guidance for Q2. So if you take that out and look at Q2 to Q3 change, it's not as big of a drop as it seems. And I think we have...
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: That was within E&C, right?
Francois Delepine: What's that?
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: That was within E&C?
Francois Delepine: That was in Europe and about 90% of it was in E&C. A little bit of -- 90% of it.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: What does that do to the operating profitability, the 25% that we saw in that? I mean, did that drive -- what would the profitability have been normalized if we didn't have that boost?
Francois Delepine: I think on the total company, it's a little bit more than 0.5%.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: So they have in the total company. But what would the profitability of the Engineering and Construction sector have looked like? It came in at a very high number -- it's much higher than I think anybody expected it, 24% [ph]. What might have that number looked like as we talk about to -- probably in the mid...
Francois Delepine: We haven't done that exact math, but E&C is half of the company. So the impact would probably be double, about double in terms of...
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: So it'd be at least 1% or so. And therefore, when we look at the third quarter, are we looking at profitability going back down to low -- to the 20%, 21% level or can we come close to the adjusted number in the quarter?
Francois Delepine: I mean, we're -- we -- you can come back into [ph] our expectations from our EPS guidance on that. I mean, we're -- we have factored in our expectation the various impact that we had in Q2 and when we look at our forecast for Q3, we made some judgments and we have an EPS range that expresses that, if you will.
Steven W. Berglund: Eli, I would kind of urge against kind of this put and take, yes, the put and take. Yes, there was an effect in the second quarter for simply getting into the change of business we're getting into bigger wants here and there. So every quarter, there is a discrete effect. I would say it's fundamentally the second quarter stands on its own and I think, yes, there were some puts and takes there, but I would say is that fundamental performance was not drastically swung one way or the other by this -- by this effect in Europe. In reality, the effect -- the negative side of that effect it was an accumulation. So what we saw was a negative effect implicitly in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter. I don't think we saw the benefit in the third quarter. So I think it's just smoothed out so I'd advise against, let's call it a whole lot of kind of minute kind of puts and take here because...
Francois Delepine: Yes, it doesn't change the whole story. The only reason to call it out really is the kind of impact on the European growth rates and that was to explain the 20%. But other than that, it doesn't change the overall story.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And just as a follow up there, just on the Advanced Devices. Is that a sustainable rate that we're seeing or is it -- become more meaningful?
Francois Delepine: Yes, I think in the long term, we don't expect that business to certainly be a double-digit growth, but they have been doing pretty well. Not clear if we can repeat the performance in Q3 that we had in Q2. But that business has been going strong this year.
Operator: You're next question comes from the line of Brett Wong of Piper Jaffray.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: First, on the software subscription side of things. The mix kind of the declined in the first quarter and was flat this quarter, but you mentioned you expect the mix of software subscription to increase over time. What gives you confidence in that expectation?
Steven W. Berglund: Sorry, that didn't come through totally clearly, can you actually restate the question?
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Yes, sure. Sorry about that. Just wondering how your confidence or where you get your confidence in this expectation that the service and subscription revenue as a percent of the total is going to increase as we look forward giving that it declined in the first quarter and was flat this quarter.
Steven W. Berglund: Well, okay. First of all, I mean, the statement would be on a multiyear basis. So in any given quarter, given seasonal effects and whatever, so I think it's very potentially dangerous to kind of try to draw strategic judgments from what is happening in any given quarter. So I think that, certainly, in terms of level of activity, in terms of marketing activity, I think that, certainly, in a strategic sense, in a multiyear sense, is that yes, the confidence is quite strong. The model is occurring. I would actually say, okay, Brett, on a year-to-year basis, the trend is clear. And I would look in terms of quarter-to-quarter sequential effect, I would look to the seasonal effects of what business is strong in that quarter versus not strong in the quarter. So I think there's sort of arithmetic there. But certainly, our entire strategy, in terms of coming to market, is increasingly built on a bundle of value that does increase subscription and services. So yes, we're confident and I would actually say, okay, the year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year comparison is typically more reliable than a sequential comparison just given the seasonality of the business, plus the characterization, the SEC kind of defines how we report these particular categories and [indiscernible] software is -- can either be regard -- viewed as a product or it can be viewed as a service, depending on whether -- how it's being delivered and we're relatively indifferent in terms of how it's being delivered. We'll let the customer tell us how the customer wants it delivered. So some of these categories are a little arbitrary just in terms of what's happening in terms of the marketplace.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. On another note, can you provide any more specifics on the acquisition contribution in the quarter and how that compared to the contribution from a year ago?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think we more or less called it comparatively de minimis. If you look at the year-to-year increase, the significant majority of the revenue increase was significant majority, the profitability increase was organic. And the effects of acquisition were comparatively de minimis in terms of the growth, something on the order of 1 point or something like that might have been acquisition, all in.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. Thanks for participating. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Francois Delepine: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Lea Ann McNabb, you may begin your conference.
Lea Ann McNabb: Good afternoon. I'm here today with an Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Francois Delepine, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release, which is available, along with additional financial information on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. The first quarter included both disappointment and reassurance. The disappointment was focused almost exclusively on agriculture, which did not maintain the relatively strong growth we saw in the second half of 2013 and actually declined year-to-year against our expectation of growth for the quarter. On the other hand, most of the rest of the company's businesses exceeded the expectations we held at the beginning of the quarter. In aggregate, the other Trimble segments, excluding the Field Solutions segment, grew by over 14% year-over-year. Particularly encouraging was the growth in construction, core transportation and logistics and Geographic Information Systems. The other notable positive aspect of the quarter was the improvement in both the non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin as a percentage of revenue. This improvement occurred in spite of the decline in agriculture revenue, which carries strong operating margins. The non-GAAP operating margin for the 3 segments, excluding Field Solutions, grew by almost 40% year-to-year. The 16% year-to-year growth in the E&C segment was in spite of a market that remains constrained against historical standards. The catalog of constraints include Europe which while showing a few signs of life remains a weak construction market. The U.S. is showing signs of continuing improvement in commercial and residential construction, but Congress and the Administration have not resolved key infrastructure questions such as highway funding or the Keystone Pipeline. Effective action in these cases will produce meaningful benefits for our heavy civil and survey markets and to our results. Major international markets either remain in distress, such as Australia, or are drifting, such as Brazil. The reason for describing the current limitations of the E&C market is to make the point that the core construction business is growing more on the strength of penetration and less on the underlying strength of the market. We believe that technology is entering the mainstream and the multi-trillion dollar construction industry and that the rate of adoption is accelerating. We believe we also occupy a unique position in the construction market, with a portfolio of solutions that cover both the civil and building construction, and that can integrate both hardware and software across the entire workflow continuum. The response we've received at the CONEXPO tradeshow in the quarter validated this belief. While individual quarterly results for E&C will be lumpy given the uncertainties in the individual markets, we believe the secular trend for the construction market is stronger than at any point in our past. Subject to continuing qualifications about market conditions around the world, we expect a stronger 2014 market for E&C than we had in 2013. Currently, we are anticipating agriculture sales to stabilize in the second quarter, but given the surprises of the first quarter, we have been cautious in our outlook. Our issues in agriculture are primarily focused in North America although we are expecting to see a negative impact on revenue in Russia and Ukraine because of geopolitical uncertainties. The North America issues included weather for the second year in a row, which included drought conditions in the west and extremely wet conditions in much of the east, which kept farmers out of the field for much of what is usually a high activity period. In addition, the inventory of agricultural machines, both new and used, is running high, and we may be seeing more spillover into the market for agricultural technology than we originally anticipated. In addition, we may also be seeing some secondary effects from our strategic transition of the agriculture channel from a relative historical focus on hardware to a growing emphasis on solutions that enable data-driven decision making. This change of emphasis requires a remapping of skills and capabilities within the distribution channel onto the market, much as we have been implementing with the SITECH and building point construction distribution channels. The secular growth trend we are seeing in construction is mirrored in agriculture and reinforces the belief that the agricultural market can support double-digit growth over the long term. This next stage of growth in the agriculture technology market will be driven by a transition from a focus on vehicle guidance and control to a full integration of hardware, software and services that will maximize productivity across the entire farm. A specific example of this change in emphasis is our introduction of the Irrigate-IQ in the last 2 weeks. This release augments our past releases of variable rate control hardware and software, which have expanded the Connected Farm. Just as our construction business is migrating steadily away from a reliance on point technology solutions, agriculture is migrating towards whole farm modeling, which will balance input decisions, planting and fertilizing options and investments. This is the essence of our Connected Farm strategy in which we intend to provide a brand agnostic solution to allow the grower to plant, see and manage its total operation end-to-end. Our product portfolio of the future will consist of sensors, software applications, professional services with distribution partners playing a key role.  While it appears we may have been over optimistic on the revenue potential for agriculture in 2014, we believe the growth potential for the industry remains in place and that we can play a central role in the coming transformation. The other major Field Solutions element, Geographic Information Systems, had a strong growth in the quarter reversing the significant slide we had last year. The Mobile Solutions segment provided us with year-to-year revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong non-GAAP earnings growth. This result represents a mixed environment. The core of the segment is what we call transportation logistics, which accounts for roughly 3 quarters of the segment. These businesses grew revenue and earnings in double digits. The relative dregs in the business for field services, which was partially affected by delays in major contract awards, construction supply and public safety, which is only now beginning to recover from the 2009 meltdown of municipal and state finances. Within the Mobile Solutions segment, the rapidly improving health of the financial model allows us to more confidently emphasize growth. Growth in the segment will come from emphasizing enterprise solutions and geographical expansion as we continue to move away from track and trace functionality as the source of primary value. We are reinvesting some of the segment margin expansion back into accelerated R&D during 2014, which will begin to beneficially impact revenue growth in late 2014 and into 2015. The aggregate results for Trimble in the first quarter reflected a stumble against the improved standard we reestablished in the second half of 2013. This break in momentum is unfortunate because it camouflages what is occurring strategically. At the Analyst Day in June, we will be laying out our updated analysis of the market potential across Trimble's businesses and the actions required to realize that potential. This analysis produces a path to double-digit revenue growth for the long term. Part of this growth results from increased penetration of markets as they are currently defined. The rest is from the redefinition of markets that is made possible because of advances in technology. This redefinition provides us with an expanded role in a significantly larger market, which is substantially unpenetrated. The potential total market in our core areas of construction, agriculture, transportation and geospatial is well in excess of $25 billion, which we believe is currently around 25% penetrated. The core of our strategy will be to be the leader in the penetration of these markets and thereby, claim a disproportionate share of that future penetration. Although we're value add, we'll remain focused on a bundled hardware, software and services. Much, if not most of the expanded solutions set will be built around providing answers based on analytics associated with very large data sets and access through a SaaS solution. The physical implementation will then typically require a tight integration between the software solution and hardware. We look forward to providing a more extensive explanation on June 4. Let me turn the call over to Francois. Francois?
Francois Delepine: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. As Steve mentioned, this was a contrasted quarter with healthy growth in Engineering and Construction, Mobile Solutions and Advanced Devices offset by a challenging quarter in the Field Solutions segment. I'd like to remind you that unless otherwise noted, the operating results I will discuss will be on a non-GAAP basis. The reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers is available in our earnings press release, along with the financial data by segment. Unless otherwise indicated, growth rates are meant to be year-over-year growth rates. So let's now discuss the results for Q1 '14. Total revenue was $605 million revenue -- $605 million, up 9% year-over-year. As Steve discussed, we saw broad-based growth in the quarter with the exception of our agricultural business. Engineering and Construction grew by 16% with strength across the portfolio including Trimble buildings, heavy civil and survey. Field Solutions revenue was down 6% with agriculture revenue down single digits offset by double-digit growth in GIS revenue. Mobile Solutions grew 8% due primarily to higher revenue from transportation and logistics business units. Advanced Devices had a very strong quarter, growing 22% driven by strengths in several businesses in the portfolio. By geography, in the first quarter, 53% of revenue came from North America; 26% from Europe; 14% from Asia Pacific; and 7% from the rest of the world. Growth rate by region were 5% in North America; 15% in Europe, 11% in Asia Pacific; and 8% in the rest of world. The growth in North America came primarily from Engineering and Construction and Mobile Solutions, offset by a decline in Field Solutions. Europe saw growth in all segments despite a broad-based and sharp revenue drop in Russia. Asia Pacific returned to double-digit growth, thanks in part to more favorable conditions in Australia. The impact of foreign currency fluctuation in the quarter was slightly positive. Q1 gross margin was a record 57.7%, up 2.3 points over the first quarter of 2013 driven by ongoing cost and pricing discipline and the continued evolution in our portfolio towards more software, software maintenance and subscription services. Q1 operating expense was $220 million, or 36.4% of revenue, versus 35.5% during the first quarter of 2013 due primarily to the Field Solutions revenue mix. As a result of our continued strong gross margin performance, first quarter operating income increased 16.2% to $128.2 million or 21.2% of revenue as compared to $110.3 million or 19.8% of revenue in the first quarter of 2013. The effective income tax rate was 20% and it compares to 10% in Q1 2013. The first quarter of 2013 unusually low tax rate included a onetime retroactive adjustment for the 2012 R&D tax credit. Q1 net income was $102.6 million, which was up 5% as compared to Q1 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $0.39 compared with $0.38 in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year increase was negatively impacted by the difference in tax rates that I just mentioned. We finished the first quarter of 2014 with $165 million in cash. We paid down and reduced our debt by $94 million during the quarter, ending with $665 million of debt at the end of Q1 2014 versus $758 million at the end of Q4 2013. Cash flow from operation was solid at $83 million for Q1 '14 as compared to $37 million in Q1 '13. Note that cash flow can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. And as some of you will remember, Q1 '13 cash flow was unusually low driven by higher working capital needs. At the end of Q1, accounts receivable was $398 million and day sales outstanding was 60 days as compared to 55 days at the end of Q4 2013 and 64 days at the end of Q1 2013. We're pleased with the overall quality of our AR portfolio. Q1 ending inventory was $267 million compared to $254 million at the end of Q4 2013 and $261 million at the end of Q1 last year. I will now turn to our guidance for the second quarter of 2014. We expect revenue to be between $605 million and $630 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.22 to $0.26 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.42. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $37 million related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $4 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $11 million. Q2 2014 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assume a 20% to 22% tax rate and approximately 265 million shares outstanding. Before I close, I'm glad to announce the appointment of Jim Todd to the role of Investor Relations Director, filling in the position left back by Willa McManmon when she left the company in February this year. I'll also take this opportunity to thank Lea Ann McNabb who very competently covered the key IR duties during that transition period. Jim has been with Trimble for 7 years, and he understands our business and the industry. During that time, he's led finance for our Engineering and Construction segment, and most recently, our Mobile Solutions segment. Jim has also played a key role in Trimble's mergers and acquisition program. I also want to confirm that Trimble will be hosting an Investor Day on June 4 in Westminster, Colorado from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and I hope you can join us. Events will be webcast and will include presentations by members of the Trimble leadership team. Additional details regarding agenda and logistics will be posted shortly on our Investor Relations website. With that, we'll now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to get a little bit more detail in terms of the agriculture business. Can you maybe walk us through some of the potential swing factors that you see both near term and what you see supporting the longer-term double-digit growth just given some of the headwinds that we're seeing in terms of machinery?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So obviously, we were surprised in the first quarter that third quarter and fourth quarter last year were -- it appeared to be giving us a trend. And things did change in the first quarter. So I'd say weather, I hate to use this for the second year in a row, but weather did have a reasonably significant impact on results. So that was one thing not recurring. The question is whether we are able to make up the difference during the second quarter, but weather, without a doubt, particularly in North America, pushed -- in the case of the east, pushed the buying season late in the year. And in places like the Central Valley of California, the question of drought is whether there is any -- whether there's going to be any recovery this year. So that creates -- created an effect in the first quarter and creates some level of uncertainty in the second quarter. Russia, overall, for the company, accounted in terms of the midst of the low end of the revenue, Russia accounted for the majority of the shortfall overall at the company level, and has the potential to affect agriculture results here in the short term. Certainly hard to quantify. It all depends on how things play out, but certainly, right now, in Russia and Ukraine, both of which are relatively growing areas for us in agriculture. And people are obviously distracted at this point in time. And then I think that the relative equipment overhang, which we did not expect to be a principal factor for us coming into the year. Again, the thesis here, which has proved out to be true in the past, is that we're selling ROI, if you will. We're selling cost reduction. We're not selling capacity. And so our belief coming into the year was that we would be able to kind of sell into the marketplace in spite of kind of the overhang of the market in terms of equipment. That turned out to be not as true as we expected it to be. Now we've seen episodes like this in the past that have been comparatively short where the farm psychology kind of goes into a funk, if you will, for a period of time. And farmers hold back on their spending, which splashes over onto us, and then revise. So we don't know whether that will happen again but certainly, it adds the uncertainty. So I think that there are a number of factors there. The one that I brought up that is maybe harder to put a number around, but we are engaged with the distribution channel at this point in time, and talking about, let's call it, new generations of product that are coming, which are much more software and data focused. And the channel is a little -- is grappling with that change, and whether that had any effect on the short-term results or not is really hard to identify, but there is some level of uncertainty in the channel that may have had some operational effect on us in the quarter. So again, the uncertainties are pretty much North American. The rest of the world has variable performance but the issues are primarily North American, they're not global for us. And I think it's more a matter of uncertainty here in the short term. Longer term, I think, again, the drivers that have been there all along are still the drivers in the multi-year perspective in terms of fundamentally a -- in growing need for food, rising living standards in places like China and therefore, putting more demand on -- raising the expectations on agriculture. All those are still there. And again, our fundamental belief, as a company, is that both construction and agriculture are going to go through another technology -- or fundamental technology transformation based on the availability of data, and we are planning on participating in that. So I think that our longer-term view at the moment is probably clearer than our short-term or the next quarter sort of view.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Fair enough. And just as a follow-up, you talked about potentially the second half being stronger than the first half. Just given your prior commentary around full year growth rates, I mean, clearly, it looks like it's a little bit more challenged at this point. How should we think about sort of the second half ramp, and what would you guys be sort of comfortable with in terms of those expectations?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. I think, actually, it's kind of a -- there's a need to bifurcate the question at this point in time. So I think that relative to everything outside of agriculture, I'd say virtually all of the businesses outside of agriculture are fundamentally in stronger shape today than they were 1 year ago. More market certainty, market hasn't necessarily improved all that much year-to-year but I think there's more market certainty. There is a higher level of confidence on our part to be able to execute. We're sitting, I think, in a number of cases, on a stronger product portfolio. So I would say everything other than agriculture is, I would say, the second half of the year, looks better fundamentally than 2013 second half. And again, I'm expressing uncertainty relative to agriculture, so I'd say it's a little bit of a bifurcated world. And I'd hate to name a number, in fact, I don't think we named a number per se, but I think that depending on agriculture, the second half of the year, in some ways, should -- outside of agriculture, should be better than 2013 overall. And then I think it's all a matter of agriculture, and on that one, I think, we're expressing some uncertainty at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cox of Piper Jaffray.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I was wondering if you could comment on the equity sale of the virtual site solutions that's part of one of your adjustments.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Francois can maybe be a little bit more explicit. But we announced early in the year a revised arrangement with Caterpillar. And one of the elements of that was that the VirtualSite Solutions joint venture, which was established in October 2008, VSS for short, Trimble had a 65% interest in that and Caterpillar had a 35% interest. VSS was primarily created to put, if you will, the machine in the context of the construction site. The original joint venture, known as CTCT, was formed in 2002 and was really focused on onboard machine controls. So what we did was we sold 15% of the joint venture to -- back to Caterpillar, so it's now a 50-50 venture. And there were a number of other elements. But the theme of that press release and the theme of the agreement was, really, to expand the ambition set of the joint venture into what we're calling the unified fleet. Basically, a technology solution for the entire construction site that is, if you will, equipment brand agnostic. And so that was the center of the arrangement with Caterpillar that was announced earlier this year. A part of that was kind of in the spirit of the collaboration between the 2 companies was to take this joint venture back to 50-50.
Francois Delepine: Yes. And just to kind of add on the financial impact. Part of that sale of this 15% included a -- recognizing a $15 million gain. That portion which is included in the GAAP income, but excluded from the non-GAAP income. And because that had also a big impact on the tax rate, you'll see that we also have the GAAP tax rate of 23%, which is higher than the non-GAAP tax rate that was used of 20%.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: That's helpful. And I'm surprised to hear Russia can be such a big swing factor in the quarter and if I look at Europe, Asia Pacific, both growing double digits, I guess, you can only assume that Russia's incorporated into your rest of the world. But could you frame up the...
Steven W. Berglund: Well, it's not necessarily a big number. But with the range we've given on revenue was $610 million to $630 million, we were $605 million, so we were below the bottom end of the range. And between the weather and Russia, if those 2 things hadn't happened, I believe we would have been in the range. But -- so it's not a huge number, it's not actually material. But when you're talking about net change, it was what's called a factor of irritation. But I think the -- part of the issues for agriculture, if you look at the growth markets, I would declare China to be one of them. It's still small but growing at a very rapid rate. I would say Eastern Europe in general, but certainly Ukraine and Russia fall into that category of -- yes, starting from relatively low numbers but with the potential for generating significant double-digit growth. And so it's unfortunate that probably for the time being, kind of Ukraine and Russia are maybe on the sidelines a little bit in terms of being able to get the -- to realize our potential, both in agriculture and some of the other businesses in Russia.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And one quick one, I guess, maybe this is for the Analyst Day. But as you move more into software and precision ag, this is a crowded space. There's a lot of big players introducing software solutions. How do you feel like your position to win in that category?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. But I -- fair question. I think, it's right now very much of a jump ball market. In fact, the market, as everybody is describing it, doesn't exist at this point in time. We're all, in some sense, selling a degree of futureware here. I think the relative Trimble advantages, if you will, against some players with a bigger balance sheet, it's, first of all, in terms of understanding what's going on in the farm. We're already there in a fairly practical sense. So we've been doing guidance there. We've been doing elements of the Connected Farm there in terms of variable rate. So we've got the sensor side on the front end, we've got the sensor side on the back end. We're very comfortable in what's called [ph] the big data realm. We're already tracking close to 2 million things around the world. So we're very comfortable in terms of the mobile space and kind of the big data realm. So we bring a lot to the party. I think it really is something of a test in terms of, okay, who can accumulate all the elements of the solution and bring them successfully with an effective go-to-market strategy, to bring it directly to the farmer. So I think all of us who are claiming some degree of ownership of the market have a number of questions to answer. But I think it's still very much early days and the market needs to warm up. And again, yes, we'd be happy to kind of explore it in more detail at the -- on June 4.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing of MKM Partners.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Yes. A couple more questions on ag here. You talked about inventory running high. Could you give us a sense of how many weeks and how long it takes to work down, I believe. Historically, you've talked about maybe 2 weeks in the channel, just not too much inventory.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. I think I've probably, in some sense, led people to the wrong conclusion. I was talking less about our inventory in the channel. I don't think we're particularly overhung in the channel. The reference and that was probably not clear was basically to the big equipment that's in the channel is, I think, the equipment market -- big equipment market is overhung at this point in time, and that's created a fair amount of confusion and kind of pushback from the market. And it's easier for us when equipment is moving and so that took -- that's made it a more difficult situation for us. But I'm not referring to our inventory being overhung in the channel but the big ticket items.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay. But there's no sense of how many weeks. I think, historically, you've talked about 2 weeks maybe of retailers and resellers? Or...
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. I don't know what the number is. But I have no belief that we're anything other than in kind of normal levels in the channel.
Francois Delepine: Yes, that's -- I checked with the team and they confirmed that as well, yes.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I think you did a good job explaining some of the factors impacting ag right now, weather and channel education. I guess, you're still guiding somewhat conservatively. I mean, you talked about your products being still pretty competitive in big data. Is there anything else happening? Maybe anything changing in terms of demand for ROI solutions or customers...
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. I mean, I think that what we're seeing here, if we're going to be more specific, I'll wait for the better forum which would be Investors Day in June, I think. But what we're seeing is -- yes, starting from a low base, but what we're seeing is a relatively rapid uptake in terms of kind of sequentially fairly impressive growth from quarter-to-quarter. So I think the market is stirring, the technology is beginning to move into the market. I mentioned this Irrigate-IQ product that we announced here in the U.S. within the last couple of weeks. That, for example, we may see some lift in the second half of the year from just that introduction because this is bringing new capability in terms of being able to manage irrigation and water use. So I think that there's an uptake. I think that, really, in terms of the short term, it's not going to swing our results here in 2014 context. But I think the uptake is growing. I think that there are -- again, I think that there are going to be a lot of issues for everyone participating in this agricultural next wave technology is the go-to-market aspects are going to be as important and conceivably more important than just the raw technologies and the capabilities. Is getting -- educating the farmer, building trust with the farmer, all of those sorts of things are going to be as important as any other factor here. And I think those are the -- that's the element that's easy to ignore. But I think it's absolutely going to be key. And that's going to take some time. That's not going to happen overnight. This is not going [ph] to be a consumer sort of product. So -- but I think that we've got a relatively continuous flow of new product, new features going to the field. And again, we're feeling comparatively good about the relative uptake. It's just not big enough yet to kind of offset these other market forces that we encountered in the first quarter.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: If I could fit one more in. Question for Francois, you've been here maybe, what, 5 or 6 months now? And maybe you can compare and contrast Trimble's software business with your prior experiences at places like VMware, maybe in terms of target operating model, deferred bookings, mix of subscription and services. Just what's similar, what's the difference.
Francois Delepine: Yes, actually this is -- I think this is -- today's my fourth month anniversary. But I mean, obviously, the target customer and the types of solution that VMware is selling. VMware was really a pure-play software business that's selling into IT, very infrastructure driven. So kind of very, very different. I think what I see here is that software, which is part of the offering, see which solution that typically have a component of a hardware, software, we don't have much services yet but we're building that. In terms of deferred, if you look at the growth year-over-year, in deferred, if you look at the end of Q1 '13 to the end of Q1 '14, I think the deferred balance grew by 16% between those 2 points. And during that time, our revenue growth was probably more in the 10% range, on average. So you can see that it's starting to pick up steam, it's becoming a little bit more, a bigger part of our overall mix but it's kind of a slow and steady process as opposed to kind of radical process at this point. And again, because the focus is on providing the full solution. Is that helpful?
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Yes. That's helpful. Deferred bookings growing faster than revenues so far. So that's a positive.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea James of Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: This is just -- I guess, I'm trying to understand the business. How did you determine the valuation of the equity sale back to Caterpillar in Q1?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, let's just say it was not a linear sort of a process. Is the $15 million, I suppose, for 15% would lead you to a conclusion in terms of the valuation. But in reality, there was a relatively rich set of economics. In terms of coming to a specific number, we did use an outside valuation. So we brought in outsiders to do the valuation. But in terms of the relative level of collaboration between the 2 organizations and the nature of the relationship between the organization in terms of factory fit items and all of that, there was a, let's call it a comprehensive view on the set of economics. But as far as the point valuation of the entity, we did bring in an outsider to make both sides feel comfortable that we were coming to an objective answer.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: And then, it seems like the inventory you're talking about with the large machinery, they have a machinery in the ag channel. It's going to take a while for all of that to work through. And I was just wondering, I don't know, do you kind of look forward to 2015? I know it's kind of a far away out, but you already started talking longer term. Do you think there could be a headwind on 2015 as well?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. I mean, I think potentially for the entire agriculture market. And -- but I would still -- obviously, I'm not as compelling today as I might have been 3 months ago on making this argument, but I would argue that, okay, in terms of let's call it, the cyclicality of agriculture, the cyclicality of construction, for that matter. Okay, we're exposed to it, we're not necessarily relatively total victims. So we do have the ability to sell solutions onto an existing fleet of machines. So if, for example, and I can't -- or probably won't quantify this all that particularly. But for example, we have tens of thousands of low-end guidance systems on farm equipment around the world. There is some reasonable possibility for going -- revisiting those same farmers and -- who've been educated on the low-end system and upgrading them to the full guidance system, for example. So I think that there may very well -- I'll leave it to the macro -- or the economist to kind of make their judgments on the overall agriculture market. And again, our problems are pretty much focused in North America, we're not seeing the same issues outside of North America. But -- so there could very well be headwinds for agriculture, in general, into 2015. But I think we have a reasonable ability as a company to, at least, resist those kind of macro headwinds, and I think there are any number of things we can do. And I think that I'm not just looking forward to the 2015. I'm hoping to look forward to the second half of 2014 on that as well. But again, I think that we were surprised in the first quarter, I think we're being cautious in the second quarter, but I think things will become clearer as we get deeper into the second quarter. So I'm not writing off 2014 for agriculture quite yet.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: And really just quickly, just because you're doing the Analyst Day on a different day, normally it's at the Dimension Conference. Is there going to be a change to the Dimension Conference or this is just the timing that has to do with the Analyst Day kind of thing?
Steven W. Berglund: No, I think the 2 events are independent in our view. We'll see what we do relative to investors with Dimensions. We're expecting quite a capacity problem so -- at Dimensions, given the venue. So I think it was our view that we wanted to have a kind of enough time to fully present the story and the June date seemed to be the right time to do it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM partners.
Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Just in E&C, second quarter in a row, pretty good commentary on improvement and optimism and construction. So how sustained is that for the rest of the year as contractors get back to work, are there any potential disruptions?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think -- I mean, again, I think we've got to express a certain amount of qualification is that in terms -- I won't call the U.S. market robust, we're far from robust. But the U.S. market is really the only market that is showing kind of decent fundamentals relative to construction. The rest of the world is either kind of relatively poor, Australia still being in that mode. Europe still being in that mode, by and large. And so I think it may be a little bumpy just because there isn't a whole lot of tailwind from the economic perspective. But again, I think, that what we are seeing is an accelerating, embrace of the technology by contractors worldwide, so I think that we're on a secular path here that's somewhat, in spite of the economic environment and I would expect that to continue through the rest of this year and into next year. Obviously if, for example, Australia came and started showing some economic life, that will be a net plus to us, same would be true in Europe. So I think there are probably implicitly more upsides than there are downsides, although I'm sure there are some -- if some of these economies started to have difficulties we can see a slowdown. So I think it could be kind of a lumpy into the second half of this year, into 2015, for that matter, just given the state of economics. But I think a fundamental secular path is comparatively strong because technology is penetrating the market and we would expect that to continue. So I'd basically be fairly comfortable with the relative tone we're setting subject to those qualifications and would say if the economic environment improves, there could actually be some lift.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Steve, could you just speak for a minute or 2, on the mobile side of the business. The Field Services piece of the business, you had mentioned still was beginning to recover or fairly soft. Is the prospects and the visibility there better as the year unfolds that we can see some added growth from that portion of Mobile?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I think that within Field Services, which is now perhaps is now a -- kind of a minority element to the Mobile Solutions segment behind the Transportation & Logistics elements, which account for about 75% of it. I think that we have been taking a specific strategic path, which is aimed at the enterprise level customers. So I think, increasingly, the book of business as well as the pipeline are major accounts. And kind of names that you would instantly recognize, but because they don't like press releases, we don't get to talk about much. So I think the issue in Field Services, as much as anything else, is that, that tends to be a relatively long development cycle in terms of the sales process but because we're talking about fundamentally changing the way relatively a large enterprise does business and okay, that can take 1 year or 2 before it has worked through the process because it is so mission-critical. So I think certainly, in the first quarter that is part -- elements of pipeline that we thought were going to actually turn into revenue, got the way not -- did not disappear but simply got delayed. And so that business is that it's a lumpy. So I'd say longer term, it will be a growth business, but at the moment, it is waiting for some of these larger orders to come about. So...
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Can I just -- also, just sticking with Mobile for a minute or 2. When I look at the op profit there, certainly a very positive year-over-year performance. But I'm a little bit curious, just seasonally, as we move from the fourth quarter into the first, is the decremental seasonally, which was relatively high at the EBIT line. Is that just -- is that mix or is that seasonality? Some costs in the first quarter versus the fourth or -- I'm surprised a little bit.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I think there are seasonal -- they tell me that there's seasonal elements in the Mobile business, and Transportation and Logistics that there are seasonal elements. Compared to construction or agriculture, they're relatively mild seasonal flows. I think, to some extent, what you're seeing at the margin line is when some of these purchase accounting effects for some of the acquisition start to come off, you're starting to see the more peer-based line come through. So some of this is likely the accounting but I think what you're beginning to see is the underlying baseline of what the business is capable of producing going forward.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And just one last clarification. As you walk through the ag piece of the business and just Field Solutions, in general. Obviously, no real visibility here short term but the commentary was still around the second quarter being better than the first. But comparisons get pretty easy. I mean, are you basically kind of suggesting that the possibility for growth in the second half is still there? Or I'm just trying to clarify your comments.
Steven W. Berglund: I think the range of possibilities at the moment, given the level of uncertainty is wider than it would be historically. So I think, I can give -- I could -- given the performance in the first quarter, I think we got -- I think we've pounded the stake in at the, let's call it the conservative end of the range. And I think that this business historically has shown some propensity to surprise to the upside. So I think the way I'd like to leave it is that the range of possibilities is comparatively wide at this point in time. But it's -- I'm not sure that we're willing to peg -- pound the stake in at anything other than the conservative element of the range at this point, until we better understand what's going on.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: The median of the range is 0 though?
Steven W. Berglund: In terms of growth?
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, second half.
Steven W. Berglund: You're pushing me here, but let's just say that wouldn't be an unreasonable starting point to consider but again, I'll qualify...
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I understand. Okay. I just want to make sure the range did span the positive side of things.
Operator: Your next question comes from the Andrew Spinola of Wells Fargo.
Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on the prior question about Mobile Solutions. Steve, I know you had commented in Q4 that there were some revenue recognition benefits in that quarter and then this quarter, it sort of looks like a more normal quarter. And just wondering what you think, now that we've seen a lot of the M&A kind of annualized, what do you think this business can grow over the midterm?
Steven W. Berglund: I think the -- okay, relative to Transportation and Logistics, which accounts for 75% of the segment, focusing on that has been the key driver, and then the other elements are interesting but require a longer story. I think, in terms of Transportation and Logistics, certainly, our long-term expectation in terms of being -- taking people net together with ALK, together with TMW and crafting out of those elements, let's call it a pretty comprehensive enterprise solution for the transportation company. I think that our longer-term -- our long-term view certainly is, let's call it double digits, something greater than -- for 10% in the long-term. I think we're in a -- to better tie those elements together, to work towards the enterprise solution that covers both the mobile element of the workflow as well as the enterprise level what's occurring back at the enterprise, tying those together, we're investing this year in terms of product solution, to better tie those 2 elements together. And I think 2015 is going to be the year that receives the benefits of that investment this year. But I think from a strategic standpoint, it is -- the expectation is fundamentally doubled -- double-digit, both for the T&L and, really, for the segment. And I think that the full strategy doesn't necessarily unfold on that until end of 2015 when we have, let's call it the full product capability.
Francois Delepine: I'm just going to add -- just to add one comment on the -- your Q4 question or observation. We did have some benefits from the 14th week into the subscription business that showed in revenues. That's the best way to look at it is, really, year-over-year.
Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just one other question for me. The Advanced Devices segment has become a pretty big swing from quarter-to-quarter. And I'm just wondering maybe you can shed a little light on the strength this quarter. And maybe even more importantly, what we should think about modeling going forward for both revenue and margin in that segment?
Steven W. Berglund: In Mobile?
Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Advanced Devices.
Steven W. Berglund: Advanced Devices. Again, I think that -- okay, on a strategic basis, it's -- we don't view it as being a let's call it a significant growth driver for the company as it's constituted at this point in time. Of course, they keep surprising me to the upside on that and kind of keep making me a little bit of a liar. But I think that -- I'd say our growth ambitions in that segment aren't -- or let's call it, single-digit growth expectations. And the segment, to a large extent, depending on how we reflect the revenue sharing, elements of that segment, particularly ThingMagic, the RFID capability with Applanix, which is sensors but -- inertial sensors primarily, those are enablers for large parts of the rest of the Trimble. So they will grow based on the success from the end users market such as construction and geospatial. But I would say, generally, is if you take the 12 month financial model and apply that to a relatively modest single-digit growth factor, you probably -- that's probably, I think the way to view that business strategically. We'll let you know if our ambitions increase.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrea James from Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: I was just wondering if you could talk about your drone offering in the international markets and just how that's gaining traction. Just because drones have been so much in the news and I guess, that's one of your better kept secrets, that you have a drone yourself.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. We build airplanes. Yes, and the issue with drones are more particularly UAVs or any of the other nomenclatures. Yes, we can't fly them in the U.S. The FAA is still pondering the issue. And I think that elsewhere, okay, we are getting some traction. I think the whole issue of UAVs are getting a lot of attention and okay, there are a lot of potential applications out there. But I think that, to some extent, at this moment in time, we believe in the technology, certainly long term. But to some extent at this point in time, is still the solution in search of the problem. I think the places where we would expect the growth to come would be, first of all, on geospatial using drones outfitted with sensors to do a lot of what surveyors are currently doing, whether it's in the mines or whether it's determining volumes of -- piles of aggregate or looking for feature extraction or measurements from a survey standpoint. So our principal rationale for buying into the UAVs was in the geospatial realm basically as an augmentation to kind of conventional surveying. And the other, I think, with a great deal of potential in the future's agriculture. And again, it's a matter of getting the right sensors on the airplane to actually create the right solution for the right application and to monetize it. So again, the fact that we're not talking about it in kind of the mainstream results is that it's still relatively small, I think. But with a lot of potential, and I would say -- but that's kind of a 2 or 3 year story that's still unfolding and that there's a fair amount of development work that has to occur before we start talking about it regularly.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven W. Berglund: In that case, thank you for attending. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Francois Delepine: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-02-11 16:30:00) =====

Operator:  Good afternoon. My name is [Alisha] (ph), and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2013 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. Willa McManmon, you may begin your conference.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, CEO; Francois Delepine, our new CFO; and Julie Shepard, Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the Company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release which is available along with additional financial information on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund:  Good afternoon. Our results in the fourth quarter both reaffirmed the [indiscernible] we discussed after the third quarter and also tends to reinforce the growth outlook for 2014. However, that view does need to continue to be conditioned in inconsistent market conditions in multiple regions, deferrals of investments due to continuing economic uncertainty and continuing constraints around government funding sources. Year-over-year revenue growth of over 16% exceeded the range of expected outcomes we held at the beginning of the quarter. This overachievement resulted from better performance in the E&C, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions segment. Positive market forces that lifted the quarter included to continuing strengthening of residential and commercial construction in the U.S., growth in survey instruments, and double-digit year-to-year growth in agriculture. In addition, when we established the expectations for the quarter, we identified three discrete effects that had the potential to positively move the needle for us if they were to fall within the quarter. As it turns out, only one of the three did occur. The other two effects will play out over 2014. The quality of the financial model also continues to improve with the year-over-year increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin. For the entire fiscal year 2013, non-GAAP gross margin increased by 1.9 points and non-GAAP operating margin by 1.2 points. These improvements reflect the evolution of the revenue mix towards [indiscernible] hardware-software and services. The E&C segment reflected relatively strong growth in a market that remains muted. The strongest single point of residence in the segment is U.S. residential and commercial construction market. For the civil, while continuing to grow is being challenged by the combined effects of Australian recession, the lack of European investment and the absence of a solution to U.S. Highway funding. Survey instruments, the other significant product category in the segment, has stabilized and is producing growth which we are expecting to continue into 2014. Overall, the E&C market appears to be firmer than it was in 2013 and should present upside opportunities in 2014 compared to 2013. Within E&C, there were two meaningful press releases in early January announcing the expansion of relationships with AECOM and Caterpillar. The AECOM announcement is significant in that it was for a suite of Trimble capabilities and emphasizes the evolution of Trimble's offerings from point solutions into a more comprehensive enterprise solution. That Caterpillar release announced an updated agreement between Trimble and Caterpillar that makes the concept of unified fleet central to our efforts. The unified fleet initiative is intended to make the basic technology solutions for the contractor equipment brand agnostic thereby allowing the contractor to operate the entire equipment seamlessly. The other point of emphasis in the Caterpillar release is the heightened emphasis on making Trimble SITECH channel a premier channel for bringing technology to construction. Field Solutions low growth year-to-year reflected a combination of double-digit growth in agriculture coupled with another sharp drop in GIS. The performance of agriculture in the fourth quarter reinforced the belief that we have the task to grow agriculture in 2014 in spite of challenges in the overall market. This belief is based on the addition of new product categories, new product introductions and penetration in non-traditional markets. Over the last several years, agriculture has become much more diverse internationally and mostly kind of on North America. The prime case in point is Europe which grew by more than 30% in 2013. We believe GIS touched bottom in the fourth quarter and that we will see some growth beginning in the first quarter. While we anticipate a long term strategic shift in the volumes of GIS sales from hardware to software, we do not believe this transition was a significant factor in 2013 performance. Instead, the relatively dismal performance resulted primarily from the cut-back of traditional government funding sources. With stronger growth in agriculture combined with the switch of GIS from [indiscernible] to contributor, our expectation is that we will see Field Solutions provide upside opportunities in 2014 compared to 2013. The Mobile Solutions segment continued to demonstrate strong year-to-year revenue growth with significant growth coming from acquisition effects. The particular point of encouragement in this segment increasing the segment non-GAAP operating margin was over 18% of revenue in the quarter and 14.6% for the year. With the rapidly improving health of the financial model, we can more confidently emphasize growth. Growth in the segment will come from emphasizing enterprise solutions and geographic expansion as we continue to move away from [indiscernible] functionality as the source of primary value. With acquisitions largely disappearing in the first quarter, revenue growth will moderate in 2014. While the segment will produce growth roughly consistent with the total Company during 2014, we expect it will demonstrate continued incremental improvements in margins. We'll also reinvest some of the segment margin expansion back into accelerated R&D during 2014 which will begin to beneficially impacted revenue growth in late 2014 and into 2015. Last quarter we said our general view that we would see a step-up in Trimble's organic growth in 2014 from the level we saw in 2013 without any material help from the economy. This implies that the combined organic and inorganic effects that produced double-digit revenue growth. While the fourth quarter results tended to reaffirm this view, the step-up in the quarter should be regarded as indicative of increased stability but not necessarily as a new baseline. The 2014 environment remains highly ambiguous and challenging to predict and requires us to be both cautious and disciplined. More important than the short-term results are the continuing signs that our strategic initiatives are being validated in the construction, agriculture and transportation and logistics market. Our key theme for 2014 will be to accelerate the strategic [indiscernible] in these three areas by integrating capabilities we have assembled into a combination that is compelling for our enterprise users. The two key elements of this are intensified innovation and the development of the go-to-market capabilities. Let me turn the call over to Francois Delepine, our new CFO. Francois joined us at the beginning of January from VMware. He has spent his career in the Silicon Valley and has worked in finance in many of the iconic names including Google and Apple. His vast exposure to software and services should help us in the continuing evolution of Trimble. Francois?
Francois Delepine: Thank you, Steven. Good afternoon, everyone. As Steve mentioned, I joined the Company five weeks ago on January 6. I'm now on a steep learning curve and I'm delighted to be a part of Trimble. I see a lot of potential and together with Steve's team, I'm eager to make the next stage of Trimble's growth happen. I also look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. I'm pleased to kick off my first conference call following a solid quarter. At a high level, the key financial highlights of both the fourth quarter and 2013 are reflective of bigger trends within the Company. This includes the growth of revenue from integrated solutions, focus across the enterprise, whether it's the construction sites, the farm or the street. The solutions are increasingly hybrid and combine hardware, software and services and subscription. These hybrid solutions come with higher gross margins which have enabled us to increase our operating margins. Today I'll discuss the fourth quarter 2013 and our year-end results on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP results as well as the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP are available in our earnings press release along with financial data by segment. With that, let me first cover the fourth quarter 2013 results and then move on to the full year. Q4 total revenue was $599 million, up 16% year-over-year, representing an improvement from the first nine months of the year. Fourth quarter growth was driven primarily by broad-based strength in Engineering and Construction including revenue recognized from the discrete items that Steve mentioned. We're also pleased by our growth in the transportation and logistics business within Mobile Solutions. Field Solutions grew by 3% year-over-year with revenue from agriculture growing at a double-digit offset by weakness in GIS sales. By geography, 55% of Q4 revenue came from North America, 24% from Europe, 13% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from the rest of the world. Year-over-year growth rate by region were 18% in North America, 27% in Europe, 4% in Asia-Pacific and 2% in the rest of the world. The growth in North America came primarily from Engineering and Construction and Mobile Solutions. Europe saw growth in all segments, particularly in Engineering and Construction and Agriculture. Asia-Pacific remained relatively soft with continued weak conditions in Australia. The impact of foreign currency fluctuation was small in the fourth quarter with approximately $4 million [indiscernible] on revenue and no material impact on operating income. Q4 gross margin was a record 57%, about 3.3 points over the fourth quarter of last year as a result of richer bundles as Steve mentioned. Q4 operating expense was $216 million or 36.1% of revenue, down 1.1 points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. As a result of our strong gross margin and operating expense performance, Q4 operating income was $125 million or 20.9% of revenue as compared to $85 million or 16.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012. The effective income tax rate was 10% versus 16% in Q4 2012 and mainly due to discrete items as well as the geographical mix of earnings. Q4 net income was $114 million which was up 55% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Diluted earnings per share were $0.43 compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in the fourth quarter of 2012. Turning now to the full year results, total revenue was $2.29 billion, up 12% versus 2012. While the full year revenue growth did not meet the expectation that we discussed at the beginning of the year, we are relatively pleased with how we exited the year. By geography for the year, 55% of revenue came from North America, 23% from Europe, 14% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from the rest of the world. Year-over-year, North America was up 16%, Europe was up 17%, and Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world were each down 1%. Asia-Pacific was down primarily due to the recession in Australia which is impacting infrastructure spending and hence the sales of our Engineering and Construction Solutions within the region. For the year, foreign currency fluctuation impact was again relatively small, it is approximately $11 million [indiscernible] on revenue and no material impact on operating income. 2013 gross margin was 56.4%, up 1.9 points as compared to 2012. 2013 operating expense was $816 million or 35.7% of revenue, up slightly as compared to 35% of revenue in 2012 due primarily to acquisitions. Going forward we'll continue to invest in our innovation through R&D and expect to gradually improve operating leverage and sales and marketing and G&A as we grow the top line. 2013 operating income was $474 million or 20.7% of revenue as compared to $397 million or 19.5% of revenue in 2012, an improvement of 120 basis points. The effective income tax rate for 2013 was 14% as compared to 17% in 2012, primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings and the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit which occurred in the first quarter and included a retroactive effect for 2012. 2013 net income of $412 million was up 21%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.58 compared with diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in 2012, an increase of 20%. We finished 2013 with $147 million in cash, we paid down $51 million in debt during Q4 resulting in $758 million of debt at the end of 2013 versus $911 million at the end of 2012. The net debt was $611 million, down from $687 million at the end of the third quarter of 2013. Cash flow from operations was $136 million for Q4 2013 as compared to $97 million in Q4 2012 and $415 million for the full-year 2013 as compared to $341 million for the full-year of 2012. At the end of Q4, accounts receivable were $338 million and day sales outstanding was 55 days as compared to 59 days at the end of Q3 2013 and 57 days at the end of Q4 last year. Q4 ending inventory was $254 million compared to $242 million at the end of third quarter of 2013 and $241 million at the end of Q4 last year. And we now turn to our guidance for Q1 '14 and we provide a range for revenue as well as for GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS. We expect Q1 2014 revenue to be between $610 million and $630 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.26 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.43. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $40 million related to previous acquisitions, estimated acquisition cost of $3 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $10 million. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance assume a 19% to 21% tax rate and 264 million shares outstanding. The relatively higher tax rate is primarily due to the expectation of a larger contribution from the U.S. income taxed at a higher rate and the expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Note that if reinstated, as it has been historically, the U.S. R&D tax credit could reduce the tax rate by 1 to 2 points. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Cox.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Congrats on a nice quarter. My first question is on the gross margin, we have now two consecutive quarters above 53% on a GAAP basis and we have seen an uptick here in software and service, this bundled revenue strategy, is that run rate for gross margin something that we should start to expect going forward or is there something abnormal here in the back half of 2013 that caused it to spike up?
Steven W. Berglund: I think it leads to an order of approximation. I think our fundamental view is to have kind of the gross margins at this level that you're seeing, not necessarily tied to any particular quarter, but this higher run rate of gross margin, there is no structural reason why it should come down. I think maybe the fourth quarter for special reasons was maybe a little bit elevated but kind of blending the third and fourth quarter together, I think you start to get something close to what I would call the structural gross margin going forward. Again gross margin will be heavily dependent upon product mix, so it will bounce around a bit, but I think what you see is likely what you're going to get going forward. So I guess I would caution against assuming that the upward trend will continue but I think our view going forward is that gross margins around this level are relatively bankable going forward subject to kind of a change in mix of business.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Okay, that's very helpful. And I don't believe you specifically addressed the growth expectation in Ag for 2014 but correct me if I'm wrong, on the last call I know you said double-digit growth in Ag, but against the backdrop of weaker farm machinery volume, I think it would be helpful to me and I think a lot on the call here that if you could deconstruct how you get there within your guidance, either some color on geography or perhaps how some of the new products might contribute?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I think it's all of the above. So again nothing has changed from our view after the third quarter. We did deliver a number above 10% growth in the fourth quarter and our current expectation is that we should be able to do that in 2014. So I think a lot that we expressed last quarter is still valid and the relative elements of that. Yes, the macro economics here do matter to us, they do affect the markets throughout in California and much wider [indiscernible], all this also matters to us, but there are a number of bankers. So I think in terms of new product introductions we're sitting with a richer portfolio set, product portfolio set than we did a year ago. That tends to drive revenue. We have entered some new product categories. Maybe the most notable was irrigation. We believe particularly in a lot of portion of the year that gives us I hope quite a bit of revenue upside as we take the product and introduce it into our channel. I think geography does matter. We're aiming a number of markets that are not particularly penetrated and seeing rapid growth and I called out Europe in the script, particularly Eastern Europe, and I would take places like China are rapidly growing, at this moment in time anyway, not a whole lot of competitive pressures. And so I think it would be easier without a doubt to sell into a market with more equipment sales, it's just easier to sell into new equipment sales, but at the same time I think what we're seeing is that the emphasis on the U.S. is that the market for used equipment is actually quite strong and we are finding that we can retrofit onto the used equipment market reasonably well. So we are exposed to but not necessarily captive to the equipment market. So I think it's no one factor, it's a combination of factors and that's kind of a [indiscernible] get some stability on to the point where we think that we have a reasonable year ahead of us in Agriculture.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman.
Rick Eastman - Baird: Steve, a couple of things. Could you just speak to the mobile segment of the business just from two perspectives, one is the 20% growth, I mean by our estimation that was very little acquired growth in that number, so that's pretty close to core, it's clearly your best core growth rate of the year, and is there anything seasonal in there about in terms of deliveries of product or is that just good momentum heading into 2014?
Steven W. Berglund: So first of all I think there's probably more inorganic in the 20% maybe than you are calculating, so [indiscernible] inorganic element in that. Now part of this is just kind of some revenue recognition effects coming out of the acquisitions but I think it would be misleading you if I told you that the largest part of that 20% was organic. There are some seasonal elements in the business tied to the budgetary year, so I would say in general the fourth quarter will tend to be higher but not to any great extent. It's seasonal but not near to the extent that we've seen in construction and agriculture. So I think that we will see reasonable growth in this segment in the next year. In the script I talked to being consistent with the rest of the Company. So I think we are expecting double-digit growth in the segment in the year and that would be organic. And I think that we are looking later in the year I think there is a fair opportunity for us to make some innovation in this marketplace. We have acquired PeopleNet, we have acquired TMW, we have acquired LK in the transportation and logistics realm, and there is significant opportunity for us to bring those product solutions together to more tightly couple them and to create what would be a unique market offering to this market. And so I think we are seeing, we are anticipating both those effects later in the year and into 2015.
Rick Eastman - Baird: And is that, just given the op margin, just as a follow-up, the op margin there again ended the year at 14.6%, you did discuss a little bit about taking some of the incremental profitability, putting it back in the business but is it still reasonable to assume that in 2014 we can drive 200 basis points of improvement?
Steven W. Berglund: I wouldn't necessarily want to be that specific but I think that ultimately we think that from a structural standpoint we believe we are on our way to have 20% or so operating margin here. I think while you saw the quarterly number being up around 18% in the fourth quarter and so I think that that serves the benchmark. We don't anticipate moving backwards from that. There may be a quarter [indiscernible] then again it's in product mix with heavier hardware than it is software at any given quarter, but basically we think we've got a baseline here and that we'll continue to improve off of this baseline. I don't know that I necessarily want to commit to a number, [indiscernible].
Rick Eastman - Baird: Okay. All right, very good and very nice quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company: Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just wanted to get a little bit more granularity from you behind some of the strength that you're seeing in E&C and whether we can sort of think about sustainability of growth in 2014 relative to the segment, I know you guys had talked about a rebound in sort of residential and non-res construction but can you maybe help us quantify or understand a little bit the sub-segment drivers there?
Steven W. Berglund: So I think part of this is just is the comparative exercise. So in the first half of 2013, we suffered in survey instruments where we actually saw year-over-year declines, and so some of this is definitely a result – [indiscernible] to the modest level that is not yet [indiscernible] what I would call the long-term secular growth rate but survey instruments is particularly in the first half of the year is going to just show better but it's against a weak baseline from the year before. Heavy civil is I think will be up year-to-year if nothing else, driven by product innovation but it's still what I would call a market that's still not conforming to the long-term trend. For example in U.S. the Highway Bill is still on the sidelines, in Europe [indiscernible], so I think heavy civil, we're not anticipating a blowout year, we're just a expecting a better year 2014 compared to 2013. I think the one point of relative robustness, although I'm not sure I want to use that word, but yes, is particularly in U.S. residential and commercial is up and it is certainly not back to the levels we saw back in 2006 and 2007 but it is up against recent years and that's creating enough [indiscernible] enthusiasm or interest in the future if the contractors are both open to investing in technology, increasingly have no alternative to invest in technology to stay competitive. The threshold value to the competitive and contracting business in both heavy civil and in a vertical construction and [indiscernible] construction is margins are tough and the only way to really compete is with technology. So what we're seeing here is coming into a [indiscernible] where there are projects, is effectively the penetration on new projects is probably getting much, much higher than it would have been just a few years ago. So it's both the uptick in marketplace but also increased penetration as money is being spent on new projects. So I think that our expectations are not all that aggressive for 2014 but I think that it's going to be a decent year for us. And a few things happen, if for example the U.S. Highway Bill would pass, I think that would be a lift and I think economy like the Australia started to show some signs of revival and pipeline of projects in Australia is actually quite strong, if some of those started to come out and get funded, there are actually some upsides to heavy civil in which we tend to look with E&C. But what we are not counting on is any sort of recovery at the macro level. I think our expectation is that there will be no recovery at the macro level, if it does happen, that will be good news for us.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company: Great, and just as a follow-up, the services line continues to tick up here, can you give us maybe the top two or three products that are sort of driving an increase in sort of the recurring revenue side and where are you seeing more traction there?
Steven W. Berglund: Actually I might actually struggle to pick out one or two because I think what you're seeing is a relatively broader based phenomenon that's starting to occur across the Company. So in the major segments, E&C, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions, there is a general trend towards more services content and so I think this is a general trend. So I don't know that if I could necessarily point to any given product that is driving it. Certainly these acquisitions that we have done in the last few years are pushing it up but I think it's more of a broader-based phenomenon within the Company across for us multiple segments.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Andrea James.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company: Can you give us a sense of the U.S. regulatory landscape and the puts and takes I guess short and long-term and then particularly I'm thinking about the Farm Bill, the Affordable Care Act and any changes to the Minimum Wage and whether you see some changes in the channel from that?
Steven W. Berglund: I'll be comparatively benign here. So I think that, yes, I would say there are puts and takes. In terms of Affordable Care, I guess my comment is, I don't know, I'm not sure there are a lot of our partners, a lot of our customers have figured it out, so I think it's just a question mark that will get resolved at some point in the future. So I don't know that we are good enough to kind of figure out what the discrete effects of that are. But taking kind of the regulatory theme here and maybe expanding it a bit, so for example in transportation logistics, that is the Trimble business that probably is most directly getting affected, in this case [indiscernible] by increased regulation. So long haul truckers are increasingly regulated in terms of number of hours drivers can drive and a number of things, and so there is a very [great] (ph) swing towards both consolidation in the industry because small operators can simply not afford the regulatory load, but what it does require is more automation, is kind of drivers' logs of the old sort are no longer appropriate. And so as we [evolve] (ph), there's more automation that certainly is beneficial to Trimble because it kind of forces an investment in technology. And I think maybe then in general is the thing across a number of these businesses. What were the other…?
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company: The Farm Bill?
Steven W. Berglund: The Farm Bill, I think the Farm Bill is it puts more money into farmer's pockets, therefore it's beneficial to Trimble as a backdrop. I don't know that it per se drives any specific behavior because we are selling some bases lower cost increased – or lower fertilizer cost, lower field cost and improved productivity, and I think the calculation is towards import reduction, not necessarily kind of discretionary income per se, but it's helpful in the backdrop simply because it puts more money into farmer's pockets.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company: Okay, and then it seems like there's this growing global trend towards government and city funded virtual reference stations. I don't know how significant that is and I was just wondering if it changes the dynamic of your business at all and the need for access to the Trimble base stations, and also maybe I don't know if it drives software sales sort of the opposite side of that?
Steven W. Berglund: Actually I don't know that it evolves. First of all it's not a new phenomenon. The phenomenon has been around for 10 or more years and it's been a productive business for us. So the leaders in terms of, let's call it kind of city or regional infrastructure, the leaders probably without a doubt – maybe the early leader was Japan then followed by China and obviously Germany as well. So we've been selling reference stations incrementally, we've been selling infrastructure into that market for 10 years, it has been a good market for us, we have relative competitive advantage in that marketplace. So if the trend continues, that is fine with us. Now one of our faster growing, more successful businesses has been providing the services ourselves. We have a business we call positioning services, and that is right now pretty much agriculturally centric if you will. The majority of the revenues to that come from farmers whereas city or regional systems tend to be pointed more towards surveyors and civil engineering projects and that sort of thing. So the two are not necessarily contradictory but from a company standpoint, we'd go either way as we sell equipment into a city-based solution or we will continue to expand our own positioning services and at the moment both are strong businesses, our own positioning services are actually going significantly faster than providing hardware equipment. So I think either way if you look at the historical constraints to centimeter level positioning from global navigation systems, there have really been two constraints because a fair question to ask us when you talk about some of these markets still being underpenetrated, a fair question to ask is, okay, why [haven't we] (ph) done better in penetrating them, and there's always been two constraints out there. One is one of convenience, being able to get centimeters by flipping switch as opposed to setting up a mobile infrastructure. So whether we're providing it, whether a city or region is providing it, it is an enabler to our overall market because of making centimeter level accuracy convenient just flipping a switch, sometimes free, sometimes not free. And the other constraint has been in effect, no offense to any particular group out there, but [indiscernible] down the instruments, so that it's a few buttons as opposed to a complicated procedure to get to centimetres, but you see this move towards providing more infrastructure. Again whether we are providing it or somebody else is providing it, it's enabling to the overall market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Very nice quarter. First can we talk a little about the E&C business some more, I mean the volume was good, you had some momentum going into this year, you said you have easy comparisons, can you talk a little bit about the profitability side of that business, we always thought you can get back to 20% gross operating margins, you are there now, you really have quite strong the rest of the quarters of the year, are we now at a point where you've gotten back to where you want to get and there's more investment in the business or are you going to look at margins continue to expand up moderately from current levels?
Steven W. Berglund: We talk being overly kind of predicted this but one I would say is the same trend listening elsewhere around the Company is definitely operative and E&C is, you look at the probable future list of business, it's going to trend towards more service content, it's going to trend towards more software content and we'll tend to bring along with, that business will tend to bring along a higher gross margin and of course discipline in terms of the cost structure below the gross margin. I would say that over time we should continue to elevate the operating margins within E&C. So I would say overall we are not done yet and that there will be [indiscernible] a secular trend towards higher operating margins in the segment.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: The other question I have is a little bit difficult to ask because we know in Ag there was a very strong buy at the end of the year of equipment before the expiration of the Bonus Depreciation and especially section 179 which drove used equipment, you touched on that but it would seem to me that the farmer would be more interested in buying the actual equipment and getting it at the end of the year and you retrofit the stuff that you would predominantly we something for productivity that it would be doing in the first half of the year as opposed to seeing demand at the end of the year, is that a fair statement, we know there's a lot of [tax] (ph) buying and can you comment what are you seeing [tax] (ph) buying in other sectors?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I think that given the first of all seasonality in agriculture, I think it's hard to distinguish what's the tax driven effect from what is the normal seasonal effect as farmers tend to go back to either late in the year or more likely early in the year, [indiscernible] of the planting cycle, and again our stuff is not necessarily big dollar, so the calculation may not be [indiscernible] on the tax calculation. So I would say I think your hypothesis is fine. I think that again what's driving us – what drove us in the fourth quarter and what's driving us here in the first quarter I would say is stronger forces associated within just tax line but I think your hypothesis works fine for me.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Just one final question, Advanced Devices keeps standing up here in terms of your profitability. Is that really now in a steady state route or is it just been in place because there's some business in '14?
Steven W. Berglund: Again I think what you see is what we're able to get there. There are a couple of elements in there. There is what I call a couple of stable businesses that don't have a whole lot of growth potential kind of embedded board business which has been a Trimble business forever but it's an OEM business typically categorized by unit volumes going up and prices coming down, so you end up with the same kind of product [indiscernible] numbers every year, and so it will bounce around some but does not necessarily have a whole lot of growth potential. Same is true with a little bit of a difference for the timing modules that we sell into infrastructure, typically telecommunications infrastructure, that will tend to vary within a relatively wide range depending on who is building what project at any point in time. But overall obviously those two businesses don't have a whole lot of headroom to grow. Now within that segment there are a couple of interesting other elements. One is the RFID business we bought a few years ago, ThingMagic. They had a very, very strong double digit year in 2013. So it's a small base. So the number doesn't really move the company results but it's a very strong growth market and has the potential to – as we integrate that capability more and more into other Trimble solutions, presumably has even higher growth prospects. And the other growth element in the segment is Applanix which is a Canadian-based company which focuses on inertial systems often times integrated with GPS but with the advances in inertial over the last few years and the fact that kind of [indiscernible] technology has finally made it to the point of maturity, we again saw double-digit, not great double-digit but double-digit growth in Applanix for the year. So all of those things factored together in the segment but overall it's a pretty steady effect segment. I don't think there's a whole lot of downside to it but at the same time it's maybe a little – has fewer growth dynamics than the rest of the Company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors.
Ryan Connors - Janney, Montgomery, Scott: A couple of additional questions on Agriculture, specifically I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the composition of your customer base in the Agriculture business and specifically do you have any numbers or color on what percent of your revenue is coming from actual growers, actual farmers versus the purchase being made by a trusted advisor to a farmer whether it's an ergonomic advisor or a machinery dealer or someone like that and the thesis being that those sales won't necessarily as closely tie to this farm income and cash flow, so any color you can give us there?
Steven W. Berglund: So I would like to say that the trusted advisor is a key element of the buying cycle at this point in time, that would probably be an [indiscernible] at this point in time. So I think that right now our sales through channel are typically to the farmer. Now I think you pick up on a trend for the future, I think that Ag is going to go through a reasonably significant transformation in the next five years or so as more and more sensor capabilities are added and more and more information capabilities are added to the marketplace. So I think that as you say the trust advisor becomes a bigger element in terms of the technology acquisition cycle but I would say at the moment it is still pretty conventional as we are selling through channel and the channel brings it to the farmer and the trusted advisor is not a significant impact in the buying decision.
Ryan Connors - Janney, Montgomery, Scott: Got it. And then the other question I had was on the issue pricing in the agriculture business and particularly on some of the new product innovation like the new TMX display, are you having success in getting paid for the additional value that those new products should bring into the table, in other words are they pricing at a premium at ASP and are they having success achieving that?
Steven W. Berglund: I think as a general statement the answer is, yes, we are getting premium pricing, but I would say that looking at it in terms of a strategic realm, market arbitrage pretty well and I think that if you look at Trimble over the last 10 years or maybe even longer, both construction and agriculture is I think the tendency [indiscernible] has done, okay, prices have been steady, remarkably steady in some cases but the amount functionality you're getting for the price is increasing. So Trimble has historically been able to put out a premium against the market rate and has usually been able to add a premium for functionality throughout the marketplace, but I think over the long cycle, or maybe the way to put it is I say the, not that I know the first right answer, but if you took flagship product in agriculture or survey or heavy civil, if you took the flagship product from 10 years ago and compared it to the flagship product pricing today, they probably will be [indiscernible], it's just that you're getting a whole lot more functionality today. So I would argue that over the long term it's more about price and maintaining the price as opposed to necessarily being able to ratchet up pricing over time but I think in the short-term, yes, we are seeing kind of the ability to [indiscernible] into the functionality.
Ryan Connors - Janney, Montgomery, Scott: And then one last one if I could, Steve, just [indiscernible] have been a big [indiscernible] just nationally and agriculture consists [indiscernible] as one of the presumed prominent applications and Trimble did formally introduce the drone product couple of weeks ago. So can you just give us your thoughts on how big that can become, obviously not this year but over the next few years, can that become a needle moving product for you?
Steven W. Berglund: It has that potential, we have to climb over some regulatory burdens in the meantime, so the FAA in the U.S. is still not being overly precise in terms of what's allowed and so in general it is difficult to fly a drone for commercial purposes in the U.S. unless you are a university or using it for personal use. So I think there are constraints if you are coming to a large market in the U.S. at this point in time, but I think that in general internationally I think with some maturity, right now there's a lot of ours but I think there are sensors, the sensors have to evolve, the AMOLED's capability has to evolve, [indiscernible] in mature applications but I think there is a long list of potential (audio gap) base in Belgium, it was primarily to use in survey type applications and geospatial applications but agriculture is likely to be the single largest application and that becomes available for the commercial drone. So we've got a position on the Ag side, we've got a position on the airplane side, so we would hope to be in something [indiscernible] position when the markets starts to develop.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing.
Ian Ing - Lazard: I share my congratulations there. My first question is in GIS segment, been around for a while, so as we look forward, how much of the drivers are based on cyclical trends, the government spending or perhaps some secular shifts given the hardware competitive landscape and the shift to software?
Steven W. Berglund: So I think right now what we're seeing is cyclical more so than secular. I think over the next three, four years I think that – and this has been part of our strategy all along, is that GIS will become a less rich market in terms of being able to put out specialty handheld hardware whether it's a smartphone or some other device that will take more and more of the hardware sales and is a logical move on the market. I think what we're seeing at this point in time is just the fact that U.S. and Europe and even China, there has been a substantial reduction in the amount of flow from government. So for example typically in GIS our seasonal high quarter is the third quarter driven out U.S. When the federal government budget year is about to end, people tend to spend their budget on very enthusiastically in the month of September and historically it has been highly predictable that we get a major bump in September. It simply did not occur in 2013. And so right now I think we're probably cyclical not secular, but I think over the next three, four years, the business will shift.
Ian Ing - Lazard: And could you give us an update on some of the potential for large size deals as you look into the rest of this year and could sort of add to some lumpiness and how would you rate those expectations?
Steven W. Berglund: So Trimble is going through a general transition process a few years ago, you could characterize Trimble by a company that adds up thousands of transactions at the end of the quarter and that determines kind of the revenue flow of the quarter. With the addition of the position now in transportation and logistics, kind of Mobile Solutions in general as well as a move on the E&C side towards more key accounts, it is getting to be more – but still a baseline of [indiscernible] smaller deals, they are getting more large deals and that could in any given quarter kind of influence the results. So let's say there are large number of larger deals that would be in potential of $5 million or $10 million. The pipeline of those are quite long. How many will fall this year, how many will fall next year is hard to say but there will be some lumpiness that I would say is we're becoming large enough as hopefully kind of the portfolio effect with most of that.
Ian Ing - Lazard: If I could fit one more in tax rate, I guess we can make assumptions on reinstatement of R&D tax credit, how that plays out but then its contribution of U.S. revenues, this higher contribution, is this more of a transient issue based on product cycles or is it more of a sustained trend going forward?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think the relative U.S. performance is right now more based on the fact that U.S., albeit not at historical levels but is the one economy that's kind of growing reliably at this point. So I think in terms of where our earnings are, I think it kind of depends on Europe coming back or we're seeing more growth outside of the U.S. and so I think it will shift over time depending on kind of overall market condition. So I would not expect it to be necessarily – I [indiscernible] peg a number but I would say it's the general trend in the future of some recovery outside of U.S. is the roughly larger portion of earnings coming from outside.
Operator: At this time, there are no more questions. Thank you for joining the call.
Steven W. Berglund: Thank you. Talk to you next quarter.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Matthew, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our host, Ms. Willa McManmon. Ms. McManmon, you may begin.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Julie Shepard, our Interim CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release. The press release and additional financial statements are posted on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. Before I turn the call over to Steve, I want to remind you that Trimble Management will be presenting at the Baird Conference in Chicago next week and the Wells Fargo Conference in New York the week of November 11. Let me now turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. The issues that impacted us in the first 6 months of the year remained with us in the third quarter, albeit more emerging signs of encouragement for 2014. The constraints continue to revolve around very inconsistent market conditions in multiple regions, deferrals of investment due to continuing economic uncertainty and heightened confusion around government funding sources, particularly in the U.S. The points of improving momentum in the quarter were the continued strengthening of residential and commercial construction in the U.S. The return of growth to survey instruments and better insight into the agricultural market, which enables an expectation of double-digit growth in that business in 2014. Although the 2014 environment remains ambiguous and challenging to predict, these and other effects lead us to expect a step up in Trimble's organic growth in 2014 from the level we saw in 2013 without any material help from the economy. With the probable contribution of acquisitions to revenue, the combined effect should enable us to report a higher growth rate than the 10.5% to 11% of 2013. Revenue growth of 10% to $556.5 million was consistent with our expectations, although it was at the lower end of that range. Although the growth rate remains below our historical secular trend, the year-to-year comparison for the quarter was particularly challenging given 2 large discrete orders in GIS and mining in the third quarter last year that had no comparable analog this year. The quality of our financial model also continued its progression in the quarter with non-GAAP gross margin of 56.9%, which is up 1.5 points from the third quarter in 2012. This trend in gross margin reflects a continuing structural shift from the increasing value content being provided by bundles of hardware, software and services. This led to a quarterly non-GAAP operating margin of 21.2%. The non-GAAP operating expense level was at 35.6% of revenue, with the increase entirely due to the impact of recent acquisitions. As we have discussed in prior calls, longer term, we are working to bank the higher gross margins and to work expenses as a percentage of revenue down to historical levels, providing operating margin lift. While we expect the fourth quarter to mimic the third quarter, our revenue guidance range for the quarter, which Julie will discuss, is broader than our historical standard. The wider range results from the generally greater uncertainty in our revenue forecast as we introduce larger contracts into the mix. Many of these contracts in isolation have the potential of pushing us outside our traditional narrow range if we miss performance commitments by a few days as revenue recognition accounting rules cause a reinterpretation of the precise schedule of when the revenue associated with a contract is recognized. In the fourth quarter, we have 3 examples of this uncertainty. All have the possibility of falling in either the fourth or the first quarter. Together, their effect is meaningful. One relates to whether, in the judgment of the customer, we have met the acceptance criteria for a large contract by the end of the quarter. The second is centered on when we will be able to recognize the first revenue on the multiyear $63 million to $99 million contract with the Marines and Army, which was announced in August. In this case, the U.S. government shutdown has delayed the timetable on implementation, and it is unclear whether we will be able to recover the schedule before the fourth quarter ends. The third issue is dependent on specific customer meeting certain criteria, which would allow us to move a discrete item out of the deferred revenue balance into revenue during the quarter. More generally, we continue to be negatively impacted by the U.S. budgetary crisis. In reality, the environment has worsened since the beginning of the year. During the first half of the year, we expected the sequester effects would be institutionalized in the new budget year, which began October 1. This would have produced relative certainty even if they had to lower expenditure level. Instead, the shutdown and inability to achieve resolution has increased both skepticism and uncertainty in our relevant markets. Although our direct exposure to U.S. government spending remains comparatively small, the indirect effects are significant and becoming more apparent to us. The 3 Trimble product categories that are most affected are survey instruments and heavy civil in the E&C segment and GIS in the Field Solutions segment. Heavy civil is currently being affected by the paralysis in addressing the inadequate federal funding of highway infrastructure construction. Survey instrument and GIS sales heavily depend directly or indirectly on funding from all levels of government. In many cases, even if the apparent funding for our users is coming from the municipal, county or state agencies, a large portion of that funding is ultimately derived from federal sources. The uncertainty relating to the availability and level of future funding has had a widespread chilling effect on the willingness of our users to seriously commit to new projects. GIS is the product category most affected financially, and it is down sharply year-to-year. The relative good news is that despite the imposed constraints, both heavy civil and survey instruments are growing in the U.S, with survey instruments growing double digits in the third quarter. The picture across the regions remains inconsistent and volatile. European sales for the quarter were up approximately 13% year-to-year, with the strongest push coming from agriculture. North America was up over 18% year-to-year, reflecting improvements in the residential and commercial construction market, acquisitions and revived growth in survey instruments. The rest of the world was down, reflecting a general sideways trend in some markets, such as Brazil and China, and recession in other markets, most notably Australia. In recent years, these markets have been relative mainstays for us. And the recent effects on portfolio performance has impacted us negatively in the short term. Directionally, we are looking for improved organic performance in 2014. While the number of moving parts make it difficult to precisely quantify an outlook, we believe we are currently in a transition zone, which leads to an improved baseline for 2014. The outlook is based on a number of discrete perspectives. In E&C, survey instruments have returned to growth, and we expect this to continue into 2014. Part of the lift is coming from an improving survey product portfolio. For the product categories we refer to as building construction, our growth expectation is supported by the trend in U.S. residential and commercial construction, new product introductions and the growing attractiveness of our increasingly integrated product capability to major construction accounts. While our current judgment of growth possibilities in heavy civil remain conservative given worldwide infrastructures spending levels, we currently expect growth levels no worse than 2013 with logical arguments that they might further improve based on new product categories and a developing distribution channel. In Field Solutions, we expect the agricultural revenue to grow at a double-digit rate, partly driven by the expansion of the number of new product categories and a higher rate of new product introductions. Our admittedly conservative view on GIS is that our dismal performance will bottom out in the fourth quarter. And starting in the first quarter, it will cease to be a notable pain point as we lap the 2013 performance. Mobile Solutions reported results will look different -- significantly different in 2014 as the acquisition effects of 2013 disappear, and we will trend towards something closer to the organic baseline. We believe that the financial model will continue to improve, resulting in higher operating margins. Overall, the view is that these effects will enable the step up in organic growth with an enhancement from acquisition effects. Finally, our CFO search has been methodical and extensive with a rich field of candidates. We are in the final stages of the search, and there should be news in the near future. Let me turn the call over to Julie Shepard, our Interim CFO. During this interim period, Julie's competency and commitment has provided us with the ability to conduct a careful and methodical search without a sense of urgency to fill a void. Julie?
Julie A. Shepard: Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll be covering non-GAAP numbers today. The GAAP numbers as well as the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers are detailed in our earnings press release, along with the financial data by segment. In today's call, I will be covering other relevant quarterly data in discussing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall revenue was $556.5 million, up 10%. By geography in the third quarter, 56% of revenue came from North America, 22% from Europe, 14% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from the rest of the world. Company non-GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, up 1.5 points over the prior year, due primarily to greater contributions from higher margin software, maintenance and subscription revenue. In the third quarter, non-GAAP operating expense was $198.3 million or 35.6% of revenue. This was up as compared to $174.4 million or 34.6% of revenue in the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to acquisitions. Third quarter non-GAAP operating income was $118.2 million or 21.2% of revenue as compared to $105.3 million or 20.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP nonoperating income was $497,000, down as compared to $3 million in the third quarter of 2012, primarily because of lower profitability from equity investments. In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the company's effective tax rate was 14% as compared to 19% in the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to the geographical mix of pretax income, the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, as well as the discrete items. Non-GAAP net income of $101.9 million was up 17% as compared to the third quarter of 2012. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.39 compared with diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 in the third quarter of 2012. We finished the quarter with $115.3 million in cash and $809.1 million in debt on a multiple of 1.7x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We paid down $90.1 million of debt in the quarter. Net debt was $687.1 million this quarter as compared to a high of $776.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2013. Cash flow from operations was $106.4 million for the quarter. Accounts receivable was $361.6 million and days sales outstanding was 59 days as compared to 56 days in the second quarter of 2013, due to the nonlinearity of sales and up slightly as compared to 58 days in the year-ago quarter. Inventory in the third quarter of 2013 was $241.5 million as compared to $258.7 million in the second quarter of 2013. Turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect revenue between $560 million and $580 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.17 to $0.21 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.39. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $42 million related to previous acquisitions, anticipated acquisition cost of $3.5 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $10.5 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 16% to 18% tax rate and 261.5 million shares outstanding. It should be noted that the fourth quarter 2013 guidance includes expenses related to several trade shows and a technology conference, which were not included in third quarter expenses. Have a safe Halloween everyone. And with that, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Cox.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: My first question is, as it relates to your guidance for the fourth quarter, you noted the 3 discrete items that could shift from Q4 into Q1. I just wanted to have a better understanding of how, if all 3 were to hit, would that be the upper bound of for your revenue guidance? And if all 3 were to shift to Q1, so that would be the lower bound? Is that the way to think about it?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, the arithmetic doesn't quite work out that way, but I think that's probably the right way to think about it, plus or minus a few million. But I think that's probably the appropriate way to think about it.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And then on the -- the service and subscription revenue contribution jumped up a couple of hundred basis points versus where you'd been trending the last 3 quarters. I'd be interested if you could comment on which segment drove that sequential increase? And is this 28% of sales level that we should expect going forward or if not higher?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I'll probably be a bit more general than that, because I don't want to get into the mode of kind of tracking. It's a fairly volatile number at the segment level, but I think directionally, longer term that's the general trend of the company. And I would say that, okay, again, not necessarily speaking directly to the third quarter, I would say, obviously, Mobile Solutions is heavily already in that mix. But then, E&C has already moved into that direction. If you look at both the acquisitions and then our general strategy in E&C, it will also trend there. But I think that agriculture in particular, which is really not that heavy in that realm at this point in time, will over the next couple of years start to shift in that direction more aggressively, as well as we work out the elements of the Connected Farm, which is very much software focused, but increasingly will be service-focused as well. So I would -- so by inference, the answer is kind of E&C and Mobile Solutions.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And one last question on the ag side there. The commentary around double-digit growth in ag is, it's certainly more bullish than what the large iron machinery guys are talking about or at least sort of intimating in terms of what their orders look like. And I'd be curious what sort of visibility you have or what gives you the confidence that you'll return to double-digit growth in ag?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think there are a few factors with some variability around the kind of point estimates for 2013. But I think directionally, yes, we are more bullish. So one is just new product introductions. So the last year, there have been, let's call it, not that many new product introductions from us into the marketplace. That rate is expected to increase. And that tends to tick -- carry a lifting factor on its own. And then in kind of the same vein, but definitionally different is new product categories. So for example, a few months ago now or 2 or 3 months ago, we announced a couple of very small acquisitions to put us into the irrigation space. The idea there is that we can plug what must be a -- that solution into our larger distribution channel, and that we should get a fair amount of lift from an entirely new product category. There are other examples, but I would say that's the most interesting one, which is adding just a product category that has not historically been in Trimble and engaging our distribution channel. And there should be a lift factor there. And part of it, I guess the third factor is that in kind of more of a competitive realm is we think that we have -- in terms of our approach, we think that our approach to solving the problem in the field is differentially better than competition. So we would expect that there will be some replacement in the field of some elements that have been factory-fitted by others in the last year or so. We think that there's a competitive advantage. So all of those added together gives us a reasonably strong view that it will be double digits, being a little vague in terms of just what those digits might be. But I think we're pretty secure in the belief that over the course of the year that it will be 2 digits.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: One technical question, one. In the -- the 14% tax rate was obviously lower than the guidance we expected. And you said there was some discrete items. Is there something that we should know about? That was a couple of million dollars of discrete items. So what caused the 14% tax rate?
Julie A. Shepard: Yes. So the 14% tax rate was a geographical mix, but that was part of it. The other part is, there was not an R&D tax credit last year. It was reinstated this year. And then we just had one item where we had a statute expire, and we're able to release what's called a income tax reserve.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: How big was that? Is it negligible? Or is it meaningful? That's really the question.
Steven W. Berglund: It was meaningful.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Was it a couple of million dollars? Is that -- you beat...
Steven W. Berglund: Eli, let's just leave it as meaningful.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: So I mean, can we attribute the quarterly beat versus all the estimates to the tax base is really what I'm asking.
Steven W. Berglund: No. It was more complicated than that. Yes. So it was meaningful but not dominating.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Advanced Devices, I'm going up in questions, again, keeps surprising at much stronger numbers. Is this earnings rate sustainable? Does it fall back to more normal rates? Are we seeing a fairly high level of profitability in income per quarter?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think if we are to look at it over a multiyear kind of baseline, this would be higher performance than I would generally expect, particularly on the earnings side. Now having said that, if you look at the elements of Advanced Devices, some don't have necessarily a whole lot of dynamics associated with them, such as our timing business or our embedded board business. But then you look to -- also in this segment is our RFID segment. It's the ThingMagic acquisition we did a few years ago. They are getting some traction, both in the kind of, let's call it merchant market out there selling RFID solutions to companies that have generally kind of tracking challenges. But then I think what we're seeing is traction within Trimble. So for example, tracking assets on a construction site, probably being the easiest one to explain. So I would say that, if there is going to be a lift in that segment over the next year or 2, it will be probably more likely driven from this RFID capability that appears to be getting true traction at this point in time. So I would say, probably not a whole lot of, let's call it, upside potential out of the segment, but then caveating that with the RFID capability, which is -- that's got a fair amount of potential, but probably over a 2-year period, not next quarter.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: But the current level is sustainable? I mean, that's really what I'm more driving at.
Steven W. Berglund: Again, I think the point would be I wouldn't count on this level of relative performance out of the segment. I think we're probably above the deliverable baseline. So I would have -- it'll be volatile by the nature of it, but I wouldn't necessarily put this exact performance into next quarter.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And now as we talk about the Field Solutions. The ag business, you talked double digit. And I think you were talking about the stability hopefully by the end of the year in GIS. So I guess you're assuming the double digit in ag next year and we'd have GIS relatively flattish next year is your best kind of assumption that we're looking at?
Steven W. Berglund: That is the assumption we're looking at. GIS, which is very, very exposed to government funding has just had a terrible year. Historically, we've never had a need to talk to GIS. It's been a business that probably we characterized as kind of single-digit growth levels, but very high operating margins. And this year, we've had the unfortunate experience of having to talk about GIS as part of the explanation of the company. Again, we lap ourselves in the -- starting in the first quarter. Management believes they're going to grow the business next year. They're quite committed to the idea of growing the business. I'm simply saying our kind of current expectations are flat, at least removes them as a pain point for the company. So yes, but your formulation is the right one at the moment.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And you said the current level of profitability we're seeing, there's some seasonality to it, would not -- would be more representative than the prior levels of profitability, the higher levels, until GIS gets some legs under it?
Steven W. Berglund: The operating margins of ag and GIS are relatively similar to each other. So yes, so GIS has brought it down some this year, but it's -- I would say the operating margins last quarter and this quarter are probably kind of relatively indicative of what we see next year. Ag has been a pretty strong comp and GIS has drifted down some.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, well talk a bit about the ag business. You have your approach to the market. Deere is now playing games. And now Monsanto has gone out and bought a company, and they want to play in the same kind of market. Can you give us some color as to how you see the market shaping up? Because you seem to be by far the strongest company as we go into data movement in the ag business, but I just wanted to get how you're viewing what Deere and Monsanto seem to be want to play at?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so again, until recently with Monsanto becoming -- assuming a different profile in the industry, the competitive set has really been constant for 10 years. There've been few, if any, real entrants into the business. There have been actually a couple of departures. But I would say Deere, from a competitive mix, is nothing new. Monsanto is, if you will, the new entrant. But I don't think they have yet become, let's call it, a force in the marketplace. And then I think there are larger themes that play out over the next few years in agriculture that kind of extend beyond kind of the current product mix and the like. So I think it's quite an interesting story playing out over the next 3 or 4 years, which involves much more service, much more information content, much more of an advisory role to the farmer. I'll just indicate that it's -- that market is forming up. You can see us responding to that changing market with some of the acquisitions we've done and in some of the acquisitions that are likely to happen. But in the next year, I would not expect, let's call it, step function changes competitively. I think it plays out over multiple years.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Steve, could you just maybe address the margin? The improvement in E&C sequentially on roughly the same revenue number? Is that a mix issue?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, it would be -- again, we tend to be pretty hardwired into looking year-to-year more so than sequentially, simply because there are some seasonal effects and event trade shows and such moving around. But I would say it would be, overall, the fact that survey came back relatively -- or at least in a relative sense fairly strongly, and brought with it generally high gross margins that translated into operating. And then I think if you look at it, what's happening in building and construction, or building construction, yes, we took out -- and this is at least a marginal effect. So if you look at -- we took a -- back in 2008 and 2009, we took a horrendous beating in that category. The market more or less disappeared. And some of our product categories, we saw a 40% or 50% drop simply because the market did disappear. We took our cost base down at that point in time, but we have our cost in place. So any kind of marginal revenue increase we get in that product category is going to have a tendency to move operating margin pretty strongly. And I think that's what's playing out at this point in time. So we're probably getting significant operating leverage on the boost we're getting in the building -- out of the residential and commercial space. But I would say those are probably the 2 primary effects that would be playing out in E&C at this point.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I see. Okay. And then just a real quick question on mobile. If we take out an assumed acquisition contribution, was there much growth there? I mean, I basically end up at a point or 2 of core growth. Is that in the ballpark or is mobile a little bit stronger than that? And it strikes me that part of this revenue recognition issue that we could face in the fourth quarter dumps into Mobile Solutions. So was that a factor in this quarter in terms of core growth?
Steven W. Berglund: No. In terms of this quarter, actually, the 3 effects -- discrete effects in the fourth quarter are not mobile. I think you're low in terms of attributing a point or 2. It may turn out to be double -- or single-digit growth, but it's larger than that. And certainly, that's what we would expect in 2014. I think to boost the growth rate, the most easily identified factor in mobile against -- there's the general market is the fact that there's significant market still to be penetrated in the Mobile Solutions segment. There's always that in the backdrop. But I think the single most discrete opportunity available to us in the next 12 to 24 months comes out of the combination of TMW and PeopleNet and ALK in the transportational logistics realm, where TMW is something of the enterprise solution, PeopleNet is something of the mobile solution in that case. They share some customers. They do not share a lot of customers. And I think the view is that, as we integrate those 2 product lines more closely together, is there's the potential to, let's call it, cross-sell. TMW customers being exposed to PeopleNet and vice versa. I would say that's the single largest growth opportunity -- organic growth opportunity in the segment available to us in the next 12 to 24 months. There are others, but that may be the most significant opportunity. It'll take some time. But yes, but in answer to your question, I think you're low in terms of attributing just 1 point or 2 of growth -- organic growth in the mobile.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to understand a little bit more around the GIS business. Are you guys seeing anything that might be a little bit more of a structural impact as opposed to just sort of government budgets impacting the business? Especially around the device side of things, I just wanted to get a sense of if there's anything else that maybe has a second order effect besides government budgets?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, it's a very fair question, honestly. And the question's basically, do cell phones start to move our traditional ruggedized devices out of the marketplace? I would say at the moment, that's a really good question, but in the context of a few years. And I think that we are very aware of it. And that increasingly, our whole business there will be, let's call it, device -- become more and more device agnostic. We've been looking hard at kind of the results for this year in terms of whether that structural shift is kind of really impacting the market at this point in time. And yes, around the edges, there is a tendency to use either cell phones or, let's call it, kind of low end -- what we would attribute as low end devices. And that accounts for a little bit of this drop. But by and large, this drop this year is just kind of no money being spent, not so much a market share or kind of a solutions share. And -- but again, a very fair question, but I'd say more in the context of 2 to 3 years out. And I think that we're architecting the business to anticipate that.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. So you've already shared also some color around sort of your confidence that ag can maybe grow on a double digit business next year. Can you talk maybe about why you see the rest of the business, outside of Field Solutions, showing an improvement in terms of growth rate even without a pickup in macro? I just wanted to maybe hear sort of the top factors that you're seeing to sort of support that re-acceleration?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think building construction is pretty much -- well, in the first instance, the first order effect is the fact that commercial and residential construction is showing a pulse rate these days, whereas for a few years it didn't show any pulse rate. So I think that drives that. Now in survey, I think earlier this year, I think we were attributing kind of flattish to even down sales to survey instruments. I would say that was the pertubation, and we're kind of returning to some level of normalcy in spite of government spending levels. If that got fixed, I think we'd see a significant upside. I think the theory on survey instruments is that, if you will, is the market has really never kind of found its feet if you talk to surveyors out doing work for construction companies or for government agencies or cadastral surveyors doing one thing or the other. I think the market has been comparatively muted really since the 2008 collapse. And so if you look at it, surveyors out there, practicing surveyors, are probably 2 or 3 generations behind from a technology standpoint. They've been making do with old technology. And the model here would be -- the market model here would be; that if they start to see any pickup in activity, they're going to start to look at, okay, either hiring another person, talking about a small survey services firm or putting in -- updating their technology, getting the productivity improvements and potentially avoiding hiring the person. That is, I think, the magic moment. I don't necessarily know that we're truly at that point yet, but I think some of those dynamics are starting to work is that there -- the industry is, I think, significantly behind overall in terms of applying technology, and we may be seeing that. And I'd say the other thing in survey is the fact that, for example, at our INTERGEO show with Germany earlier in October, we made a number of meaningful product introductions. In fact, we created a whole new category of product there. And I think our products will lift that. So heavy civil, we're basically kind of pegging as kind of steady as she goes kind of similar to 2013. Survey, we're looking for a step up. The building construction stuff, we're expecting a step up both because of the market and the fact that we got an increasingly attractive portfolio and can start selling in a way that we haven't had historically. Then there's ag. There's GIS, which we're assuming to be flat. And then mobile, we're basically kind of -- so yes, the reported numbers will -- growth rate will drop, but apparently maybe less of a drop than people are anticipating. So those are, I think, are the large drivers. So it's -- we're not naming a number. It's directional, but I think it's -- I think the facts support the directional guidance.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrea James.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Can you guys give us an update on Trimble's optimal leverage as far as net debt? And when you think you'll stop adding to net debt? Or you'll be at that sort of maximum leverage?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think if you look at it as net debt in the quarter from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter dropped by roughly 10%. So I think we may have passed our peak. I think, certainly, the debt level that we're at is very comfortable. There's no issue on coverage. I think we feel comfortable as a company looking at the capital structure with the capital structure that has a debt-to-equity ratio somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4. I think that's comparable in some sense to the comfort zone for us taking advantage of low interest rates and making sure our weighted average cost of capital is kind of in the right territory. So I think if we revert and I -- right now I would say is the default expectation of us, if we revert to the pattern of acquisition that we displayed really until a couple of years ago when circumstances caused us to make the decision to be a spectator or a participant as assets became available. If we revert to kind of the traditional pattern kind of over time is, we can handle -- we would expect to be able to handle that kind of acquisition load out of operating cash flow and probably continue to drift down from a net debt perspective. But it's not a matter of mantra for us. We're very much comfortable with where we are at this point in time. And I think we have the flexibility to kind of make the appropriate long-term decisions for the company that kind of levels that -- around where they are at this point in time.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: And then a follow-up. How do you define organic growth versus growth from acquisitions? And the only reason I'm asking, I guess, is because it seems that, particularly software acquisitions get integrated, and then in turn might drive legacy product sales, so I was just wondering how you guys break it out?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, that's actually the core point of this, and why on a quarterly basis we tend to be a little careful in terms of, let's call it, hard definitions of organic versus hard definitions of acquisition. And once a year, I guess the pattern is now kind of the January call, is to kind of give a 1-year perspective because that's exactly the issue. So just giving a practical example here, we made this -- well, I've already given one, which is TMW and PeopleNet. So TMW would kind of calculate out as an acquisition this year. But if PeopleNet goes out and sells TMW a product, is that organic or more acquisition? Is kind of a fuzzy category. But another example would be a few months ago we acquired Trade Services, which is a content company down in San Diego, okay? And the theory there is we tie that to the SketchUp three-dimensional warehouse and kind of significantly increase the value content of that. So as opposed to simply selling a content that consist of a manufacturer's part number, a description, maybe some other information that we open up the opportunity for the manufacturer to create a three-dimensional model of the object, put it in SketchUp's three-dimensional warehouse and then somebody using our BIM product reaches out, grabs that three-dimensional model and drops it into a BIM model. So technically, is that an acquisition-related revenue boost from Trade Services or is that Trimble taking that capability and applying it and is arguably organic? So it is a fuzzy boundary and -- which is why we've been a little reluctant to kind of create, on a quarterly basis anyway, hard definitions here that really -- where the definition is really kind of a fuzzy boundary sort of definition.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: I appreciate that. And just for next year, what was the organic versus acquisition? Knowing that it's hard, but I was just curious of what you thought the balance would be?
Steven W. Berglund: And on that one, I'm going to remain fuzzy at least until January.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our final question comes from the line of Rich Valera.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Steve, I just want to follow-up on that organic versus inorganic for next year. Because as I understood it, I guess you went into this year thinking you had 5 points of inorganic growth kind of in hand with the TMW acquisition. So not having done a large acquisition this year, I would think that going into next year, you would have much less inorganic baked in. Is that a fair assumption?
Steven W. Berglund: Directionally, that's a fair assumption. But again, I'd kind of point back to this fuzzy boundary between organic and acquisition from a definitional standpoint. Case in point here, for example, would be this irrigation -- these small irrigation business we've bought. Okay. They've got a great product. They have not had distribution. So for example, we are counting on being able to plug that capability into our distribution. So whether that's acquisition or organic, from my point of view, it's organic, we may attribute it to being acquisition. But that will probably have a fair amount of upside potential. And yes, but directionally, you're right is that there are -- there will be less inorganic. As we see it at this point in time, in terms of what we have bankable for next year, there is less inorganic pop in 2014 than there was in 2013.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I would think by several percentage points now? I mean, not to cut it too fine, but TMW was pretty significant and you had that sort of in the last part of last year, so.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so again, I'd say you're directionally right. I'm mum. I'm just trying to avoid pre-exposing myself until I have another quarter of experience here, but we're trying to convey directional content or information more so than a precise formulation at this point.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: And I guess, relatedly, just with the ag double-digit comment, you've acknowledged that the macro doesn't look so great in terms of unit sales. I mean, do you have some rough idea of what you're expecting for unit sales, if nothing else from, say, CNH your OEM partner?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I mean, so I think we're conveying the sense that it will -- there will be kind of unit volume growth in that realm. And I talked to product. I've talked to product category. I've talked to kind of competitive factors. I think the other one, now that you mentioned CNH, it's not going to be a huge -- probably a huge difference in 2014. But there -- we also have a number -- a fair number of possibilities with OEMs other than CNH as well. So I think that may play out over 2 or 3 years to the point where it starts to influence Trimble numbers. But the contract we've signed with CNH now a couple of years ago gave us more relative freedom to kind of go out and deal with the mix fleet problem in agriculture. And we're trying to leverage on that at this point in time. So it's -- I would say the argument for agriculture in terms of double digits doesn't rely so much on, let's call it, driving forces, driving market forces in terms of kind of aggregate agricultural data, but more 4 or 5 factors coming together that gives us, let's call it, a fair amount of faith that we can kind of restore the double-digit element of -- in agriculture.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Despite the presumption of unit declines in tractor sales, not so much your unit declines, is that -- I mean [indiscernible].
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, again, I think it's not a foolproof argument on my part. But the market still tends to be heavily weighted to field sales or field aftermarket sales. And I think that particular -- there are other regions, so for example, we talked to the strong -- not for a couple of quarters, and relatively talked to the strong European numbers. So I think there's a penetration argument still out there and some of these markets still remain unpenetrated. And again, I think that we can still go and sell it into an installed base. So we're not -- we're influenced by new equipment sales, but we're not wholly defined by that. We have a fair amount of capability going into the aftermarket. And either upselling people for manual guidance to kind of full blown guidance or there has been -- or selling them new technology versus the old technology. So again, I think that we're influenced by new current sales, but we're not a captive of that particular statistic.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And just wanted to get a sense on margins. [indiscernible] talked about an incremental operating margin target of 25%. It hasn't been brought up in a while, but I don't know if there's any reason why that should have changed. Is that a good target to think about when we look out in future years, 2014 perhaps and beyond?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. I think there's no law of nature defining this. I think we have to go out and hustle. But I think over the next 2 or 3 years is certainly our internal drive, our management level point of focus is taking that higher gross margin that we're now enjoying, the 56% to 57% gross margin, and then start rationalizing the expenses, the items between gross margin and operating, working to keep R&D somewhere around 13% of revenue, but looking to the sales, marketing and G&A categories and saying, "Okay, how do we use scale here to actually improve our relative efficiency on that?" If you look at where we were pre-2008 in terms of that measure. We've been there before. I think we can regain it, not instantly. But I think it's more of that mechanism than simply putting a number out there or so. Not kind of committing to any number in the next year, but basically saying there is reason to expect us to improve. And if you do the arithmetic, improve by maybe 2 to 3 points of operating. So kind of from the current level of 20%, 21%, I guess, is the 24% operating margin within the set of future expectations at Trimble? It very well could be. Now at the same time, as we enter some product categories that carry with them a different model, I'm going to be changing my story a bit. But with this portfolio, yes, we probably have that sort of capability available to us if we worked hard.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay, good. So again, happy Halloween and talk to you next quarter.
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Courtney, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Willa McManmon, you may begin your conference.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. Good afternoon. Today, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in our earnings press release and web tables, which are available on our website at www.trimble.com. We'll also make forward-looking statements, including our expectations for second half 2013 financial results. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. The periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q, discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking comments. A replay of this call is available by phone and on our website. Dial-in information is contained in our earnings press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. The issues that impacted us in the first quarter remained with us in the second quarter. These revolved around inconsistent market conditions in multiple regions, deferrals of investment due to continuing economic uncertainty, harsh weather and confusion around government funding sources. Revenue growth of 11.3% to $576 million was consistent with our expectations, and a non-GAAP operating margin of 20.9% continued our bottom line progression. The second quarter provided additional evidence of the ongoing development of the Trimble financial model. The non-GAAP gross margin exceeded 56% for the first time since we started reporting non-GAAP gross margin in 2006, which reflects the increasing value of content being provided by bundles of hardware, software and services. The deferred revenue balance also established a new threshold exceeding $200 million for the first time, driven by greater recurring revenue and more enterprise sales. The non-GAAP operating expense level was at 35.4% of revenue, with the increase entirely due to the impact of recent acquisitions. As we discussed in prior calls, the opportunity for us is to bank the higher gross margins and to work expenses as a percentage of revenue down to historical levels, providing operating margin lift. We expect to achieve this leverage without reducing the current relative R&D spending level, which was slightly over 13% of revenue in the second quarter. The regional results for the quarter reflected the uncertainty we are experiencing in the market, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pacific. European sales were up strong double digits year-to-year in spite of the still dismal state of the economy. This was virtually all organic growth and reflected comparatively strong agriculture sales, increasing penetration of a difficult construction market with technology and expansion in the mobile space. We do not believe the underlying economy provided any lift and won't for at least for the remainder of the year. Asia-Pacific, which has been a robust market for us, fell 4% year-to-year, with the majority of the drop occurring in Australia, which is in recession, with particularly severe ramifications for construction. E&C segment revenue grew at 10% year-over-year. Although this remains short of the segment's potential, it is nonetheless meaningful because it was generated in spite of market headwinds, which centered on government funding, unusually poor weather and in different market conditions in a number of regions. The message from the worldwide E&C market remains mixed. On the one hand, the distribution channel was able to identify a significant pipeline and is often quite positive about prospects. On the other hand, the backlog of signature-ready projects awaiting approval is high against historical standards and reflects uncertainty in the desire to defer investment decisions while awaiting greater clarity. Construction in general provided most of the E&C revenue lift and appears to be firming up despite some regional issues. Heavy civil grew in North America and Europe and declined year-to-year in Asia-Pacific, primarily as a result of the serious economic slowdown in Australia. Australia is a disproportionate factor for heavy civil as it was an early adopter market and has become the second largest national market for us for construction machine control after the U.S. The implicit good news in for instance that it reflects the market potential for the rest of the world, as the rest of the world catches up to Australian adoption rate. In addition to Australia, both Germany and Canada, which tend to be major contributors to the heavy civil business, are struggling to maintain traditional growth rates. We currently expect heavy civil to step-up to a higher growth rate in the second half the year from the first half, although the market remains difficult to forecast with precision. Building construction is currently growing faster than heavy civil, partly as a result of a slowly improving commercial and residential market in the U.S., partly as a result of the increasing general adoption of BIM or BIM-enabled tools and partly through early traction from the synergistic portfolio of capabilities Trimble has assembled around the constructible model. The current state of the building construction market is hardly robust and does not compare to the market in 2007 and early 2008. Nonetheless, the building and construction market provides us with a workable platform and the potential for continued growth for the remainder of the year and stronger growth in 2014 when more of the effect of our strategy will be seen in operating results. The survey instruments business recovered somewhat from first quarter performance levels, but continues to struggle against our historical standard of growth. North America provided some growth, but was limited by direct and indirect sequester-related constraints in federal, state and local spending. Europe was comparatively flat, but remains a challenging survey market with a general reluctance to invest in the private sector and an austerity-driven inability to spend in the public sector. The Chinese market, which has been a driver of strong growth for survey instruments over the last 10 years, is encountering a significant slowdown of government payments, which is limiting the ability to process new orders. Last quarter, we expected that some of these issues, particularly the U.S. sequester and Chinese payment issues, to be resolved relatively quickly with some potential of increased growth in the second half. This does not appear to be happening, and our revised expectations that survey will now be relatively flat in the second half and to be a relative drag on the E&C segment. The combined picture for heavy civil, building construction and survey leads us to expect E&C to generate better results in the second half of the year than the first, although not as strong as we anticipated earlier in the year because of the uncertainties of the survey instruments business. Second quarter results for the Field Solutions segment were disappointing, with a revenue decline of 6% year-to-year. Although Agriculture declined slightly year-to-year, the majority of the segment's revenue decline came from GIS, which continued to be impacted by the pullback of government funding sources. We saw significant GIS declines in the U.S., China and Europe. The impact of the U.S. sequester had both direct and indirect impacts. The slowness in payment by the Chinese government had a chilling effect similar to the one we are experiencing in survey and the effects of European government austerity are impacting relevant new GIS investment. The Agriculture revenue story vary geographically. North American revenue declined year-to-year, while revenue from other geographies grew, with Europe growing in strong double digits. We believe both the North American and European markets were heavily impacted by market distortions caused by unusual weather conditions, which delayed and compressed the planting season to a very short period. In addition, we had some U.S. sales deferred out of the second quarter as farmers anticipated new product releases which will occur later in the year. The U.S. farm market is currently unsettled, and we are assuming this will continue into the second half. As a result, we have scaled back our original expectations for Agriculture for the second half of the year while awaiting further clarity in the U.S. Our expectations for the rest of the world remain optimistic, and the blended view is that Agriculture will grow in the upper-single digits in the second half. Mobile Solutions revenue was up 42% for the total year and the non-GAAP operating margins improved to 14.2%. While year-to-year comparisons are influenced by acquisition effects, the underlying trend line for the segment remains positive, particularly in the transportation and logistics market. This market is in many ways analogous to the construction market. Both are highly competitive traditional industries in which the participants are under severe margin pressure with the additional burden of growing regulation in trucking. In both cases, the adoption of technology is seen as a primary mechanism for improving productivity, eliminating waste, ensuring regulatory compliance and achieving competitive differentiation. We have built the capability to be a central source for providing this leverage to the transportation enterprise. The Advanced Devices segment, again, provided relatively strong performance, with 10% year-to-year revenue growth and strong operating margins. This increase was due primarily to increased sales of RFID and military components and subsystems. Last quarter, we believe we retained a window to achieve the second half expectations we had established at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter guidance, we are tuning this expectation down to a more conservative level. The primary reasons for doing these are the GIS market difficulties, the current market ambivalence we are seeing in survey instruments, the uncertainties in the U.S. agricultural market, and the relatively recent challenges in the Australian and Chinese markets. On a concluding note, our CFO search has been underway for a number of weeks. We have a search firm engaged, which is conducting a nationwide search and some initial interviews with candidates have been held. Early evidence suggest a positive outcome. In the meantime, Julie Shepard is acting as our Interim CFO. She has been Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer since 2006. Let me turn the call over to her.
Julie A. Shepard: Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, I will be covering non-GAAP numbers today. The GAAP numbers, as well as the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP are detailed in our earnings press release. Because the financial data by segment is available in the earnings press release, I will be covering other relevant data and giving guidance for the third quarter of 2013. Overall, revenue was $576.3 million, up 11%. By geography in the second quarter, 56% of revenue came from North America; 23% from Europe; 14% from Asia-Pacific; and 7% from rest of the world. Company non-GAAP gross margin was 56.2%, up 1.8 points over the prior year, primarily due to product mix, including higher margin software and subscription revenue. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expense was $203.8 million or 35.4% of revenue, up as compared to $176.4 million or 34.1% in the second quarter of 2012 primarily due to acquisitions. Second quarter non-GAAP operating income was $120.3 million or 20.9% of revenue as compared to $105.2 million or 20.3% of revenue in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding acquisitions, non-GAAP operating margin was 21.5%. Foreign currency fluctuations had minimal impact on the quarter. Revenue was favorably impacted by approximately $1.5 million and non-GAAP operating income was favorably impacted by less than $300,000. Non-GAAP nonoperating income was $3.3 million, down as compared to $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2012, with the biggest delta due to higher interest expense associated with our debt increase. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2013 was 20% as compared to 16% in the corresponding period in 2012, primarily due to a discrete item related to an acquisition, as well as some differences in the geographical mix of pretax income. Non-GAAP net income of $98.6 million was up 7% as compared to the second quarter of 2012. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.38 compared with diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.36 in the second quarter of 2012. We finished the quarter with $129.1 million in cash and $899.2 million in debt on a multiple of 2.0x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operations was $134.7 million and on a year-to-date basis has self-corrected as the first quarter was unusually low due to higher working capital associated with sales linearity. Accounts receivable was $356.3 million and days sales outstanding was 56 days as compared to 64 days in the first quarter of 2013 due to better linearity, and was consistent with 56 days in the second quarter of 2012. Inventory in the second quarter of 2013 was $258.7 million compared to $260.6 million in the first quarter of 2013. Turning now to our guidance. For the third quarter of 2013, we expect revenue to be between $555 million and $565 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.18 to $0.20 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.36 to $0.38. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $42 million related to previous acquisitions, anticipated acquisition cost of $4.5 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $9.3 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 16% to 18% tax rate and 261 million shares outstanding. With that, we will take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cox.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: My first question is on the double-digit revenue growth expectation for the back half the year. You called out a number of areas of potential weakness as reflected in your guidance. But I was hoping you could maybe give a little more detail as to where you see the acceleration in growth? I think you called out building construction as one. But if you could maybe just shed a little more light there, that would be great.
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. Yes, I think, the word acceleration maybe requires a fair amount of context definition relative either prior -- to prior year or to kind of what we've seen thus far. But where we see the relative -- some relative, let's call it momentum second half compared to first half would be within the E&C segment, both heavy civil and building construction, I think, both are -- have some difficult markets out there starting with Australia and then into Europe. But in general, I think that we have a sense that the -- those 2 will be stronger in the second half than in the first half. A general view with a fair number of moving parts associated with both. I think survey, in terms of dialing back expectations a bit in the -- for the second half compared to earlier expectations, survey is not rebounding as quickly as we had expected last quarter. I think -- the sequester effects in the U.S. are not getting resolved as quickly as we anticipated. And it now seems as though the reset in terms of getting back a little bit more certainty will take place at the beginning of the federal fiscal year, which would be October 1. And the flow-through effect on survey, direct effects and more to the point, I think, the indirect effects of sequester in the U.S. is still impacting survey sales. And then, I think, in general, the -- Europe is a difficult market for survey. So overall, we see E&C kind of reflecting second half momentum relative to first half. But I think, again, it requires a story. Field Solutions, I think GIS is just simply going to have a difficult year. GIS of all our businesses is most exposed to government spending. And I think the government spending around the world at this point in time is creating difficulty. So I think GIS is simply going to have a difficult year. But then in Agriculture, which first quarter we had a number of effects, weather being a primary one. Those effects continued in the second quarter. But in general, I think our outlook is stronger for Ag in the second half versus the first half. So net-net, we expect, let's call it, greater momentum in the second half for Field Solutions than we did in the first half. I think the Mobile Solutions segment, a number of acquisition effects in there, but I would say is -- second half will look much like the first half with some secular trends in there. In Advanced Devices, not a major, major, major mover here, but again, I think Advanced Devices will be a steady Eddie in the second half. So again, we're backing off a bit from the kind of the early in the year expectations for the second half, but still looking for double-digit third quarter and also anticipating more or less the same in the fourth quarter. So the second half should look somewhat similar to the first half, but maybe with some upside potential.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. The acceleration comment was pertaining more to the -- on the organic growth side since you had more of that in the first half.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Okay. Yes, and I'd say what I said would -- it relates to organic growth as well.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Sure. And then one just quick follow-up question on the Ag side. You called out some revenue being held up in anticipation of some new products. Can you speak to those introductions?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Well, I don't want to kind of compound the problem by preannouncing product. But there was some -- we shared some pre-disclosure information with distribution partners, and it to some extent leaked out into the marketplace, which -- hard to quantify, but there were some movement from second quarter into the second half of the year as people waited on new products. So beyond that, I can't be much more specific other than say that, obviously, there will be some new product introductions in the second half of the year in Ag.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rich Valera.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to follow-up on the Ag growth question. Just wanted to be clear on what you were thinking about the product sales that were deferred due to the delayed planting season. Do you still think you're going to kind of get some catch-up sales in the second half, or do we think something else is going on there?
Steven W. Berglund: No, I think -- first of all, this is such a seasonal business just looking at it sequentially probably doesn't lead to necessarily robust conclusions. So I think what we're expecting is, on the year-to-year basis, that will return to a more consistent pattern where third quarter this year compared to third quarter last year will start to look -- the growth will be there more to historical patterns. I think the relative distortion occurred in the first half, but I don't think there will be any -- I don't think -- we're not counting on what's called a whole lot of movement from the first half into second half. I think it'll just revert to more historical patterns. The summer and the fall purchasing patterns will stay at the summer and fall purchasing patterns. And then hopefully, to a more normal weather pattern next -- early next year will revert to a traditional spring pattern. But I don't think we're anticipating spring buying kind of move into the summer and the fall. We just expect kind of a normal -- more normal seasonal pattern. That's what we're looking.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Looking bigger picture at Ag, what's your kind of conviction level that what's happening is in fact kind of temporary seasonal and maybe macro sort of cyclical pressures on that business, as oppose to penetration or secular issues? So I guess, particularly in North America where most of the trouble seems to be.
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. I think our forecasts all along have assumed that there are some secular trends that are taking place. And are in a sense are about to begin, if you will. So I think that in terms of relative penetration, yes, the U.S. is becoming a more penetrated market at least for certain product categories. That's been built into our expectations and to our longer-range forecast. So I think we're expecting that. At the same time is the avenues to growth for us going forward are more information products and there is getting to be more and more to say about that. It's also about looking to specialty crops such as sugar and other crops that are not particularly penetrated. So all along, I think if you go back and listen to what we've said for the last couple of years, yes, there's a secular trend of kind of traditional row crops becoming increasingly penetrated, but the growth pattern is also -- for us is going to be specialty crops, new information products. And then I think over the next few years is, let's call it, a relative conversion of our -- an intensification of the information management aspects as Agriculture turns into more and more of using the cliché of our times, more of a big data sort of problem. So I think we see a number of secular trends going on. Yes, they're at work, but I would say is the significant majority of kind of the year-to-year effect for us in the first half of the year was circumstantial, not structural and not kind of secular, although it's working in the background.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So I'm sure you're loath to make sort of long-term predictions at this point, but would it be fair to say that absent these fairly numerous sort of specific macro headwinds, which you've called out, which most of which seem to be at least somewhat temporary or cyclical in nature, that you still think you've got a double-digit kind of organic growth business here over, whatever you want to call it, the medium term?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So again, I think at the moment, it's easier to make the 3-year call than it is the 3-month call given kind of all the interdependencies and all the differing market conditions around the world at this point. But I would say, yes, the 3-year view is what we -- with the kind of puts and takes within the portfolio, I would say is the longer view, the 3-year view or the 1-year to 3-year view is that, with what is going and the underlying market potential and through a process of continual redefinition, creating more -- larger market to penetrate, I would say, yes, we're still rock solid on the idea that we're an organic double-digit growth company.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And just one more for me. Your 3Q guidance, the EPS guidance seems to imply either a sequential increase in gross margin or a decent sort of absolute dollar decrease in OpEx. I guess, any color there at all? And should we assume lower OpEx levels then going forward from there? Any help on the OpEx line?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think in the second quarter, you did have some trade show activity. In the third quarter, you're going to have the lack of the trade show activity. You're also going to see the summer effects lower -- as vacations kick in, those will not be hitting the P&L. They'll be working off of the balance sheet. And so I think that the third quarter is generally a low-expense period. As far as gross margin, I think it gets into the kind of the esoterics of product mix as much as anything else, so I don't necessarily want to get overly specific on gross margin. But I think that you will see a general seasonal effect on operating expenses in the third quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to get a little bit of additional color in terms of the size of the GIS business and maybe what your thoughts are in terms of that business coming back? I mean, it feels like we might not see that until the fourth quarter. But could you see projects get canceled or is this a situation where we are seeing delays? Just want to understand that a little bit better.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so first of all, the -- we are not wanting to breakout the internals to a segment. GIS is the minority partner to Ag in that segment. I think -- okay, first of all, I think the -- one of the aspects of this current environment, we can see quite a bit of pipeline. We can see a lot of projects out there. We can see a desire to fund. Again a desire to move ahead. The funding is simply when -- is not being produced on a timely basis. So again, if you want the pipeline, we're simply not seeing the funding come through for that. So I think that's the government effect, government funding effect. In the U.S., it's yes, sequester, but then I think that a lot of the funding takes place at the state or local level, and the state and local authorities are not sure about their federal funding. And so therefore, there tends to be a little bit of a gridlock affect. So I think that it could come back in the fourth quarter or subsequent to October 1 new fiscal year in the U.S., greater certainty and the rest. China, we're still viewing as something of a short-term issue just from the standpoint that money is not flowing from the central government in China, whether that's related to the liquidity issues or whether that is related to something else, is not totally clear. The effect is that new projects are not necessarily getting funded until the old projects are being paid for. And so, I think, there are a lot of different circumstances around the world. At the same time if you look at GIS, you step back from GIS and look at it against the secular sort of background, there are things occurring in GIS. I think over the years, we have been talking about them, not necessarily every quarter, but we've been talking about them. So I think that we are heavy on the data collection side, we have traditionally built handhelds with some significant software content on the handheld. So in this day and age of the more muscular handset, there's been the issue that we recognized years ago in terms of, okay, whether being a specialty handset -- handheld provider, how viable that is in the long term? And I think we're becoming -- we've been recognizing that and been doing a couple of things, while still building handheld data collection devices. We have been verticalizing the business. So over the last few years, you've heard us talk more and more about things like electrical utilities, natural resources, water management. And all of those are in some sense spinoffs of this GIS business that we're verticalizing and adding more software content and in some sense becoming more hardware agnostic. So I think that over time, the GIS business is going to morph into something that is much more software-centric and less hardware-centric. That is occurring, and so I think there are some secular trends there that we're seeing that we're including in the forecast. I think the current problem is just more -- is less of that occurring, that's occurring in background. But I think the current issue with GIS is simply a matter of lack of funding sources from -- or lack of reliable funding sources from government.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. Got it. And just in terms of the building information modeling market, just wanted to get a sense from you, have we seen sort of further progression in terms of the adoption? I mean, there's a lot of surveys out there that talk about how it's being pretty broadly utilized at this point. And just maybe how -- an update on how that business has done?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think we're -- from our standpoint, it's still relatively early days in kind of the BIM world. Adoption is increasing at a rapid rate. And we're seeing strong growth in somewhat non-traditional markets. Places like India are actually quite strong markets for BIM in a sense. I suppose jumping generations of technology and kind of going to state-of-the-art technology in one jump in places like India. But -- so I think there's a background here of greater adoption kind of greater engagement, and I think a recognition by C-level suites in the construction industry that it's no longer a nice to have, it's no longer a discretionary sort of expenditure. I think as the technology is becoming more and more of a survival issue for most contractors, so I think the adoption level is increasing. I think where we as a company are quite encouraged is the pieces we put together over the last few years, which is more kind of a BIM 5D world, which is the 3 dimensions that you can -- X, Y and Z in the model, plus schedule, plus cost management. And putting -- we've put together the elements of this. Over the next 2, 3 years we're going to build a stronger platform around building the entire product suite around, let's call it, the constructible model becoming more and more relevant to the contractor. And we're quite encouraged by, let's call it, relatively early, but relatively strong response from the marketplace in terms of kind of grasping the totality and starting to talk in terms of the wider suite of capabilities, not just the kind of the three-dimensional aspect, which is pretty obvious and pretty intuitive. But I they think the more advanced contractors are seeing the potential of the entire technology suite, not just one element of it. So I think we are seen traction. The market isn't necessarily cooperating all that well. It's hard point anywhere in the world at this point in time where you could call the commercial and residential construction market robust. But it is got good enough to give us a platform to work from.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrea James.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Can we unpack Mobile Solutions a little bit? It seems -- you've had 8 quarters of good sequential improvements. And it seems like you're continuously adding new enterprise suites. So I guess my question's twofold. First, do you have a sense of your penetration among large enterprise suites? And then second, you've got a competitor that's focusing on using smartphone apps for fleet management. I was wondering if you see that as a threat to your business, I guess, which is more hardware focused?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So starting with the smartphone. I mean, I think the market does segment in terms of different solution sets for different needs or different sets of perceived needs. So I think there -- certain elements of the market are certainly appropriate for a smartphone application, and we may end up participating in that segment. But I think where we're -- our relative point of focus, our relative emphasis is on becoming more and more relevant to the enterprise. So I think if you look at the needs of truckers today is, or transportation companies in general and logistics providers today, they're being -- they've got a heavy compliance requirement in terms of maintaining driver's logs and the like. That they are governmental regulations requiring them to be more and more certain about the status of vehicle, but also the status of the driver. And so I think there's a whole, whole, whole realm of requirements there that, okay, may or may not be satisfied by a smartphone application. But then you look to the deeper needs of the industry. And one of the constraints of the industry is actually of truck -- availability of drivers themselves. It's not a lifestyle that people are committing to for a lifetime. And so I think if you talk to trucking companies, they are very much -- they would very much view the constraint as being -- one of their constraints as being the availability of drivers. And then that leads into, okay, how do you schedule your trucks? Are there innovative things you can do to schedule routes, schedule drivers against those routes in order to take some of the stress off the drivers and maybe allow them to maintain a more coherent lifestyle. So I think there are a lot of intricacies in the industry that have to be solved. I think that the combination of people in that, TMW and now ALK, were able to engage the enterprise more completely. So I would say, I won't dismiss the smartphone application, that's appropriate for a number of applications. But I would say in terms of attempting to solve the larger enterprise problem for these transportation companies, I think it requires a lot more than simply a smartphone app. Now as far as penetration -- well, first of all, that will vary around the world, but then I think that -- yes, most trucking fleets have, let's call it, a dot on a map solution at this point in time. So if you simply talk about penetration of having some kind of hardware on the truck that determines location and maybe elements of status. The market is relatively penetrated in that sense. But if you go -- if you talk in terms of the wider definition of adding value that includes both location, but also status and context, the market still has a lot of penetration potential available. And I would not describe it as being a market that is close to penetration once you adopt that definition.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Just one more on Ag. I appreciate that. Some of the -- I was wondering if you could capture some of the as yet untapped opportunity in Ag? Like are you thinking about livestock solutions and herd management at all? I don't know if I've ever heard Trimble talk about that. And then also could you talk if you're seeing any meaningful contribution yet from sugar crops?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Not to in any way sound kind of dismissive, but I guess we'll talk about herd management when we actually have a product to talk about. So are we considering things like herd management? The answer would be yes. I think what we're working to is a, it's called a prioritization of need. And I would say in terms of looking at market potential, I think this idea that every square meter under cultivation in the world has a rich information ecosystem attached to it that can be exploited. I think that to us would be the larger priority at the moment, and less so tracking cows or tracking livestock. Sorry, Andrea, what was your second -- what was your other question?
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Sugar.
Steven W. Berglund: Oh, sugar.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: You guys announced a partnership with U.S. Sugar a while ago. I was wondering if you're seeing it...
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, yes, I mean, I don't want to discuss U.S. Sugar's business or actually what we're doing in other places such as Brazil. That starts to get to be a little proprietary. Let's just say is -- what -- both U.S. Sugar, which is public, and then the ones that are not public. I think those tend to be, let's call it, the kind of more of the Connected Farm variety. If you look at you at U.S. Sugar and their operations as both -- yes, they grow hundreds of thousands of acres of sugarcane, but they also have a processing plant in effect. They have a railroad. They have a lot of vehicles. They have a lot of workers that they'd like to keep track of. And so here is a case that we find very attractive because Trimble as an enterprise, not just the straight agricultural elements of instrumentation put on a tractor, but in terms of the larger enterprise, Trimble has a lot to say to somebody like U.S. Sugar in terms of vehicle tracking or employee tracking or even potentially helping manage their railroad operations. So I think the potential for an account like that or other accounts is really what -- where we're driving as a company is to operate more at an enterprise level, more as a complete solutions provider. So I would say is -- I would characterize the relationship with sugar in general and U.S. Sugar specifically as progressing, still under development in some cases. But I think the key thing here is, it really is an enterprise-level engagement, not simply a product sale.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Seems a bit different for you guys, like that seems to be sort of maybe where things might go in the future in terms of some of these whole enterprise-to-enterprise solutions, just interesting.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. And I think that actually is a key point in terms of looking to the future is -- and the unfortunate factor is a lot of the business we're doing, we can't press release. But there is a lot of what's called enterprise-to-enterprise engagement going on, where we're providing something more than just product. We're providing product. We're providing the software that integrates with the enterprise solution, whatever that may be. And increasingly, there's an element of professional services involved in what we're doing. So I think that represents a major fact for Trimble going forward is stepping up and becoming more of an enterprise-level solution, not in an ERP sense, but in terms of providing more than just product to some of these larger enterprises.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Just a quick clarification in Ag, basically -- I understand the 3-year growth scenario, but you were expecting the second half of the year Ag growth to offset the weakness in GIS to give you positive top line growth maybe in the mid-single digits next couple of quarters, is that a fair statement?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I don't think we're not providing guidance for the segment, but we're talking about the company, and we expect Ag -- what we are saying is that Ag will grow in the second half relative -- which is contrast a bit to the first half, but not necessarily saying anything at the segment level in total.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And how big is the survey part of E&C the part that you'll regain. I mean, how much of that did you represent?
Steven W. Berglund: Again, we don't breakout the internals to the segments. But I would say, survey is now, again, a minority of the total, but still a substantial part of the segment.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And that business has to grow double-digit in order for the corporation to grow double-digit effectively in the second half, is that's a fair statement of what you expect? And can you maintain the profitability in the E&C business that we saw? It was very strong in the second quarter. I assume you're expecting it to stay the same if not improve?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I'd say the model, we're quite content with how the model, financial model of the company is playing out. So yes, we've been under some revenue pressure, but pretty much across the board, margins are holding up or actually margins are improving in some cases. So I wouldn't want to necessarily, again, provide guidance segment-by-segment, but I would say there is no reason to expect that kind of seasonally adjusted the E&C margins are going to be under any particular pressure for the rest of the year. But again, I think there are sometimes seasonal issues. But year-over-year, I would still say that there's no reason to expect any major degradation really for E&C or Field Solutions or for that matter, Mobile Solutions. So I think we're -- from a profitability standpoint, I don't think that we're under any particular pressures at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Spinola.
Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Steve, I was wondering if you could elaborate on your comments about the Chinese government payments. Is this something where they're not funding existing projects or is it, money is not flowing to new projects? And is this -- was this pervasive throughout Q2? Just anything. Do you expect China to continue to slow in Q3? What's happening in that market?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think to some extent, it's hard to be categorical as to exactly what's happening. I mean, we talked about China a bit for the first quarter results indicating what appear to be a bit of a hiatus. And with the new government, part -- one of the explanations I'm sure buried in all this is that the new government has not made its priorities absolutely clear. And so the bureaucracy has not yet kind of reacted to a new set of priorities because they're not yet fully clear. So that's part of it. But I think that -- and what we're seeing in a number of different cases is that for work already completed, is the -- the Chinese government is kind of slow on paying its bills at this point in time. And as a result, that's keeping kind of new projects from kind of being put out there and being funded simply because the old projects are not necessarily getting cleared at this point in time. So the presumption is that, that is a short-term phenomenon. I think it's generally being seen by a lot of different companies working in China at this point in time. It's just the slowness of payment by the national government. And so I think that there's a knock-on effect from that, and I think we're seeing that. So I think the key element here is simply the Chinese government paying its bills.
Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And just to clarify, this is their being slow to pay your customers, correct? You don't have any receivables that are aging because of this lack of payment?
Steven W. Berglund: Not to any historically -- not deviating anywhere from the historical, so there's -- the Chinese government is good for the fund, it's more of a timing issue. And -- but at the same time, we would be reluctant to kind of put new money after old. So there is a dynamic at work there. But there is not an accounts receivable issue. And I think this is just a timing issue. But it's affected us in the first quarter, it's affected us in the second quarter.
Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And just last one, last one for me. I think you mentioned that there's some strength in Ag in Europe and just as I'm trying to think about Ag across all of the markets. Maybe you put a little color around why you're seeing strength in that market when some of the others are weak?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think Europe -- first of all, Europe was not as strong as we actually expected in the second quarter because the weather didn't cooperate in Europe. At least earlier in the quarter, there was heavy flooding and farmers were kept out of the fields in Europe as they were in the U.S. early in the quarter. But I think Europe, over the last 6 or 7 years, Europe has been a strong secular growth player for us and has been a producer of significant growth with the Eastern Europe, where the farms tend to be larger being a still attractive largely unpenetrated market for us. So I would say what we saw in Europe in the second quarter is actually pretty consistent with history. And Ag at least thus far through the European economic troubles, has not seem to have been affected by the larger macroeconomics in Europe. So I would say the second quarter is in line with, let's call it, a multiple year history in Europe and really doesn't stand out that much, as I think the one that stands out is more of the U.S. in the second quarter, not Europe. And again for some specific reasons.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing.
Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: First question on gross margins. You were 80 basis points higher, so pretty nice. But service plus subscription only went up slightly. So is that largely driven by mix within each category and are these sort of sustainable trends going forward?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I think it's probably a kind of a danger with Trimble is to try to over intellectualize the aggregate gross margin for us as a company, because it largely is a product mix, business line mix sort of issue we have. From business-to-business, we have widely divergent gross margins. So the gross margin for the company tends to be more of arithmetic thing than necessarily a definitive answer. So I think the gross margin is indicative of what's going on in terms of higher and higher values, so I think it has meaning in that context. In any given quarter, to a degree of accuracy, it's probably not a definitive indicator of anything other than the business mix that's going on. So I would actually not put a whole lot of emphasis on the internals in the gross margin. For example, is that there's software in the product category. There's software in the subscription category. And as a result, I think the internal dynamics here will get a little confusing. But I would say, directionally, gross margin is going up for the company representing the greater value. And I think the internals are not necessarily significant in their own right.
Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, and my next question is your total government exposure, do you have a sense if that's over 10%. In the past you have given $50 million to $55 million just for the federal spending but, of course, there's state and municipal which use GIS solutions, as well as the China and Europe government exposure?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so I would say, well, 10% of the company would be something over $200 million at this point in time. We don't break it down. We don't pursue that number with any degree of rigor across the world. But if you took a fair piece of the survey business, if you took a more significant piece of the GIS business and threw in some of the heavy civil business which is infrastructure related. Yes, I think you start to -- in terms of direct, indirect and some of the indirect maybe 3 orders of magnitude away from the federal government, but ultimately a national government, whether here or elsewhere might be a big funder of it. So I would think, in a very rough sense, you could start to come up with a number that says direct funding, indirect funding or third order funding for the company. It might start to push a number that starts getting close to 10% of total revenue. Although, I couldn't be very specific about it simply because we don't track it at that level.
Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then last question, you talked about some region-specific headwinds that seem to have an endpoint, whether it's U.S. sequester or China payment issues. For the Australia recession, is that largely related to resource extraction for the Asia market or is that more of a near-term headwind with the elections coming and some political uncertainty there?
Steven W. Berglund: I think a little bit of both. Certainly, Australia was a counter example to the rest of the world kind of in the 2008, 2009 timeframe where because of the extraction and that they we're able to kind of draft on Chinese economic growth there. So I think the extraction industries are there at the center, somewhere. But I think the relative hope or the relative possibility here later in the year is, I think, that with an election coming up, I think the potential new government, I think, has been more explicit about plans to invest in public infrastructure. So I think there -- with a possible change in government coming in Australia, I think towards the latter part of the year, now this would not probably affect us in 2013, it might in 2014. I think there is some sense as there might be a greater tendency to build public-financed infrastructure in Australia regardless of what's happening in the mining industry. And so I think that there is some sense is that our fortunes could potentially improve with a change of government in Australia, but we'll just have to wait and see.
Operator: And at this time we have no more questions. Thank you for joining the call.
Steven W. Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: And once again, this does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Angela and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Ms. McManmon, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. Good afternoon. This afternoon, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in our earnings press release and web tables on our website at www.trimble.com. We'll also make forward-looking statements, including our expectations for second quarter 2013 financial results. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. The periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q, discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking comments. A replay of this call is available by phone and on our website. Dial-in information is contained in our earnings press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. Although our first quarter revenue was disappointing, we do not believe the fundamentals in our market have changed, and our long view of growth and profitability remains unchanged. Our guidance entering the quarter was intended to be conservative and reflected the cautious buying behavior we were observing in our markets coming out of 2012, what we did not adequately anticipate in the guidance where the effects of the U.S. sequester, harsh weather conditions that continued into late spring in North America and Europe, and worsening economic conditions in Australia. The uncertainties we encountered in the first quarter have influenced our guidance for the second quarter, which reflects what we consider to be a conservative perspective that assumes terrible days of uncertainties. We are receiving some early encouragement as partial first month results in April are significantly stronger than at the same point in January. Although our view of the second half of the year has to be highly conditional at this point, we believe we have a path for delivering full-year earnings consistent with our original beginning of the year expectations and second half revenue consistent with our original expectations for the back half. The sequester had a meaningful negative impact on E&C and Field Solutions segment revenue, although it is impossible to pinpoint precisely what the full magnitude of sequester effects. Company-wide, our identifiable sales to the U.S. government generally run at between $50 million and $50 million -- $50 million and $55 million a year. Beyond that quantifiable level, the U.S. government provides direct or indirect funding for a significant number of our users who provide goods and services to all levels of government. The range of responses coming from U.S. agencies in response to the sequester has been variable. In some cases, federal agencies have effectively shut down buying activities until the end of the second quarter with the implication of catch-up purchasing after that. In other cases, there has been no clear indication. This general confusion has created a chilling effect on the extensive food chain our providers of goods and services to the government, making it hard to separate an intention to buy from the intention to buy coupled with the ability to buy. In the short term, this chilling effect is impacting our survey and GIS businesses, both of which had difficulties in the quarter. The flat year-to-year Field Solutions revenue reflected a decline in GIS revenue, which is dependent on government funding sources, and single-digit growth in agriculture revenue. The agriculture revenue story vary geographically. Revenue outside of North America increased by over 30% year-to-year, but declined in North America. We believe the North America decline's largely attributable to a very late planting season. Although Europe grew, its growth rate was also impacted by the late spring. To provide some context, the April 21 USDA weekly crop cargo set update estimates that the 18 states that account for 92% corn acreage had planted 4% of the acreage. The 4% planting coverage this year compares to 26% at the same point in 2012 and a 5-year average of 16%. The picture is very much the same for spring wheat. The 6 days that account for 99% of wheat acreage have planted 7% of the acreage as of April 21. This compares to 52% in 2012 in a 5-year average of 24%. Although commodity farm -- although current farm commodity prices may be adding to a depressed farm psychology, we believe they are secondary to the weather factor. The split by agriculture and product category also reinforces the view better issues in agriculture are circumstantial and not structural. Out-of-guidance and information management products provided double-digit growth year-to-year. The lower-priced manual guidance products was the category that struggled compared to the prior year. These products represent more of a real-time impulse buy compared to out-of-guidance and information management, which require a more extended and deliberate buying process not closely tied to real-time field conditions. With conditions not yet suitable for field work, the farmer has likely deferred the buying decision of these manual guidance products until field conditions improve. The other factor, which gives us real-time support for cautious optimism for agriculture, is that our positioning the services business, which sells correction signals for precision agriculture GPS receivers, is currently spiking against any previous baseline, the entrances that we are seeing pent-up demand surfacing as farmers return to the field. Our assessment is that while the second quarter outcome will depend on how long weather conditions linger, we do expect agriculture will return to double-digit growth in the second half of the year. The relatively slow growth in the E&C segment reflected different stories among product categories. Building construction, which is centered on our initiatives, is generally staging a rebound from a 5-year market coma, driven by revival in the residential and commercial market. While it is premature to call the market robust, it is generally allowing us to grow at levels we haven't seen in years. Survey revenue was down year-to-year and reflected varying regional conditions. North America provided some growth but was limited by government spending in the late spring. Europe, China and Australia were all down year-to-year. China's issues are related to the transition of governmental leadership and may be short-term. Australia's are result of the mining recession. Europe's problems relate to its ongoing economic challenges, although a harsh winter also impacted activity. Even so, the market signals for survey are mixed. The distribution channel is not generally describing the market in overtly stressful terms and there seems to be a potential backlog of projects awaiting approval. In addition, our spare parts sales, which topogically, should be an early indirect indicator of an increased need for capacity are running at levels we haven't seen since at least 2008, having several grew slowly year-to-year with double-digit growth in North America and core market conditions in Europe and Australia. Both North America and Europe were impacted by the late spring with the resulting delay in construction activity. In addition, European conditions continue to reflect the weak economy. The Australian markets slowed with the falloff in mining activity. Even so, there appears to be a significant plan but unfunded project backlog, which could be released depending on Australian national elections in the second half of the year. Heavy civil spending was also impacted in the first quarter by the Bauma trade show, which was held in April in Munich. Bauma is the largest construction show in the world and is held every 3 years. It almost certainly pushed some buying out of the first quarter into the second quarter. Our overall expectation is that E&C will generate better results in the second half of the year. Mobile Solutions revenue was up 41% for the total year and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 11.3%. While year-to-year comparisons are influenced by acquisition effects, the underlying trend line for this segment remains positive, particularly for the transportation and logistics market. With the recent acquisitions of TMW and ALK, we now have a unique and comprehensive solution for transportation companies, which we can leverage. Strategically, this business has never looked stronger. Advanced Devices, again, broke its steady-state profile and grew by 15% year-to-year with strong operating margins. This relatively uncommon phenomenon resulted from particularly strong -- and for our RFID, GPS and timing components and modules. Overall, our initial assumptions for total year 2013 have been challenged. Our original assumption was that 2012 results could provide a basic template for assessing 2013 with an adjustment for a worsened outlook for the European market. Our overall competitive product and marketing position remains, if anything, better than it was a year ago. Our second quarter guidance reflects uncertainty about how the effects of the first quarter will map onto the second quarter. The overall mood of the market seems to be in an in between state, expressing neither alarm nor much exuberance. Needless to say, the state is hard to quantify accurately. Given the ambiguity in the environment, we are taking cost containment steps to protect the financial model with the intention that core organic margins will improve under all foreseeable scenarios. Our basic franchise remains strong and will provide healthy growth over the long term. With the current environmental ambiguity, it is in some ways easier to predict 3 years out than it is 3 months out. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri: Good afternoon. As a reminder, I will cover the non-GAAP numbers today. The GAAP numbers, as well as a recommendation from GAAP to non-GAAP are dictated in our earnings press release. Today, we announced first quarter 2013 revenue of $556.1 million, up 11% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. First quarter 2013 non-GAAP operating income of $110.3 million was up 8% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8% of revenue as compared to 20.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Acquisitions were a drag on operating margins primarily due to the impact of deferred revenue haircuts, which should correct itself in the back half of the year. Non-GAAP net income of $97.9 million was up 12% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.38 compared with the diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 in the first quarter of 2012. The tax rate was 10% for the quarter, reflecting the R&D tax credit legislation that was passed in the first quarter of 2013 and was retroactive to 2012. E&C revenue was $266.9 million, up 7% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Growth in E&C revenue came primarily from global sales of building construction products and heavy, highway products in U.S., offset by softer sales in Europe and Australia. E&C non-GAAP operating margin was $45.8 million or 17.2% of revenue as compared to $42.8 million or 17.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Field Solutions revenue was $147.5 million, flat as compared to the first quarter of 2012. There was moderate growth in agricultural products sales offset by decline in the sale of GIS products. Field Solutions non-GAAP operating income was $60.2 million, up 40.8% of revenue as compared to $63 million or 42.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP operating margin was down primarily due to product mix of GIS sales. Mobile Solutions revenue was $110.2 million, up 41% as compared to the first quarter of 2012 due primarily to higher service and subscription revenue and the impact of acquisitions. Mobile Solutions in non-GAAP operating income was $12.5 million or 11.3% of revenue as compared to $8.2 million or 10.4% of revenue in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to leverage from increased revenue and product mix, including higher subscription revenue. Advanced Devices revenue was $31.6 million, up 15% as compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to stronger sales embedded in timing devices. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices were $7.3 million or 22.2% of revenue as compared to $4 million or 14.4% of revenue in the first quarter of 2012. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due to leverage on higher revenue and product mix. In the first quarter of 2013, 55% of revenue came from North America, 24% from Europe, 14% from Asia Pacific and 7% from the rest of the world. The year-over-year growth by region was 15% in North America, 2% in Asia Pacific, 10% in Europe and 3% the rest of the world. Non-GAAP operating expense for the first quarter of 2013 was $197.6 million or 35.5% of revenue, up from 34.1% of revenue in the first quarter of 2012 due primarily to acquisitions. Non-GAAP non-operating expense was $2.5 million, down as compared to $2.5 million in non-operating income in the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to less profitability from joint ventures and higher interest expenses. We finished the first quarter 2013 with $143.6 million in cash compared to $157.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our debt level was $920.4 million on a multiple of 2.1x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operations was $37.4 million versus $67.7 million in the first quarter of last year due to higher working capital needs. The higher working capital needs were driven by higher accounts receivables, reflecting the linearity of the quarter and the seasonal buildup inventories. Both our timing issues and cash flow in the second quarter should be strong as these self-correct. Accounts receivables for the first quarter 2013 was $388.9 million as compared to $324.7 million in the first quarter 2012. Day sales outstanding in the first quarter of 2013 was 64 days as compared to 57 days in the fourth quarter of 2012, and 59 days in the year-ago quarter, up due to linearity of sales and acquisitions. Inventory in the first quarter of 2013 was $260.6 million compared to $240.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, higher due to seasonal build and lower than forecasted sales. Deferred revenue at the end of the first quarter was at all-time high of $198 million, reflecting the mix shift to more software and service products. Moving on to guidance for the second quarter of 2013, we expect revenue between $570 million and $580 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.18 to $0.20 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.36 to $0.38. Non-GAAP guidance excludes amortization of intangible of $39.1 million related to previous acquisitions, anticipated acquisition cost of $4 million and anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $9.2 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 16% to 18% tax rate and 260 million shares outstanding. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions. The first, with respect to being able to potentially hit your original revenue targets in the back half, what gives you the confidence that the effects of the sequester that hit you in the first half will be mitigated or gone by then? I'm trying to understand the ag side of it, that seems like somewhat of a temporary phenomena than a more timing issue. But the sequester one seems like potentially more problematic to predict.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, and I think they were assuming that the sequester effect will hang around into the second half of the year, but we think that other parts of the business can take up the slack. So I would say GIS will struggle through the entire year. We generally don't talk much about GIS, but it is a comparable sizable business, quite profitable, but it is very much tied to government sources of funding, not just in the U.S., but around the world. So I think there is some ability for GIS to come back internationally outside of the U.S. But I think that we have to assume that GIS will probably struggle for the year because I think funding sources, whether they be federal, state or local, are probably suspiciously absent for them. So I think we've already assumed that. I think survey, which is also exposed, we're not assuming, let's call, a strong comeback. But I think that there is, again, there are international markets, there are places outside of the U.S. that we anticipate some recovery. And we also -- there was the combined effect, both in North America and in Europe, weather seems to be an easy cop-out, but in reality, the weather conditions really gave us arguably the harshest winter in Europe in 40 or 50 years and with some parts of the U.S. that wasn't too far from that. So we'll get some bounce as surveyors and others can get out in the field. But we're not -- the second half forecast is not really based on the sequester going away, and magically, I think it's getting better. We do expect a strong comeback in ag because we do believe that it was largely weather-related in North America in effect, and as I've said, as the international growth there was strong. Building construction is, seems to be gaining momentum and so we're anticipating growth there. And in heavy construction, we did not have a typical quarter for it either. A lot of that related to weather as well. And -- but we are gaining traction in the SITECH distribution channel. So we expect those factors to offset what's called the sequester effects, which, to some extent, have been baked into our original view of the world. I think the effects were stronger than we anticipated. And then we have the Mobile Solutions side providing some relative momentum as well. So we think that in the back half, we can compensate for any lingering sequester effects is the bottom line here.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: How about on the mining side? Can you give us an estimate of your exposure to the mining vertical throughout your different businesses and what your expectations are for a new recovery in the mining sector?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So we're not particularly exposed directly to mining. Part of the arrangement with Caterpillar, now going back to the first JV, which is more than 10 years ago, was that we don't market machine control for mining increment directly to the mining company. So it is not a direct market for us. Where we're seeing the effects, primarily in Australia and South Africa at this point in time as mines generally require roads and infrastructure being put into service for mines. And so that's where we're seeing the effects. It's not so much directly from the mines themselves, but the secondary effects of the infrastructure being put in to support the mines. So that was not an easy call to say when that will pass. I think there is a general consensus that there is an election in Australia in the second half of the year. There are a lot of projects, not mining related, but infrastructure projects that seem to be lined up, waiting for approval in Australia. And depending on what the election -- how the election turns out, a lot of those might be released later in the year. But we're not counting on the, what's called the -- an early revival in mining. But the effects are also secondary, not primary.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. And a final one for me. It sounded like you're seeing improving momentum as you move through April relative to what you saw in the March quarter. Can you talk about which segments, vertical geographies are, in fact, picking up relative to the first quarter levels?
Steven W. Berglund: I think compared to the first quarter, just as we had what was uncommon for us in the first quarter, was a -- talking about multiple businesses struggling. I think it can be said as that in the first few weeks of April that most of the businesses that had difficulties, including survey, for example, in the first quarter are showing early strength in the second quarter compared to where we were after a few weeks in January. So it's pretty much across the board.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: As you've talked about the outlook for 2013 in previous calls, you described it as a double-digit revenue growth year. And given the challenges you're facing the first half of the year, do you still feel comfortable with that assessment for the full year given the recovery you are anticipating in the back half?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think I'll let you do the arithmetic. You got the first quarter, we've given guidance for the second quarter and we're basically, when we talk about meeting the profile for the back half of the year as being consistent with what we said in January, that would tend to imply that we believe the second half of the year will be in the realm of 10% to 15% we had implied in January. So I think the arithmetic is comparatively straightforward.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And the comments on cost containment efforts, can you quantify those? And given that this is -- as you're laying this out a couple of quarter phenomenon, why take efforts to cut cost if the outlook -- longer-term outlook is still the same?
Steven W. Berglund: That's certainly an internally logical question. But I think it's just the factors that, okay, we're stating a belief in our expectations that our numbers roll off to for the second half of the year. I think the environment is still uncertain in terms of lingering effects of this, that or the other thing. And so I think that our first priority is to secure the financial model. And to secure the financial model, we've taken cost out. We've had a reduction in force already. We have cut back on discretionary spending just to ensure that whatever happened does happen the second quarter and in the second half of the year, that we're not compromising the financial model of the company. So if by implication, as if we do indeed do what we say we're going to do relative to revenue in the second half, that's going -- well, we've more or less secured as an upside bottom line on a scenario in the second half. But let's just call it the precautionary on our part and our commitment to securing the financial model, and just recognizing that the environment remains uncertain and preparing ourselves for just about anything.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And then one last quick question on the Bauma show. I know in years past or quarters past, you called out expenses related to some of these large trade shows. Will there be a margin hit to E&C in the June quarter for that?
Rajat Bahri: The big hit in Bauma, it's not as big as I mentioned that -- so but the Q2 revenue for E&C should be higher than Q1 as some of construction picks up. So I expect that the margins of E&C should improve from Q1 to Q2. Both trend factors should be higher revenue, and then as Steve mentioned, we have taken some precautionary cost measures as well. And so Bauma, yes, Bauma, just to give you that rough number, maybe a couple of million dollars expense in Q2.
Steven W. Berglund: And parenthetically, I think relative to Bauma, Bauma is a trade show where you are allowed to sell off the floor. The environment at Bauma was first of all, robust. And we had a good selling show off the floor in Bauma. Hopefully, that's indicative of the market, but -- so there'll be both, hopefully, a revenue kicker, as well as a cost kicker.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just in terms on the BIM market and some of the improvements that you saw in construction, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of how you're seeing that play out for the rest of the year and maybe to shed some thoughts around construction just given the sequestration impacts?
Steven W. Berglund: Sorry, but which impact?
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Sequestration.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. So I think first of all, in terms of construction, outside of kind of a survey, which is related to construction, if kind of a sequester environment hangs on through full year -- okay, we're likely to see some effects in particularly heavy civil. The U.S. has been underinvesting in infrastructure for some period of time and okay, at some point, Congress and the President are going to have to deal with that. So I think there's a longer-term issue here just in terms of underinvestment and probably, every individual in Washington will acknowledge that the country is underinvested in infrastructure, they simply cannot find an effective mechanism to deal with it. But I think -- and so I would say for beyond the effects of survey, I would say that the sequester is not yet a primary consideration for construction. What we are seeing both in the U.S. and internationally relative to construction, let's call it vertical construction, the construction of structures, is a relatively -- well, it's an improving environment. Again, it's nothing like 2006 or 2007. Maybe we'll never see those times again, but it is certainly better than the last 4 or 5 years that we've seen. So there are projects, there is a strong desire to invest in technology because the economics in construction still remain pretty Darwinian, is that for any kind of project comes up, the number of competing contractors for that project are likely to be 3x what you would've seen in say, 2007, 2008. So on the face of it, the economics are pretty brutal and contractors really have to cut deep in order to get the bid, which makes the technology very attractive both on the infrastructure side and on the vertical construction side. And really, I think the market premise for us is that only those contractors who embrace the technology will get the advantages, and therefore, be able to compete effectively in this fairly brutal market. So I think there is going to be a recognition that this is no longer nice to have but is absolutely vital, whether that be them or whether it'd be machine control or whether it'd be what we call the connected construction sites. So I think putting in, in jeopardy more sorts of terms, I think the crossing of the causal events is occurring now. And I think that it's getting a -- if I were -- opinion for it, I would say it would be a tidal wave of change in construction but there might be rhetorical overkill. But I think what we're seeing here is a fundamental change in the marketplace, and I think it will ultimately lead to kind of a restructuring in construction. But so I think there's a strong secular force towards the technology becoming a requirement not just, again, a nice to have. And I think that the market from the commercial and residential side, the market is continuing to heal. The market's continuing to start to show more, maybe more animal spirits, I think, projects are coming online, projects are being funded, projects are being initiated, which is where we come in. So I think the environment is improving, but I think there is another realm relative to the technology that's growing independent of the market conditions.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And just one sort of broader question on the agriculture market. If the planting season is delayed, does that potentially lead to an extension of the planting season in terms of just into more the third quarter, which is tradition, like it's offered as a shift in seasonality or is an agriculture effect?
Steven W. Berglund: So I think it shifts the seasonality from the first quarter into the second quarter. If we start talking the third quarter, we're talking about probably subsidy in plant size and such. But I think last year, for example, we had an elongated season where it started early and continued -- so we got an early start last year, so it's actually longer than normal last year. I think this year, it has been -- it'll be a much more truncated process where farmers just haven't been able to get out into the field until maybe the last week or so in a serious fashion in North America. So I think it'll be, let's call it more activity in a shorter period of time, but I don't think it necessarily gets -- the back end doesn't necessarily get extended out. I think there's going to be a whole lot more activity in the second quarter whereas it would historically have happened in the first quarter and the second quarter.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Fair enough. And last question would be, what was your organic growth rate on the quarter?
Rajat Bahri: So organic means, as we said, organic growth rate is probably going to be in the low single-digits in the first quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about what's going on and what you're seeing in the emerging markets, including China and Brazil?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so we're talking specifically about China and Brazil, is China certainly grew for us in the quarter. It grew significantly in E&C, but GIS actually struggled a bit in China in addition to North America. It struggled a bit in China. But overall, China grew for us. So I think China is going through something of a transition at this point in time. There's a lot of discussion about their macroeconomic situation. I think more to the point for us, whether they -- China grows at 3% or 7% or some other number doesn't necessarily make a whole lot of difference to us because it's more or less unbounded penetration potential. So I think the macroeconomics don't necessarily matter all that much to us in terms of where there's 1 number versus another. I think that there -- what we've seen for maybe the last year in China is with the change in government, both pre leading up to it and now, I think after the change in government occurred, things are still sorting out. So what we're seeing is certain things like relatively slow payment on projects simply because a new regime is taking place. So I think from our standpoint, China's taking a little bit of a pause. It did grow for us in the quarter year-to-year and we -- our fundamental outlook hasn't changed on China. But in terms of kind of gearing up and going on new projects, that is still in kind of a transition phase. I think that will sort itself out over the next 3 to 6 months. So China's still fundamentally a positive for us. Brazil also grew for us year-to-year, maybe heavy emphasis on agriculture in Brazil. Brazil is one of the prime markets for agriculture. It is becoming more and more important for us from an E&C perspective as Brazil, I think in the last few years, has gone to understand that its economic growth is going to be limited if it does not invest in infrastructure. So I would say that there is a significant commitment, newfound commitment in Brazil for infrastructure build, which will serve us. I think again, kind of maybe something of a parallel story to China, but kind of the Brazilian economy seems to be going through a bit of a hiatus at this point in time, struggling a little bit to kind of refine the significant growth rates that they've had until fairly recently. But for us, agriculture is a booming market for E&C infrastructure. There's a commitment to build infrastructure, so over the next few years, Brazil should be a very strong market for us on E&C as well. So we're bullish on both countries. Whatever the macroeconomics are, we think we've got a growth path in both countries.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: And for my second question, I guess I would've thought that some of the positives that you've got going on such as construction recovery and more verticalization ag, that would've offset some of what is negatively impacting the first half. And so my question is, does your confidence in the back half of the year come more from the sense that the negative impacts on the first half will mitigate or is that these positive trends will, I guess, show stronger fruit in the back half?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think it's a combination of both. So certainly, we're not expecting a transformation either for GIS, which will continue to be a problem for the total year probably, nor survey, which will probably recover in the second half of the year but I think within limits. I think we're looking at construction, so there's a -- there are clear trends for it. We're looking to agriculture to recover in the second half of the year pretty strongly. We're looking at the Mobile Solutions to continue whether it's become a secular trend there. So I think that the changes in strategy, for example, things like SITECH, things like the verticalization of -- that we've undertaken in construction will show progression, will add some momentum. But probably, the numbers are still kind of small enough as they may not move the needle. The other thing lurking in the background, which, given the issues of first quarter, didn't seem worthy to really articulate, that some of these smaller businesses that are operating in what we call the emerging businesses, things like railroads where we put a -- over the last few years, we put a significant corporate focus on railroads. Our sales to railroads, whether it be the Ministry of Rail in China, whether it be Doichiban [ph], whether it be some of the big southern in U.S., whether it be light rail in any number of cities, our sales of railroads in the first quarter were up very strong, approaching triple digits in year-to-year in first quarter. Small numbers but starting to add momentum. And I think we can start to point to what's called maybe not equal in traction from a numerical standpoint, but we can start to point to traction in categories like electrical utilities, like water management, like forestry, some of these smaller businesses that we're helping to become kind of franchise businesses for us. So those are adding momentum, not necessarily enough to kind of really be talking points in terms of moving the needle, but they are starting to add positive momentum to the underlying story of the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I had a question on -- a couple of questions on the ag business. And one of the things that's changed over the last 12 months is that Monsanto entered the precision planting side of the business. And so my question is given that the sales of planting-related products are concentrated in the first quarter, did the presence of that aggressive new player presumably trying to gain some share and whatnot, I mean did that have any impact at all on the quarter in your opinion?
Steven W. Berglund: No. So -- I mean Monsanto is pursuing a, call it -- or is articulating, let's call, a large strategy. I would say they got no effect on our first quarter. I mean it is -- they are not yet a factor in the precision agriculture market. And in reality, I think that the Monsanto larger question about the future of ag probably is more of a 3- to 5-year sort of question in terms of as agriculture becomes, let's call, a bigger -- big data sort of opportunity. I think that's what Monsanto and others are putting in us for that matter, are talking about here. But so I don't think Monsanto's not a factor in the first quarter at all.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then the other question is just on the OEM side of your business. Sales have actually looked pretty good for the OEMs that have reported numbers so far, and obviously, Case New Holland out this morning was pretty good growth numbers in unit volumes. So my question is, did that impact -- how does your OEM business compare with your aftermarket business in the quarter and how that impact the numbers?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, we're a mix of selling factory installed units and the aftermarket. And I articulated relative to the kind of the breakdown by product category to at least indirectly deal with that point, is the upscale products, the automatic items are -- where the system takes control of the steering, takes control of the throttle, as well as information into our products, we're comparatively strong. Those did grow meaningful double digits in the quarter, which would be largely related -- let's call it the factor that would relate to kind of keeping OEM as an indicator. That will be consistent where we had issues where the more aftermarket-centric products, the annual guidance where it's essentially self-install, it doesn't control the steering but simply gives the operator kind of turn left, turn right queues. That, I think, is much more of a box sell. A farmer walks into a feed store or some other form of retail potentially locked up with a box under his or her arm and then self-installs. Well, when they're not in the field, they're not motivated to do that. So I would say it's actually -- it may not appear instantly. I would say our results are actually consistent with what others are reporting at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Just a couple of tax things. How much was the R&D tax credit in the quarter? Because I think I missed it. And what tax rate should we be using for the full year? I know you said 16% to 18% this second quarter.
Rajat Bahri: Yes, for the rest of the quarter, used -- for the rest of the year is I used 16% to 18%. And we got a full benefit of last year in our Q1 tax rate because of the legislation was retroactive to January of last year. So in other words, roughly 4 points of benefit -- 4 to 5 points of benefit because of that in the Q1 tax rate, which will not repeat itself in Q2.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: But in Q1, it would've been 14% to 15% without it.
Rajat Bahri: Yes.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Then just a clarification. You talked about the mining business, I understand the peripheral. But how big a business is Australia and South Africa for you, and how much is at stake at this point?
Steven W. Berglund: We don't disclose by country, but kind of net change to our original guidance to what we actually produce, the effect Australia and South Africa accounted for clearly a portion of the mix.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: So it's a good portion of mix, okay.
Steven W. Berglund: And I'm not describing it as a majority, but it was a significant element in the mix.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And you factored that your guidance for the rest of the year assumes that, that stays relatively stable, I assume, pretty much at this point?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And the question I -- the ag business, I understand the domestic side, I know we don't worry about that. How big a business -- as it seem quite -- how big a business is Brazil for ag at this point? Could that business should just take off like crazy? I mean Brazil's ag is very, very strong.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, and the fact is when I talk about -- when I say that ag outside of North America grew at over 30%, there are really -- you look at kind of 3 places. It's the old standbys of Australia and Brazil and then Europe is becoming a significant factor there as well. So ag did grow in Australia. It did grow in Brazil and it did grow in Europe.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And the portion that's not -- non-North American ag would be 1/4 of the business or something like that? That would...
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Again, we kind of talk about segments, we don't talk about any individual revenue by geography. And let's just say it's a -- the international has become a very significant portion of agriculture.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, okay. Because I mean the strength should be quite good and U.S. should catch up. There's no reason why [indiscernible] in that business. And in Mobile Solutions, I guess the acquisitions are driving most of it. Do you have any idea -- you said some idea what the underlying organic growth in that business and we're going to anniversary the acquisition shortly. I just wonder if that what we should be expecting for the rest of the year there.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I mean I think, again, we're -- telling it segment level and not necessarily providing guidance by segment either. I think, yes, the 41% year-to-year growth was, obviously, a lot of that was acquisition. But organically, these businesses are growing nicely. And so I would say even as we lap the acquisitions, we should still see some significant growth going into kind of the anniversary events.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: You said, yes, we should be able to do double-digit in that business?
Steven W. Berglund: I said -- I think I used the word significant. So we'll articulate more when we get to those anniversary dates.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.
Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Steve, could you talk more about this sequester overhang in the second half? Is it really concerns on negative headlines that would affect sentiment or was it more the actual planned sequestration cuts that could play out and have an impact on customers?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think there is a primary and a -- yes, there's a primary effect and then there's a secondary effect. The primary effect is comparatively easy to see. The secondary effect, when it comes to both survey and GIS, is harder to determine whether it's sequester or whether it's just simply a lack of local funding or some interplay between the 2. So I think that our relative forecast, in the second half, we think is conservative and is -- assumes that the sequester effects continue to remain. So I think that in -- so I think there's 1 scenario the sequester seems to start to paint, and there seems -- if it -- the sequester affects -- or at least the uncertainty related to the sequester effects are -- anticipated by the end of the second quarter, I think the first -- the second half takes on 1 characteristic. If the uncertainty discontinues into the second half, it takes on a different set of characteristics. So right now, we believe that second half of the year essentially is the conservative sequester lingers into the second half of the year. There are a number of U.S. federal agencies that are saying we're simply shutdown in terms of new buying until -- through June. We'll talk to you again in July. Now, that would seem to indicate that there's been, let's just call it an initial reaction, which is simply figuring it out but doing nothing while they figure it out. So sequester doesn't mean that the funding has evaporated, but there seems to be a relative state of paralysis, in many cases, in terms of how to deal with it. So I think the uncertainty -- even if the sequester remains, I think there will be a decline in uncertainty. People will start, in the government, will start to figure out how to do business under sequester. I don't know that they've done that yet. And so I think there will be a decline in uncertainty, which will improve the situation somewhat as a level of uncertainty starts to return to the marketplace even in a diminished state. If the sequester is refunded, okay, that kind of leads into a different realm. But I think what we're basically assuming is if the sequester remains, that there will be greater less uncertainty as people actually figure out how to operate within sequester with the diminished funding levels. But there will be some funding available again at a diminished level.
Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: The certainty of known cuts would be a positive. Okay..
Steven W. Berglund: Yes.
Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And for my follow-up on gross margins, had a bit of an uptick in this quarter. How should we think of gross margins in the near term? Is it largely mix driving that or is it more licensing and software or emerging market mix?
Rajat Bahri: Yes, I think as I said, gross margin should continue to inch up every year as our software businesses and our subscription businesses, which tend to have high gross margin, are becoming a bigger part of our portfolio. So we do expect that phenomenon to play out throughout the year. Our gross margin should be higher versus last year.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: I just had a quick one on your visibility and growing subscription revenue. I know you guys are a low backlog business, but I was just wondering if you could talk about how visibility's changed for you and also whether the growing TMS segment gives you a little bit more insight into kind of what's coming down the pipeline?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I suppose in a whimsical fashion, I could say is, I guess, the first quarter proved that we have not yet become a high-visibility company in terms of what's coming at us. So, yes. So I think there's certainly our -- with close to $200 million of deferred revenue in the balance sheet, that element is becoming much more predictable. But statistically, we're still very much a book-and-burn business. And so I think call -- I think it would be too early for me to declare us to become a more predictable company in that regard, yes. Things like Mobile Solutions, even E&C, are becoming more of a backlog business for as we engage more and more with the -- at the enterprise level with large customers, we're getting -- we're changing what's called the tempo of -- or I suppose, the tempo of how we're doing business. So we, in some senses, we're getting better at visibility as we get into more and more key accounts into the mix. But there is still a very large portion of the business. The majority of the business is still basically hundreds of thousands of transactions, worth of hundreds of thousands of practitioners or companies. And so there's still a volatile element here. So I think it's too early to declare us as becoming a more of a backlog with predictability sort of business. It is moving in that direction, but it's still a -- we're still fundamentally a book-and-burn business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: A quick 1 on Advanced Devices. You noted it was unusually strong in the first quarter. How should we think about that for the balance of the year? I know you don't want to give segment guidance, but should we kind of continue to think about it sort of flattish relative to last year outside of that strong first quarter?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, I think that's probably the safest way to view Advanced Devices. It will have its moments. It's the remnants of what is the kind of the true OEM portion of the business. And so it will have spikes, it will have its quarters, we just had 1 of those. But I think overall, it is a relatively quiet, profit-producing, cash-producing business and unlikely to take on, let's call it secular growth characteristics. So I would say kind of viewing it as part of the background as a relatively flattish, steady-ish growth business, is probably the right way to view it.
Operator: And at this time, you have no further questions. I'll turn it back over to you for any closing remarks.
Steven W. Berglund: No closing remarks other than to say talk to you next quarter, hopefully, a better quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Thea and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Willa McManmon. Ma’am, you may begin.
Willa McManmon: Good afternoon. This afternoon we will refer to non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to GAAP measures in our earnings press release and web tables, which can be found on our website at www.trimble.com. We’ll also make forward-looking statements including our expectations for the first quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. The periodic reports that we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the Company’s Form 10-K and 10-Qs discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking comments. A replay of this call is available by phone and on our website. Dial-in information is contained in our earnings press release. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Overall fourth quarter results were healthy and were achieved in – and included an improving picture in residential and commercial production in the U.S. and continued macro uncertainties in both Europe and the U.S. The quarter concludes a year of strong performance. Revenue growth for total 2012 was 24%, which consisted of organic growth at 15% measured with constant exchange rates and 9% attributable to the combination of acquisitions and exchange rate effects. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 36% and non-GAAP operating margins expanded from 17.8% to 19.5%, which represents the best fiscal year performance ever for Trimble. These 2012 results should provide a basic template for accessing 2013. Our overall competitive product and marketing positioning is, if anything, better than it was a year ago since the acquisitions and product extensions over the 24 months have expanded our addressable market and provide greater scope for action. The competitive environment remains largely unchanged and presents no immediate challenges. We currently anticipate continued double-digit organic growth in 2013 with an acquisition kicker of approximately 5%, which gives us an aggregate growth projection of 15% or more. The current environment makes it impractical to be particularly precise in projecting organic growth. This lack of precision results from a combination of factors that provide both potential upside and downside adjustments to the 2012 template. Our outlook assumes modest improvements in the U.S. residential and commercial construction markets relative to 2012. If the current accelerates towards what we regard as the long-term normalized rate, this will represent an upside to our expectations. We are assuming Europe will continue to limp along in its current state and we therefore remain cautious about what the continent can deliver. If it reverts to crisis, this would have a downside impact on expectations. On the other hand, if confidence grows during the year that European leadership is adequately addressing the challenges, the investment climate could become more bullish and our outlook could improve. The most likely meaningful immediate sources of upside would be the Nordic countries, Germany, the U.K. and Netherlands. We anticipate that rest of the world beyond Europe and the U.S. will continue to provide a strong platform for ongoing growth. There are no obvious scenarios that are likely to jeopardize this outlook. The largest swing issue is currently the U.S. During the fourth quarter we encountered some deferrals of planned investment as companies and agencies postponed investment decisions while waiting for improved clarity on tax policy, funding levels and a general resolution of the budgetary impasse. We do not believe this effort is indicative of core underlying demand, but more of a relatively short-term response to uncertainty. It does remain unclear how far into 2013 this effect might extend. We anticipated the effect in our fourth quarter guidance and believe our first quarter guidance also reflects an appropriately conservatively view on the uncertainty. Improved clarity in the first half of the year with an increase in confidence could enhance our growth rate for the year. E&C segment revenue grew 20% in 2012 with expanded operating margins as a result both a strong heavy civil performance and acquisition effects. Software revenue trends in the sector were also positive, which reflects both the improving state of the market as well as strategic execution. Survey instruments represent the most significant current question mark in the segment, both due to the European slowdown and deferrals of purchase decisions in the U.S. Surveyors tend to be sensitive to headline effects and have a propensity to postpone investments when uncertainty increases. This was a factor in the fourth quarter and may continue into 2013. Uncertainties aside, E&C is fundamentally well positioned for 2013. Market adoption in the heavy civil applications continues to intensify and the SITECH channel is becoming increasingly effective as a mechanism for penetrating that market. In the building and construction realm we have reorganized the capabilities we developed or acquired in the last several years to provide better organizational focus on specific market segments and are creating a specialized channel similar to SITECH. In addition, we have launched a project to integrate our various software capabilities around a common platform, which will place our concept of the constructible model at the center of the design-build-operate continuum. Although the project is multi-year, we expect first releases in 2013. Field Solutions segment revenue grew 16% in 2012, while retaining its strong operating margins. Agriculture represents the majority of the segment and remained strong throughout the year as we continued to rollout the Connected Farm strategy. GIS was relatively flat for the year and our new electrical utility vertical provided significant percentage growth partly through acquisition. Again, uncertainties aside, the segment is well positioned for 2013. Agriculture has remaining significant penetration possibilities in the core guidance market, but also has significant adjacencies available in providing solutions for new crop types and extending the solutions set for the Connected Farm with new product categories. The primary opportunity for the remaining businesses in the segment, such as GIS, is the focus on new emerging vertical businesses. While these new verticals will generate relatively small revenues in 2013, they are setting the stage for substantial future growth. Mobile Solutions revenue was up 59% for the total year and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 9.9%. While year-to-year comparisons are difficult due to acquisitions and the related accounting effects, the underlying trend-line for the segment remains positive, particularly in the transportation and the logistics market. With the recent acquisitions of TMW and ALK we now have a unique and comprehensive solution for truckers which we can leverage. The segment also has a number of emerging verticals that have the ability to add to results in 2013, with more to come later. Advanced Devices, which tends to be a steady state segment for us, grew 34% in the fourth quarter and contributed 15% revenue growth for the year with comparatively strong operating margins. This relatively uncommon phenomenon resulted from particularly strong demand for our timing and defense modules. We regard this as a short-term and not the beginning of a trend. Overall we remain confident in the basics of the Trimble franchise and how they will map on to whatever the environment throws our way in 2013. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Raj Bahri: Today I’ll discuss the non-GAAP numbers. The GAAP numbers as well as reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP are detailed in our earnings press release. Fourth quarter 2012 revenue of $515.5 million was up 18% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating income of $85.1 million was up 24% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.5% of revenue as compared to 15.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Margin expansion was driven by operating leverage and higher software mix partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and costs associated with Trimble Dimensions, our biannual users conference. Non-GAAP net income of $73.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 was up 8% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 were $0.57 as compared to diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 in the fourth quarter of 2011. The fourth quarter tax rate was 16% versus 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher year-over-year tax rate reflects the absence of R&D tax credit in the quarter, as well as the geographic mix of profits partially offset by a true-up of deferred tax accounts. Fiscal 2012 revenue of $2 billion was up 24% as compared to fiscal 2011. The organic growth rate excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisition was 15%. Fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating income of $397.3 million was up 36% as compared to fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5% of revenue as compared to 17.8% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Improvement in non-GAAP operating margin were due to leverage on higher revenue and product mix from the software. Non-GAAP net income of $339.6 million for fiscal 2012 was up 25% as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.65 as compared to diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.15 in fiscal 2011. The tax rate for the full year was 17% versus 11% in the prior year. The higher tax rate reflects the absence of R&D tax credits in 2012 as well as the geographical mix of profit. Because international profits are taxed at a lower rate than those in the U.S. a slower Europe has moved the mix of profit more to the U.S and hence increased our tax rate. Assuming the current mix we expect our ongoing tax rate to be in the 17% to 18% range. Turning now to segments. Fourth quarter 2012 E&C revenue was $269.1 million, up 13% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth in the E&C revenue came primarily from sales of heavy and highway and building construction solutions as well as acquisitions. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $42.4 million or 15.8% of revenue as compared to $29.4 million or 16.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin was down primarily due to operating expenses associated with Trimble Dimensions. Fiscal 2012 E&C revenue was $1.1 billion, up 20% as compared to fiscal 2011. Growth in E&C revenue came from revenue growth across all major product categories as well as contributions from acquisitions. Fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating income of $219.1 million or 20.1% of revenue as compared to $159.2 million or 17.6% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin increased primarily due to leverage on higher revenue and product mix. Fourth quarter 2012 Field Solutions revenue was $108.1 million, up 13% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 due primarily to increased sales of agricultural products. Non-GAAP operating income was $37.9 million, or 35.1% of revenue as compared to $34.7 million or 36.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin was down primarily due to product mix in our GIS sales. Fiscal 2012 Field Solutions revenue was $482 million, up 16% as compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to increased sales of agriculture products. Fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating income was $184.9 million or 38.4% of revenue as compared to $162.4 million or 39.3% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP operating margins were down primarily due to product mix in our GIS sales. Fourth quarter 2012 Mobile Solutions revenue was $104.5 million, up 38% as compared to fourth quarter of 2011 due primarily to higher subscription revenue and the impact of acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income was $11.7 million or 11.2% of revenue as compared to $6.4 million or 8.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due to leverage from increased revenue and product mix. Fiscal 2012 Mobile Solutions revenue was $348.1 million, up 59% of revenue as compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to higher subscription revenue. Fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating income was $34.6 million, or 9.9% of revenue as compared to $7.4 million or 3.4% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin improved due to leverage on increased subscription revenue. Fourth quarter 2012 Advanced Devices revenue was $33.8 million up 34% as compared to fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to stronger sales of embedded devices and timing devices. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $7 million or 20.7% of revenue as compared to $4.1 million or 16.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due to leverage on higher revenue and product mix. Fiscal 2012 Advanced Devices revenue was $120.6 million, up 15% as compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to increased sales of timing devices. Fiscal 2012 non-GAAP operating income was $21.6 million or 17.9% of revenue as compared to $16.5 million or 15.6% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin improved due to leverage from increased revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2012 55% of revenue came from North America, 22% from Europe, 16% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from rest of the world. The year-over-year growth rate by region was 25% in North America, 12% in Asia-Pacific, 12% in Europe and 9% in rest of the world. In 2012 54% of revenue came from North America, 22% from Europe, 15% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from rest of the world. The year-over-year growth rate by region was 31% North America, 27% in Asia, 14% in Europe and 9% in the rest of the world. Non-GAAP operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $191.8 million or 37.2% of revenue down from 37.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter 2012 non-GAAP non-operating income was $1.9 million, down as compared to $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to higher interest expense. Non-GAAP operating expense for 2012 was $713.6 million or 35% of revenue down from 35.3% of revenue in 2011. 2012 non-GAAP operating income was $11.3 million up as compared to $9.4 million in 2011 primarily due to better profitability from joint ventures partially offset by higher interest expense. We finished the fourth quarter of 2012 with $157.2 million in cash compared to $154.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our debt level was $911.2 million on a multiple of 2.1 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operations was $96.8 million versus $79.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Accounts receivables for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $323.5 million as compared to $275.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Days sales outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 57 days as compared to 58 days in the third quarter of 2012 and 58 days in the year-ago quarter. Inventory in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $240.5 million compared to $234.3 million in the third quarter of 2012. Moving on to guidance. In the first quarter of 2013 Trimble expects revenue between $575 million and $580 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.43 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.74 to $0.76. Non-GAAP guidance excludes amortization of intangibles of $38.2 million related to previous acquisitions, anticipated acquisition cost of $2 million and anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $9.2 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 14% to 16% tax rate and 130 million shares outstanding. Thank you. And now we’ll take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Thanks, good afternoon gentlemen. Steve, was just hoping you could give a little more color on the U.S., more particularly the housing recovery and it sounds like you’re seeing a little bit of benefit from that, but if you could put a little more color on that? And then if you’re seeing at this early stage in the first quarter any change at all related to kind of the budget issues out there? Or do you think it’s going to be kind of a similar environment to what you saw in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Steve Berglund: Yeah, first of all, relative to the housing – and I would say housing and commercial, the commercial tends to be a bit more regional, but I think the two go a little bit hand in hand here. So during 2012 we were – talked about residential and commercial pretty much through the year of 2012. And early on in the year we were talking about anecdotes, people were talking about the possibility of projects occurring. I think in the second half of the year, particularly later in the second half of the year, we started to see these – the talk of projects actually get converted into projects. So I think that it’s definitely on the upswing. I would say that against historical standards and the historical standards of anything prior to 2008 it’s still pretty anemic relative to those standards, but there is improvement. So I think that in general what we’re expecting is then an improving environment during the course of the year. But I think it’s still early enough; it’s hard to really understand how strong, how pervasive it might be and I think it’s still being held hostage to kind of macro events as well. So still early days, but I think we’re now willing to talk about an actual improvement year-to-year, whereas up until late in the year it was all very kind of latent. As far as the budgetary effects, I think that it was definitely an effect in the fourth quarter. We saw in some cases relatively active postponement, citing the budget uncertainty, from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We had anticipated a lot of that; the early signs were there and it actually turned up to be relatively operative. So for the first week – for the first month of the quarter through January it’s still I think – there’s still a great deal of uncertainty out there. How actionable is still not clear. Typically construction in the first quarter, which is the market most affected by this, really is a March event more so than a January, February event as contractors get closer to being in season; that’s when the real kickoff starts. So I think that it’s still too early in the quarter to be overly precise, but I think the issues are still there: talk about sequestering funds; the big question of debt ceilings and all the rest of it is simply being kicked down the road. So I think it’s still there and we’ll see how operative it is. So afraid I can’t be a whole lot more precise at this point in time. I think we’re really looking for deeper into February and into March for kind of clear signals. But again we think the guidance we’ve given for the first quarter has the effect built into it. So I would say that we’re being, shall we say, appropriately conservative relative to what we’re saying about the first quarter financially.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Great. That’s helpful. And then in your prepared remarks, Steve, you talked again about survey being the weakest area within E&C. Can you talk about what is strong and offsetting it, since that segment overall seems to be performing, you know, reasonably in line with your expectations?
Steve Berglund: Right. Well, I think the strong segment, as it was throughout 2012, is really the heavy civil, the machine control aspects of construction. A strong 2012; we would expect it to be strong in 2013. In part because the SITECH effect is becoming more real; we’re getting I think more mature presence in the market; we are getting a stronger presence in the market and I think that effect is being felt. I would say at this point in time is what we’re calling building and construction, the construction of – the vertical construction of buildings is showing signs early – what I’d call early signs of strength. So particular with software elements of that; we’re seeing software license activity in a number of the businesses showing strong year-to-year growth, which is I think both a statement about the fact that there is some confidence returning to that marketplace and contractors are – contractors and owners are starting to feel like they can make prospective investments. And I think it’s also a matter of okay, as we build out the product line – some of this was just strategic execution on our part. So I would say is heavy civil, machine control, machine oriented aspects of it are still the central point of strength, but we’re seeing the building construction element start to show more signs of life and we’re expecting that will continue into 2013. We wait and see what happens in – on the survey instrument side, but generally our outlook there is positive; it’s just a question of how much this uncertainty – how long this period of uncertainty may last into 2013.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: That’s helpful. And for Raj quick one on tax rate I thought you said earlier in your prepared remarks 17% to 18% going forward because I think of the strengthening euro but then you guided for 14% to 16% in the first quarter. What’s going on with the tax rate?
Raj Bahri: I think Q1 will have a catch-up for the R&D credit, the legislation was passed in January, and it’s retroactive to January of 2011, so we have a catch up...
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Oh, I got you.
Raj Bahri: In Q1. But the full year will be around 17%.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: So does that mean we should model actually – so about 17% for the whole year, so a little bit above 17% for the remaining three quarters?
Raj Bahri: Yeah. That would be a conservative guidance. I mean as I mentioned in my script, the international profits, we have a structure where we don’t pay taxes as long as we don’t bring the profits back. And especially Europe, if Europe, the mix continues, you know, how Europe continues to be weak, so as a conservative guidance I think that’s appropriate. Now if Europe does come back, the tax rate becomes better.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Right, okay. And final one for me and I’ll yield the floor here. I’m just – in terms of TMW contribution, are you willing to say how much revenue that contributed in the fourth quarter?
Raj Bahri: You know, we had said that there will be a big revenue hair-cut in – for TMW in Q because of the deferred revenue hair-cut. So we did – said that that would not – that would add some revenue and it added around $15 million, $16 million of revenue. And we said on an EPS basis it’ll be breakeven to slightly dilutive. So that hurt our operating margins. As I mentioned in my script, our margins were dragged down because of acquisitions and Dimensions. We were up – in spite of those two things we were still up year-over-year on margins. But both those things, the Dimensions cost as well as the acquisition was a drag on margin in Q4. And the acquisition impact, the dilution will continue a little bit in Q1 as well, of TMW, and really Q2 we’ll come to a steady state on these acquisitions. So these acquisitions will no longer be a drag in Q2 going forward. In fact, TMW is a very – as we said, you know, it makes – it has a run rate of $100 million of revenue and it has margins around the 25% – north of 25% range. Those really come into play in from Q3 – Q2 onwards. It will be a drag in Q4 – it was a drag in Q4 and it will be a drag in Q1 as well on our margins
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Hey, guys, congratulations on the quarter.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Just relative to your guidance how do you anticipate investments and kind of this – maybe the linearity of those investments going into next year and some of the spending that’s going to support that? Can you just give us a little bit of color around that?
Steve Berglund: Well, I’m not sure I fully comprehend the question, but let me try and you can redirect me as necessary. So I think that when we start to talk about next year – if we start to talk about 2014, frankly, I feel a higher level of security talking about the out quarters and out years more so than just exactly what may be happening in the next three to six months in the U.S. in particular. But I think the – well, the source of the funding is largely commercial decisions; we’re selling ROIs. So I think the appetite for investment overall, short-term considerations aside, is strong. If you look at construction we’re selling productivity and significant productivity into the construction realm. And I think that there is a strong appetite and in fact a growing appetite to invest in technology to capture the ROIs in construction. So I think E&C is overall a positive story relative to both willingness and ability to invest. I think the technology change is probably going to lead to structural changes in construction because those contractors able and willing to invest in technology will get the upper hand competitively over time. So I think it will lead to some structural changes. But I think the willingness and ability to invest on the E&C side is strong. Now there’s a secondary issue here, which is the relative health of state and local spending on things like highways and the like. So there is a government funding issue that is out there, but if anything, that environment somewhat improved to what it was two, three years ago. So I think steady as she goes in that regard. So I think that there are no fundamental limitations relative to ability to invest or willingness to invest in E&C. I think agriculture runs to its own rules, to its own tempo, and I think the – in general, on a worldwide basis the farm economy is strong and farmers have a strong willingness and ability to invest. And then when we get to Mobile, if anything there, I think the implementation of technology. If anything the driving forces there are stronger than anywhere else in the company. Part of this is regulatory. The regulatory regime in the U.S. is toughening and, in fact, trucking companies for example are going to have to invest in technology to comply with the regulatory environment. And then again there’s a very strong ROI here in the Mobile space as well. So I would say is the – willingness and ability to invest is not the longer term constraint. We may see a quarter or two of indecision, but I think playing out over the course of the year it should be very strong.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Got it. And just a quick one for Raj. In terms of the Mobile Solutions business how do you – how would you see the Mobile operating margins trend then throughout the course of 2013?
Raj Bahri: So, you know, as we saw this year we finished almost to a double digit margin – 9.9% – and last year was around 2% to 3%, so we saw significant expansion this year. And we should see an upward trend; as subscription revenue is increasing this margin should trend upwards into 2013. So you should look at a slope upwards throughout the quarter. I don’t want to be precise – give a precise number, but, you know, it should be an upward trend. And we have significant leverage on the subscription revenue, as you saw in 2012.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Got it. And just one last one for me that’s a little bit more strategic. As we think about the technology penetration story, how much do you see of the organic growth being driven by penetration of the core businesses that you had for a while versus the new solutions and the new applications that you’re now selling? Just wanted to get a sense from you whether you’re seeing a transition point there or whether it’s still being led primarily by the legacy solutions?
Steve Berglund:
 : So I would say as the next two, three years from a contribution standpoint, they’re still going to be heavily oriented towards, as you call it, the legacy businesses, which still have enormous amounts of penetration available to them. And then hopefully over the next two, three years some of these emerging businesses will enter into the conversation more and more and will start to be – start to shift the needle in their own right. But I’d say it’s not likely to see any real rocket ships; that’s just not the nature of these businesses emerging over the next two, three years. It’ll be steady consistent year-in, year-out performance that ultimately leads to a larger business.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray.
Brett Wong – Piper Jaffray: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Kind of going along that same line. With that shift to software services, looking at 2013 is there a way you can kind of give us a more concrete idea of that contribution there, on a basis points stance or something? Do you think it’s a couple hundred basis points that shift is or...?
Steve Berglund: What, in terms of margin or revenue, or..?
Brett Wong – Piper Jaffray: In revenue.
Steve Berglund: Okay. Well, first of all that’s not – internal for the company, that’s effectively not how we look at it. There’s this breakout that we’ve got into the three current categories which Raj can speak to a little bit. But fundamentally internal to the company we talk in terms of providing solutions to the user and the nature of the solution’s typically a bundle of hardware, software, services. And so, yeah, the software content is increasing, it’s increasing all the time and, okay, there are indicators to that, but in reality software as a discrete item isn’t necessarily what we’re typically selling to the users. It’s more often than not a bundle that ultimately is hardware. There are a number of discrete software businesses, but – I’m hoping Raj can be a little bit more articulate – but frankly, we just don’t look at it as a software – software as being a discrete item. It tends to be okay what industries are we providing solutions to and what’s the nature of – what’s occurring in those industries? Not so much ‘how much software are we selling at any point in time?’ Raj do you have some perspective?
Raj Bahri: Sure. So I can give you some perspective. We started breaking down our revenue in three different categories. The product category includes the hardware and the software licenses that we sell, so it does include a combination of both. And then we have service revenue, which is a recurring stream, which is primarily maintenance on the software licenses we have sold and also warranty and those type of things. And then we have subscription revenue where we charge things on a monthly basis for providing the service. So as a combination of service and subscription revenue in 2012 was $473 million and last year the same was $298 million. So in those two categories which carry with it a higher margin there was a 57%, 58% growth rate. Now some of it was acquisition, some of it was organic, but it gives you a direct – and as a result, if you look at the gross margins, we saw a big jump up in our gross margins year-over-year. Our gross margins jumped from 53% to 54.5%, 150 basis points, and that was a reflection of this shift towards higher maintenance revenue related to software and higher subscription revenue.
Brett Wong – Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thanks. Okay well let me ask a more specific question within Field Solutions. So looking at kind of what you’re talking about with a bundled solution. As more devices go into the field and you’re looking at an emphasis on Connected Farm, how should we think about that software-service sales mix?
Steve Berglund: Again, there will be a general trend even in agriculture towards what’s called a more software-rich environment. But then the question gets to be is, okay, if on the tractor the farmer is looking at a screen that is controlling the entire system so that what looks to be a piece of hardware probably has tens of thousands, maybe more, lines of code on it. So is that software or is that hardware? So I think that the software content, the relative value of the software in the solution is going to grow. It’s just okay, where’s the line of demarcation between hardware and software; sometimes it’s relatively hard. Now I think there will be a general trend – not really all that evident yet – there will be a general trend in agriculture just as there will be in construction, again very early days in either of these, but where we’re talking about the constructible model in construction, which is let’s call it a very data rich information intensive environment that will tend to shape all other activity in construction, we would start to see the same thing developing in the agriculture. Where you’ve got a sensor rich environment that’s collecting large amounts of data – maybe stretching the point here a little bit – square yard by square yard. So if you look at the amount of acreage planted worldwide, there gets to be a huge data question in terms of being able to do diagnosis and prescription kind of square yard by square yard, again stretching the case here a little bit. And so there will be a major, strong trend in the industry for agriculture to turn into let’s call it a data and software rich environment to make use of all the data that’s being generated by all these sensors out there collecting things like yield by square yard, so to speak. By the – and then the ability to prescribe a solution kind of square yard by square yard whether it be relative to fertilizer, pesticide, insecticide or even watering solutions. So I think that there are tidal forces that work both in construction and agriculture that leads to a much more – a much richer information and data solution. But then what enables that both in terms of collection and in terms of application is the hardware. So I think again it’s – the two blend into each other, which is why I’m being a little careful about declaring software to be a discrete business in and of itself, because it’s interwoven with the sensors and the hardware capability as well as a complete integral solution. But there are – the trend in both construction and agriculture is going to be towards much richer solutions based on the, let’s call it the big data sort of solutions that are becoming available out there. So I don’t know if that’s on point or not, but maybe about the best I can do for today.
Brett Wong – Piper Jaffray: No, yeah. That’s actually exactly what I was getting at. And just wondering in your view and what you’re seeing, when do you see that transition to that rich data environment for ag and construction?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think we’re being a little bit more open on construction in terms of what we’re doing. So certainly the acquisitions of SketchUp, the acquisition of Plancal, Tekla, when asked have been all aimed at the goal of what we’re calling constructible model, which to us is something different than the conceptual models, the kind of the cat oriens conceptual models that have been around. But a constructible model in our view is a lot more than lines and vectors and angles and that sort of thing, but actually encompasses a much richer information solution. Everything going on to – that’s being installed on the construction site has a history. And so the solution can essentially reach out and capture a history as well as just the current as-designed plan. So I think construction is closer to signs of evidence and, as I said in the script is, in terms of the platform concept we’re working on, is the first releases will be in 2013. So I would hope as a company that we start to provide evidence during the year of 2013 as to really what we believe – putting it on the line a little bit – in terms of new products coming out in 2013. So I think construction is, shall we say, a little bit more imminent. I think agriculture will play out over a longer period of time. But again there are comparative tidal forces at work here that make agriculture in many ways as interesting as construction. But on that one I’ll be a little more vague in terms of exactly when something’s going to happen.
Brett Wong – Piper Jaffray: All right, that’s perfect. Thank you very much for all the color.
Steve Berglund: Thank you, yep.
Operator: The next question will come from Paul Coster with JP Morgan.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Thanks for taking my question. I think most of my questions have been answered. But perhaps, Steve, you can give us some sense of what kind of operating margins you think the business model can now target?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think – well, we’re back to – well, I guess for the fiscal year we were at – on non-GAAP operating margins – we were at a historical high for a fiscal year, of 19.5%. So I would say is that what will drive the margins up over time will be, first of all the software impact. As the software content increases, it will pull greater gross margins. And as long as we’re diligent on managing the costs below the gross margin line, we should be able to leverage that into higher operating margins. And then there’s kind of an overlapping effect, but it’s simply the portfolio effect. So if you look at Mobile Solutions, which is rounding slightly to 10% operating margins, the model should enable us over time to converge on the company average of – current company average of 20%. So there’s a portfolio effect that’s coming out of Mobile. Those would be the two primary effects. But I think – yeah. And so I think – but I think the key thing here – and I think we covered it either the last call or the call before that, is if you take these higher gross margins that we’re generating these days, which are up deeper into the 50%s than they used to be, and if we can return – if we can achieve the leverage to return to R&D, G&A, marketing and selling costs to levels that we’ve had in the past, which are higher at this point in time largely because of the acquisitions we brought in with higher gross margins but also higher costs below the gross margin line. If we can return to levels that we’ve had historically, which would be our overall intent, is, I would say, there – beyond kind of the 20% number that we’re achieving at this point in time – there’s at least two to three points over time that are available to us just through kind of prudent financial management. So I would kind of point at that and say, okay, without necessarily giving a precise timeline on how quickly we get there, but certainly I think the model as we’re operating it has the next two or three points available to us. And then after we’ve achieved that, we can talk about how we do better than that.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Very good. Thank you very much.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James – Dougherty & Company: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Can you unpack the 15% growth guidance a bit, with 10% organic? Maybe starting with where you’re being more cautious today and then where you’re feeling more confident? And then, I guess, are there any segments that are going to fall below the corporate average and then some will be above?
Steve Berglund: Well, I don’t think we want to be overly descriptive on it. I think that the language was selected in terms of, okay, we believe our organic growth for the year will be double – we said two things, effectively. We said that all else being equal that 2012 represents a template for 2013. So if we could take 2012 conditions and apply them on to 2013, the 15% organic growth that we achieved in 2012 would seem to be the, let’s call it the default option under that scenario. We’re also suggesting that there are moving parts. Relative to the macro economy is, on average, the European economy is likely to be worse in 2013 than it was in 2012, simply because it came down during the course of 2012. In fact if the end condition stays constant through 2013 – it’s an if – Europe net-net will probably be worse in 2013 than 2012. At the same time, if we take the U.S., if that stays the same as 2012, we’ve got a lift in terms of the residential and commercial. So there are a number of effects here that are playing out against each other. So I think that just taking 2012 as a template for 2013 would lead you to the arithmetic of 15% organic plus 5% inorganic at 20%, but we’re not suggesting that is the right number. And – but we’re saying – we’re suggesting that it’s 15% plus something, probably, at this point in time. But until we get some better clarity and just in terms of how the year is going to play out, and particularly how the first half of the year is going to play out, I don’t think we want to be overly descriptive about the year either in aggregate or by segment. But as you heard me say is actually we’re comparatively – with the exception of Advanced Devices – we’re comparatively bullish on all three of the other segments relative to competitive positioning, product that we’re bringing to market and kind of the value that we’re selling into those markets. So, in total we’re actually quite bullish about the year. We’re just not sure what the environment will give us as the year goes on. So, we’re being cautious about the macroeconomics. We’re being – we’re actually quite bullish about our own prospects relative to that, whatever that environment is.
Andrea James – Dougherty & Company: That’s actually really helpful, thank you. Just one final one, is 25% incremental margin still the goal for 2013?
Steve Berglund: I think that our state – what we’ve said historically is that 25% is what people should expect from us. Now historically we’ve done better than that, but at the same time I think that we are making a – let’s say, we’re constantly triangulating in terms of how much investment we should be making for the longer term, how much of that gross – incremental gross margin we’re getting we should be reinvesting back into the business in either channel development or product development. And so I think that as a general guide this 25% is a reasonable number to hold us accountable to. At times it may be higher than that, but 25% still is continually raising the corporate average. When the corporate average gets to 25% we’ll need to reconsider what we’re saying. But I think – right now I think that 25% is probably the expectation people should have for us and we’ll see maybe (inaudible) if we have particularly – particular conditions in any quarter, is we may be able to over-deliver on that. But I would say for the year it’s – kind of a 25% number is probably appropriate at this point in time.
Andrea James – Dougherty & Company: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Steve Berglund: Okay.
Operator: The next question will come from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.
Andrew Spinola – Wells Fargo: Thanks. Could you provide a little color on how you’re thinking about capital allocation in 2013 in term of say debt pay down, acquisition, share repurchases?
Steve Berglund: Yeah. So I think that we obviously have levered ourselves up here a bit in the last 18 months. A number of assets have become available and we chose to be a participant as opposed to a spectator to the M&A process. I would say in general – without necessarily making a promise of any sort here – but in general the expectation would be that, okay, we revert a bit more to our historical pattern, so making a reasonable number of acquisitions but generally of a smaller nature. So, general expectation – conditions may change – but general expectation at this point in time would be yeah, we continue to make a number of smaller acquisitions, but funding them out of operating cash flow and with the expectation that there will be cash flow available beyond that needed for acquisitions which will be used to pay down debt. I think that’s the general expectation that should be held. Again circumstances may change, but right at this point in time we’re not saying the acquisition – level of acquisition activity of the last 18 months or so to continue into 2013 or 2014.
Andrew Spinola – Wells Fargo: Got it. And you had – I think you emphasized your credit facility at the end of last year and I was just wondering if there was any signal from that and just generally how you think about your leverage target?
Raj Bahri: So we did upsize the facility because the financing, you know, was much – the refinancing was cheaper and we put more flexibility on the balance sheet just in case. But there is no intent of using it. And then we also extended the facility for another – you know for five years, so it gave us another two years extra. So those were reasons for doing it. It wasn’t to – there was no signal to say that we are acquiring something big. It was for more flexibility, better cost and extension of time.
Andrew Spinola – Wells Fargo: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Good afternoon, everyone.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: I have – most questions have been answered. One question for Raj: on the income statement, the other income number was $9.1 million versus $2.8 million. What was that?
Raj Bahri: Sure. We had a one-time gain. We had a small equity interest in a dealer that we had for a while. We were able to sell it at a big gain, so that showed up in other income. I think it was $6.8 million or so, but we non-GAAP’ed it out. So it’s not in the non-GAAP numbers. It is in our GAAP EPS we have a favorability, but we do not take into account when you look at the non-GAAP numbers.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: You take it out of the non-GAAP number?
Raj Bahri: Yes, absolutely. Since it was one-time in nature, we took it out.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Okay. And the other investment income was the JVs, right?
Raj Bahri: Yes.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Now can you give us some idea what’s going on at the JVs at this point, with particularly the one with Caterpillar, I guess, because they basically have shut down a lot of operations for a while.
Steve Berglund: Well, so probably the – just cataloging the relevant JVs here, there are probably four of them, two with Caterpillar and one with Nikon and one with Hilti. So I think the Caterpillar JVs are first of all the one that was created in 2002 CTCT, which is – whose purpose is to design and build on-board machine control. That, as you could probably guess is doing very well. It established new thresholds in 2012, is generating significant profitability and all in all is a significant...
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: A home run.
Steve Berglund: Yeah. It’s a home run; I hope Caterpillar would say the same. The other joint venture of Caterpillar was formed – and timing was perfect – was formed in October 2008 and is 55% owned by Trimble and really is intended to write software that puts the machine in the context of the construction site and that has – that was intended to have a long runway. It is not, at this point in time, adding significantly to the bottom line, but at the same time is on a very significant upside ramp in terms of number of machines the software is operating on. So I think that strategically after some – after a couple early years of, let’s call it, refining what we were really after there, I think that is on a strong upwards trend at this point in time and is impacting the industry as it was intended to do. So I would say that’s still a strategic play, not yet necessarily, financially, all that additive to Trimble. The other two joint ventures for completeness is, we have a long standing joint venture with Nikon, the camera manufacturer, 50/50 Japanese centered to design what’s called lower-end survey instruments. We absorbed the Nikon survey instruments business at the time into the joint venture. That is actually doing quite well, is quite profitable even on a U.S. standard as opposed to a Japanese standard. And the fourth joint venture of note is the joint venture with Hilti, which is a tools manufacturer headquartered in Liechtenstein, probably could conceivably call the premier tools manufacturer for construction. Again that would fall in to the realm of strategic and really is intended to take advantage of this constructible model concept we’re talking about, and access that model and create a – generations of smart tools, tools that are intelligent, that access the model, access the plan and provide a level of intelligence on the construction site. And that’s – so it’s got a long runway. It’s got a long term development program. We’re still in the early phases of that, but that is really intended to be something of a revolutionary force on the building and construction side. So those are the four joint ventures that have some financial relevancy to our other income line, but that’s more or less the rundown.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: And I don’t have any worries about the ag market for the year, but there is some consternation about what’s going on in the short term, because of droughts and timings and reaction. Are you seeing anything in the first quarter to be – to which we should be conservative on the outlook for the ag market at all?
Steve Berglund: To the extent that we need to be conservative, hopefully we’ve already baked it into the first quarter number. But we’re not overly – we’re not aware of any reason we should be particularly concerned at this point.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Sure. And can you – Raj, can you give us the amount of carry-over of the acquisitions that we have in 2013 versus 2005 in revenues?
Raj Bahri: Steve had mentioned that, we can account at approximately 5 points of growth in 2013 versus 2012 from acquisitions.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: And is that all – most of that in Mobile Solutions or how is it split out among the divisions?
Raj Bahri: I think a lot of it is going to be in Mobile Solutions at this point of time.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Okay, I’ll take the rest offline. Thank you very much.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Raj Bahri: And TMW being the biggest one of acquisitions.
Operator: The next question will come from Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.
Ian Ing – Lazard Capital Markets: Yes, thanks for fitting me in. Just two questions there. First of all infrastructure to support “big data”, you’ve talked about customers connecting and analyzing a lot more information and in your solutions. So does that mean you’re starting to host some cloud and datacenter services and, if so, where are we in that investment process and is it reflected in the incremental op margin guide?
Steve Berglund: Yeah, so actually I mentioned the Caterpillar joint venture from 2008 and as part of that joint venture Trimble took on the responsibility for hosting the solution worldwide. So really the investment that – the bulk of the investment to kind of bulk up to worldwide aspirations took place in 2008, 2009, and anything from this point on is really incremental. So Trimble has created an internal launch team called Trimble Hosting Services in 2008 that – to basically take on the responsibility for this Caterpillar joint venture and as well as all the other activities within Trimble. So I would say is that there’s the dialogue of what’s inside versus the reliance on the cloud, that’s taking place and that will continue. But as far as any step function infrastructure cost necessary to support the activity, we’ve got the facilities in place; we have the staff in place; we’ve got the organization in place; and really have had for now on the order of, I guess approaching four years. So I think we’ve got that well in hand at this point.
Ian Ing – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. That’s a good explanation. And then at Dimensions you highlighted emerging markets; you talked about opening a lot of new offices, a lot of runway there. It looks like in December that Asia-Pac plus other is down a bit sequentially on an absolute basis. Perhaps you could just dive into that a bit? And how does emerging markets play out this year and what are some of the catalysts? I noticed China railways in the headlines and things like that? Thanks.
Raj Bahri: Sure. I mean, if you look at our full year numbers Asia-Pac was up significantly. Asia-Pac was up like 27%; just to trying to dig the numbers here as we talk. Asia-Pac for the full year was up 27% and the rest of the world was up 9%. Now quarter-to-a-quarter there are sometimes swings, one-times that we just sometimes get especially in emerging markets there are contracts that are up for bid. So we may have – last year I know we had a big contract that was up in India that we won. It was not repeatable in Q4 of this year, so India was down this year $3 million or $4 million in one quarter and that impacted the Asia-Pacific number for this quarter. So you will always have a little bit of swings by quarter, but you really need to look at it on a full year basis. And Asia-Pacific was up 27%. And we hardly had any acquisitions in Asia in 2012.
Steve Berglund: So I think, you know, in terms of kind of overall it’s – in talking about the emerging markets as being regional, emerging markets is that, okay, as kind of indicated in the script is that we’re generally pretty bullish about everything outside of the U.S. and outside of Europe. And that would include places like Africa but certainly Brazil and other parts of South America, China. China is doing – back to doing well after a little bit of a hiatus in 2011. India still kind of early days but a strong upward trajectory. So you name a continent – aside from Antarctica – and we’re probably bullish on it as long as the continents are not North America – well, North America excluding Canada and Mexico – and Europe. So I think the regional emerging markets are actually doing quite well and the key issue for us is just executing to the market potential.
Ian Ing – Lazard Capital Markets: So broadly positive on emerging markets, not any particular catalysts for this year?
Steve Berglund: No. No, I don’t think there are – I think fortunately I don’t think there are any particularly unique triggers. I think maybe the one that’s worth mentioning is we tend to have a strong link to China railways, less strong or less dominant than it would have been a couple of years ago. So I think that the railways in China have kind of returned back to a steady state; change in government, kind of the scandals and the issues are behind them. So I think we’re seeing a return to something that we would regard a steady state in China, but that’s probably the only specific factor that would stand out. Otherwise I would say we’re just playing into what’s kind of a mega trend here on infrastructure development in the emerging parts of the world.
Ian Ing – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Raj.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: And your final question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Hey, guys, just one quick follow-up question. What was the organic growth rate during the fourth quarter? I think you gave it for the full year but just wanted to know what it was for the fourth?
Raj Bahri: We will be giving more on the full year basis because it varies from quarter-to-quarter but it was double-digit in Q4 as well.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Great.
Steve Berglund: The issue becomes one of revenue recognition and other kind of accounting considerations, creates some distortions that kind of quarter-by-quarter. So I think that what we’re going to try to point out more is kind of annual trends with some of these – with the volatility taken out of it. So it was double-digits in the fourth quarter, is about as good as we’re going to get at this point.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Steve Berglund: Good. In that case, talk to you next quarter. Thanks for attending.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-01 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Willa McManmon Steven W. Berglund - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary
Analysts: Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Pia, and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quarter 3 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Willa McManmon. Ma'am, you may begin.
Willa McManmon: Good afternoon. This afternoon, we will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in our earnings press release and web tables, which are available on our website at www.trimble.com. We'll also make forward-looking statements, including our expectations for fourth quarter financial results. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. Periodic reports that we file report from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q, discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking comments. A replay of this call is available by phone and on our website. Dial-in information is contained in our earnings press release. With that I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. Third quarter results played out much as we anticipated despite an environment that remains challenged and uncertain. While it is impossible to be categorical about forecasting this environment, our general view is that it may best be described as workable, with great variations in robustness amongst regions and product categories. European demand continues to reflect the general malaise with few expectations of early recovery. On the other hand, U.S. residential and commercial construction seems to be entering the early phases of recovery, although it is too early to determine how robust it may be. Markets in the rest of the world are generally healthy and a basis for some optimism. The other factor that generated significant commentary at the beginning of the quarter was the North American drought and the potential impact it would have on our agricultural sales. In the second quarter call, we described our expectation that any drought effects would be of comparatively short duration without lasting effects on the farm economy and that we did not expect them to affect normal seasonal buying patterns as long as weather patterns return to a more normal pattern later in the year. Actual results in the quarter confirm this view and, in effect, the drought proved to be something of a nonevent despite the commentary. Trimble's quarterly results demonstrated significant progression. While acquisition boosted overall revenue growth, organic growth remained strong and, exchange-adjusted, was in the high teens. Margins also continued to improve and non-GAAP operating margins were above 20% for the third consecutive quarter. We were particularly satisfied with the operating leverage of 37% year-to-year. Although aggregate gross margin is not a definitive metric for us and can be somewhat volatile because of product mix swings, it does provide an indicative measure. It is therefore worth noting that the non-GAAP gross margin of 55.4% represents an historical high for Trimble. This reflects the increasing value of Trimble solutions to the market and our ability and commensurate pricing. This value derives from both the increasing software content in our solutions, which carries typical software gross margins but also reflects the unique value of our bundles, which include hardware, software and services. In these cases, the hardware becomes the platform for software and, in effect, a node in the larger system. Applying a consumer analogy that assumes hardware is inevitably commoditized is overly simplistic in most cases. Engineering and construction growth has been driven by heavy civil products which are demonstrating strong growth as adoption rates of technology accelerate. We also saw a greater contribution from vertical construction, which reflected some increase in North American commercial and residential construction, as well as greater penetration internationally. Survey products struggled in the quarter due in large part to European conditions. We do expect survey demand to revive based on a strong product introduction during October. The Field Solutions segment generated meaningful growth with most of the growth coming from agriculture. Base line GIS revenue was up slightly. The fundamentals in agriculture remain relatively steady. We saw growth in all regions, including North America, which grew in double digits. We also saw a continuation of the trend in which the new information and flow controls products grew at a substantially faster rate than the mainline agricultural products. The Mobile Solutions segment continues to make a major contribution to the year-to-year improvement in Trimble quarterly results. Although the year-to-year profitability improvement continues to be dominated by the PeopleNet acquisition, we are seeing revenue and profitability contributions from the other businesses within the segment as well, most notably in Field Services, which is the remnant of that road. Key to the improvement is the continuing redirection of the portfolio towards vertical markets, which will allow competitive differentiation, a higher value proposition and resulting higher gross margins. The recent TMW acquisition is expected to continue the trend towards a richer financial model once the initial purchase accounting effects dissipate in early 2013. Looking forward, we face something of short-term paradox. Over the last several years, we have built strong strategic franchises that provide significant longer-term growth opportunities. However, the current confused environment makes it difficult to forecast how that potential translates into shorter-term growth. If the worldwide economic conditions do not worsen significantly from the current state, our current perspective is that we can generate double-digit organic revenue growth in 2013. However, we will not be more specific on total year prospects until at least the January call awaiting the results of the U.S. election, the political resolution of the U.S. fiscal cliff scenario and better insight into Europe. Short of a 2008-like collapse, we believe our possibilities for growth in a down economic scenario are better than most. The factors providing this inherent resistance to the downside include portfolio and geographical diversity, which insulate us, to some extent, from singular vulnerabilities. More importantly, we saw productivity in that capacity. This productivity enhancement is becoming central to the success to more larger enterprises, which can not compromise their fundamental competitiveness by significantly cutting back their investment in economic down cycles. Even in a more difficult economic environment, Trimble's focus will remain on aggressively penetrating these markets. Overall, we are facing significant macroeconomic and political uncertainty that may remain with us for some time. Despite this ambiguity, we believe we retain the capability to succeed whatever the environment. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri: Today, I will cover only the non-GAAP numbers. The GAAP numbers are detailed in our earnings press release. Trimble had third quarter revenue of $504.8 million, up 21% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, the organic growth was in the high teens. Third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating income of $105.3 million was up 44% as compared to the third quarter 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.9% of revenue as compared to 17.5% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011. This represents an operating leverage of 37%, driven by higher gross margins as well as operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP net income of $86.8 million for the third quarter of 2012 was up 32% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter 2012 was $0.68 as compared to the diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52 in the third quarter of 2011. The tax rate was 19% for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to 9% in the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the geographical mix of the pretax revenue and no federal R&D tax credit. Third quarter 2012 E&C revenue was $287.2 million, up 19% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Growth in E&C came primarily from sales of heavy and highway and vertical construction products and acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Geographically, there was growth across all major regions. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $71.1 million or 24.8% of revenue as compared to $45.2 million or 18.8% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011. The improvement in operating income was due to higher gross margin as a result of product mix and improved operating expense leverage. Third quarter 2012 Field Solutions revenue was $103 million, up 13% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to increased sales of agricultural products. Non-GAAP operating income in Field Solutions was $36.6 million or 35.6% of revenue as compared to $31.6 million or 34.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to improvements in agricultural product margins. Third quarter 2012, Mobile Solutions revenue was $83.8 million, up 44% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, due to higher subscription revenue and the impact of acquisition. Non-GAAP operating income and Mobile Solutions was $8.9 million or 10.6% of revenue as compared to $3.2 million or 5.5% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margins was due primarily to growth in subscription revenue and the impact of acquisition. Third quarter 2012 Advanced Devices revenue was $30.7 million, up 13% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to strong sales of timing devices. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $6.2 million or 20.3% of revenue as compared to $4.6 million or 17% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due to product mix. In the third quarter of 2012, 52% of revenue came from North America, 22% from Europe, 16% from Asia-Pacific and 10% from rest of the world. The year-over-year growth rate by region was 23% in North America, 32% in Asia-Pacific, 12% in Europe, the rest of the world was up 15%. Growth in Europe was helped due to acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating expense for the third quarter of 2012 was $174.4 million or 34.6% of revenue, down from 36.1% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011 due primarily to better operating leverage and higher revenue. Third quarter 2012 non-GAAP non-operating expense was $3 million, up as compared to a loss of $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, primarily because of a more favorable impact from foreign exchange transactions and better profitability from the joint ventures, partially offset by higher interest expense. We finished the third quarter 2012 with $141.8 million in cash compared to $121.9 million in the second quarter of 2012. Our debt level was $643.1 million on a multiple of 1.5x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Cash flow from operations was $88.8 million versus $51.1 million in the third quarter of last year. Accounts receivable for the third quarter of 2012 was $320.9 million as compared to $317.3 million in the second quarter of 2012. Days sales outstanding in the third quarter of 2012 was 58 days as compared to 56 days in the second quarter of 2012 and 63 days in the year-ago quarter. Inventory in the third quarter of 2012 was 204 -- $234.3 million compared to $227.9 million in the second quarter of 2012. Moving to guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we expect revenue between $503 million and $508 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.26 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.56. The non-GAAP EPS excludes amortization of intangibles of $31.6 million, anticipated acquisition cost of $8 million, and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $8.1 million. We assume the tax rate will be between 15% and 17%, and there will be approximately 129.8 million shares outstanding. Please note that this guidance also includes the impact of the TMW Systems acquisition, which is expected to be slightly dilutive to Trimble's fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.03 per share due to impact of a onetime noncash write-down on a portion of TMW Systems' deferred revenue. Trimble expects the acquisition to be accretive to its 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.12 to $0.14 per share. As mentioned at the time of the acquisition, we funded the TMW Systems through our existing credit facility. We expect the debt at the end of fourth quarter to be approximately $950 million. Which translates to approximately 2.2x trailing EBITDA. With that, we will take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to get a sense from you in terms of what you're seeing out there in the macro environment maybe on a relative basis. Are things getting worse right now from your perspective or have they stayed relatively flat in comparison with the prior quarter? And just any sense around sequestration and the potential impact there.
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. I think it's, again, hard to be specific and hard to being particularly articulate on the subject because I think there are an awful lot of moving parts. I would, in general, say that Europe, against a standard of 6 months ago or even 3 months ago, I think Europe has probably split a bit in terms of -- outlook is, I think, it's no longer just a southern European phenomenon. I think Germany and the Nordic countries, which have been relatively bouyant throughout are now starting to see, I think, more of a bout of uncertainty than necessarily hard recession. So I think investment decisions are being postponed, being deferred or being reconsidered, waiting for some clarity, clarity in terms of resolution of the euro crisis. So I think net-net I would say that Europe is probably a bit worse off than I would've said 6 or 9 months ago. U.S. I think is still very much frozen by uncertainty as well. I think the election is causing some degree of deferral of decision-making. I think the -- the fiscal cliff I think hangs over a lot of things and I think is affecting the investment environment. But I would say in general, for us, maybe not quite so macro, a little bit more micro. I would say is there are probably -- kind of discounting the possibility of the fiscal cliff and the knockon effects from that, I would say is that the U.S. is probably somewhat better than it would have been 3 or 6 or 9 months ago largely because I think that the early anecdotes of some revival in commercial and residential are now being supported by a little bit more data. And as a result, I think that, that provides some potential upside for us. Now, how robust that will be and how captive that will be to the larger bouts of uncertainty, I can't tell. And I would say the rest of the world is generally positive. I think that we've seen, let's call it, improved stability out of China. I think that China is -- we still regard it as both a short-term and long-term growth market. And I think there has been, let's call it, improved stability in China, and I would say, in general, pretty much every other geography has got a fairly positive story associated with it.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about some weakness in the Survey segment, as well as new product releases. Can you give us a little bit of additional color in terms of what your expectations are there and maybe what the impact was this quarter from the weaker Survey?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think that Survey -- without getting too categorical here since we don't disclose at that level. Survey year-to-year was comparatively flattish. And I would -- and a lot of that came out of Europe. And again it's the sense of uncertainty. People in Europe, and I would also argue in the U.S., are -- if they have a discretionary investment decision to make, they have a higher propensity simply to say, "I'll wait a month, I'll wait a quarter just to see if I can get a little bit more information before making that investment decision." So I think that's what we're encountering there. So I think offsetting that is we announced the new GNSS survey instrument at the Intergeo show early in October. That has been very well-received. So I think that we will bounce back in Survey starting in the fourth quarter. So again, I think it's simply a phenomenon of this uncertainty impacting individual investment decisions in a number of different geographies.
Operator: Next question will come from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: So there's some global strength in mining and I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about that, if you're seeing that in your business or if you're playing a role in some of that?
Steven W. Berglund: Really in mining is -- first of all, in the quarter, we actually booked a comparatively -- booked and recognized revenue for a relatively large mining order. So it did have an incremental effect, a positive effect on us in the quarter. In general, I would say, mining kind of statistically, is a secondary market for us. It pales in comparison to construction. And in reality in terms of mining automation, we have typically used out of the joint venture, that is, typically use Caterpillar distribution to access the mines. So mining really is something of a secondary market for us, at this point in time. Now we also would view mining as an emerging market. So we are investing resources in terms of bringing new solutions to mining. But I would tend to put that in the future category more so than anything that is routinely playing a significant role in our financial results at this point.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: And then jumping over to Trimble Mobile Solutions. Can you talk about the competitive landscape there? There seem to be some emerging players, and I'm not sure if they're going after the high end as you are. So could you just talk about if you're bumping up against other folks?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think it varies according to category. So it is now, with the addition of PeopleNet and certainly TMW, what we would call the transportation and logistics market, what we're referring to T&L, transportation and logistics. Hence, be relatively focused in long-haul trucks. And so Qualcomm has been and remains the primary competitor in that realm. So I would say the competitive dynamics there are not all that dynamic. Now in regional fleets or maybe more focused, more local fleets, there are a number of startups or relatively early-stage companies that have announced solutions. Again, many of them are in what I would tend to refer to as kind of the track and trace or dot on the map sort of functionality, whereas we're quite aggressively attempting to integrate with the enterprise. So yes, towards the lower end of the markets, there's more competition. But in the niches, in the segments that we're targeting, I would say at this point in time, there really has been no net change in our competitive view in the last -- say, in the last year.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: One more quick one. Just about the storm that just hit the East Coast. Can you talk a little bit about whether that could have a material effect on your business, positively, negatively and just sort of how you look at natural disaster and the cleanup?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, generally, we're opposed to natural disasters. I guess this is our official statement. But I could argue this one either way and it's hard to tell what the net effect is. So clearly -- I would say probably for the next weeks, maybe a month, I would say that the effect will generally be negative simply because it's disruptive. It has disrupted our channel, has disrupted in the Northeast a lot of kind of activity that would be leading to revenue here in the next 3 to 4 weeks. So I would say in the short term, it's negative. In the longer term, there's certainly going to be a lot of rebuilding. There's going to be a lot of either insurance-driven or government-driven expenditures. A lot of that will pull demand for us. So I would say next month -- and this is largely supposition on my part. There's not a whole lot of science here. I would say for the next month, probably negative. After that point in time, probably positive. But real hard to say what the net effects will be for this quarter or really for the next 6 months. But probably, I would lean over the next 3 or 6 months as it being a positive effect. But again, not a whole lot of science in that view.
Operator: The next question will come from Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions on kind of the ag, the Field Solutions business, and then kind of a bigger-picture question. So first off, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the OEM partnership landscape in the ag sector, and particularly how sales have progressed with Case New Holland, which had results out this week suggesting they maybe actually picking up some market share, which should be a good sign for you all. And then also whether there are other opportunities to add OEM partners, or is that an exclusive partnership?
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. So I'll be less than clear in terms of commenting specifically on kind of results coming out of the relationship with CNH. I don't feel like I can be that specific. But I would say is, to a fair extent, the fact that we had a relatively bouyant quarter in the third quarter would most likely be indicative of what's going on out of the CNH relationship. So I think the CNH relationship was reset in 2011 and extended and, in some ways, reinforced. But to your second question, that's relevant because out of that, we gained greater contractual access to other OEMs. So I think the one that's been public, been made public, is the alliance with CLAAS, which is an OEM arrangement there, and that is progressing quite well. So the answer is, by implication, yes. Things are going well with CNH. And more specifically, yes, we do have the ability to go out and seek other OEM partners, and CLAAS represents one visible outcome of doing that.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then also on the ag side, can you update us on Connected Farm and the adoption there, whether you're starting to see any material adoption yet? And also just comment on the competitive dynamics at that high-end strata telematics part of that market?
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. So I think, as I said in the scripted dialogue, that we're seeing, in terms of the elements that speak to the Connected Farm, particularly the [Audio Gap] products, those are -- the growth rates we're seeing, albeit from a relatively low dollar base, the growth rates we're seeing there are consistently out-running [ph] the growth rates of the mainline agricultural products, which is I think indicative. I think, from an organizational standpoint, is the Connected Farm aspects and kind of the information realm in agriculture is both strategically becoming more central. And then in terms of engagement with the channel, engagement with the end-user community, it's becoming more and more central. So I would believe that there's quite a bit of momentum that is being created fairly recently over the last 3, 6, 9 months. So it has become more central. Now as far as competition at that realm, without being too flip about that, I think it's a category that's in the process of being defined. And there are -- the market really hasn't formed out. Now obviously, you see that some of the equipment manufacturers making statements. You see some of the seed providers making statements about whatever the vernacular might be at that moment in time about the Connected Farm. But I think that the market is forming out at this point in time. I think there is the perception that there is really a very large market relative to providing advice, information and the like to the farmer. And I think that, over the next few years, the market will form out. But I think it's still early days in terms of who's competitor, who's collaborator. And -- but I think the market is forming out. We believe we would be central in the formation of that new market. But as yet, it's still early days to really be talking about kind of what the competitive mix is.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then one last one, if I might. Just a bigger picture question. I mean one of the challenges in forecasting the company, I think, at this point in the cycle is that while your end markets are somewhat cyclical you've clearly shown that your growth story is more driven by adoption of technology rather than fluctuations in the underlying end markets per se. So with that in mind, can you kind of characterize 2013 for us around this scenario? I mean, let's just assume that the end markets are flat, that agriculture kind of plateaus and construction doesn't really rebound, just kind of keeps bouncing along. I mean, what rate do you view the company as capable of growing at on the top line in kind of a flat environment in the end markets, absent fluctuations in the underlying cycles?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, so as I said in the scripted part of this, is that if we could freeze in time today, today's circumstances. Let's call it a weak Europe, kind of an indifferent U.S. and most other parts of the world bouncing along in reasonably good shape. I would see, given that, is I would see a double-digit organic growth year for us in 2013. Now we will get some acquisition lift from TMW and a couple of others during the course of the year. But I would definitely see 2 digits in the number. Now I think we're being a little shy in trying anything more specific on that simply because, if nothing else, the U.S. election and the resulting resolution of the fiscal cliff stuff, I think, is going to have some knock-on effects into 2013. So we're being a little shy about being terribly specific. But certainly, our internal planning at this point in time, with the assumption of kind of frozen conditions continuing into 2013, certainly reflects a double-digit growth number. So yes. But I would generally agree with the presumption that if the underlying markets are flat, if the underlying equipment markets are flat, we should be able to outperform them significantly. Because the other factor that I think is becoming more and more real, it grew during 2012 and I think will continue into 2013 quite persuasively, is that the players, whether they be contractors, construction contractors or whether they be trucking firms or whether they be farmers, I think there is a recognition that technology really is central to their ability to compete. We are seeing examples that we can't talk about. U.S. sugar for example, in agriculture is one we can talk about because there was a press release. They are saying technology is becoming central to their ability to compete. And as a result, is unlike prior periods where it was nice to have and may be early adopter phase sort of thinking, here I think it's becoming viewed as survival. It is becoming viewed as the only way to succeed in difficult markets. So I think from an adoption perspective, I see that the momentum for adoption of the technology is growing at a level that I've never seen in my 13 years at Trimble.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: My first question is on, I guess, a bit of a macro question as well, but you had noted that you would see Europe being weaker now than it was say 3 to 6 months ago. Have you seen that in your order trends? It seems that the revenue of Q2 and Q3 x acquisitions was fairly comparable. But I'd just be curious if you're actually seeing it show up in your results.
Steven W. Berglund: Again, it's spotty. We are seeing it. I'll let Raj speak to the European growth numbers, which -- because -- that were specific product categories. But go ahead.
Rajat Bahri: Sure. So Steve mentioned the specifically Survey business getting softer. So you don't see that in the overall numbers. There are couple of things going on. Tekla is doing very well and that's, Steve talked about the vertical markets doing very well. And that's helping Tekla. The ag business had a fairly decent quarter in Europe. So that's also helping Europe. But what is our biggest business, we could argue, the Survey business, and the E&C business, is soft in Europe. And then we had an acquisition also, a company called Plancal, that is also helping with the European growth rate. So Tekla is doing well. Plancal is doing well. Ag is doing well. But E&C is not doing well.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And SITECH is something that I don't think you've talked much about in this call, I'd just be curious if you feel you're now anniversarying that benefit. Or is it something that you still see as a driver as you look forward?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, the answer probably both at this point in time is that we're kind of in the final throes of building up the SITECHs. They are contributing at both, what I would call, the strategic level and in terms of financial performance. So I think at the strategic level, it is a powerful concept. I think it is helping us in terms of fundamental market positioning. I think it's difficult to competitively counteract the effect of the SITECHs because one channel that's branded commonly around the world that really is hopefully, over time, becomes synonymous with bringing technology into particularly the heavily civil markets out there. So I think strategically, it's not -- kind of building the channel has not been without pain, obviously. But I think we're seeing the benefits strategically. And then from a financial perspective, our continuing comparatively robust results in heavy civil, the heavy and highway type business. The underlying basis for that is what's called a highly capable channel, and we've got that in SITECH. So I would say is, it has contributed and I think that, going forward, we haven't reached steady-state yet. So I think there's still -- as we develop the concept, as we complete the buildout of it and as we become more proficient in the channel, I think there's still additional upside that we can achieve through the SITECHs, so...
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. One last quick question, your Asia Pac number was quite strong in the quarter and then one of your competitors last week pointed out some improvement in the China rail space. I'd just be curious, your thoughts on the China market and how the rail side is beginning to recover. Do you see that?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. As I said before, last year was a difficult year for rail in China. Again we're back to comparatively a steadier state. I think the change in government probably has led to some conservatism in terms of buying patterns in China through the course of 2012. But I would say I don't know if it's back to normal, as defined in a 2010 sense or something, but I think rail is definitely a function again from kind of some of the problems of 2011. So, yes.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Steven W. Berglund: In that case, thank you for attending. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-01 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Willa McManmon - Director, IR Steve Berglund - President & CEO Rajat Bahri - CFO 
Analysts:  Jonathan Ho - William Blair Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray Richard Valera - Needham Paul Coster - JP Morgan Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security Andrea James - Dougherty & Company 
Operator:  Good afternoon my name is Marvin and I will be your conference operator today. (Operator Instructions). I will now hand the call over to our host, Ms. Willa McManmon. Ma'am you may begin.
Willa McManmon:  Thank you for joining us. I am here today with Steve Berglund, our President and CEO and Rajat Bahri, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors including the competitive nature of the market place, the condition of the worldwide economy and other factors detailed in the Company's Form 10-K and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that I will turn the call over to Steve Berglund.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon, second quarter results remained on track despite a more challenging environment. Coming into the quarter we anticipated slower European demand and a non-favorable exchange rate environment. In addition, to the already low level of activity in residential and commercial construction. The change that occurred within the quarter was the intensifying North American drought which had some impact on agricultural sales. Despite these pressures our results remain above the expectations established at the beginning of the year. All acquisitions boasted overall revenue growth, organic growth remained strong and exchange adjusted was in the mid-teens. Margins also continued to improve a non-GAAP operating margins for above 20% for the second consecutive quarter. We currently expect year-to-year revenue growth in the third quarter of around 19%, while the nominal growth rate is lower than the first half rate because of acquisition effects. We generally expect underlying performance to remain consistent with the first half. This expectation is based on two assumptions, one is that the euro centered crisis remains relatively contained to Europe and does not transform into a major macroeconomic contingent scenario. And the others that uncertainty related to the euro and the U.S. election doesn’t freeze investment decision makers into activity as they await greater clarity. Our markets remain workable although the other states robustness are variable across product categories and across regions. Engineering and construction performance is currently being driven by heavy highway products which are demonstration strong growth as adoption rates of technology accelerate. Commercial and residential construction is not a meaningful source of growth although the picture on future prospects seems to be gradually brightening in North America. Survey in other GeoSpatial products from the second quarter did not match the growth of the first quarter although we expect growth will improve in the second half. Our expectations for E&C on the second half assume a similar scenario to the first half with strong, heavy and high demand at generally negative environment in Europe, no meaningful recovery in North American, residential and commercial construction and generally workable conditions in other regions. With this solution segment generated meaningful growth with the contributions from both agriculture and acquisitions. GIS was comparably flat because of revenue recognition of deferrals. Agricultural results held up despite the severe drought conditions in North America. While North America continued to produce credible year-to-year growth, we saw much stronger growth rates in agriculture in South America, Russia and China. While North America is still our most significant region, the strong performance from other regions partially mitigates the exposure to the effects the drought may have on North American demand. Other mitigating effects included diversifying product line. For example, information management products while still generating relatively low revenue grew over 40% year-to-year. Our expectations for the field solution segment in the third quarter are shaped around drought related uncertainty and the affect in farm confidence and aggregate demand. Given the forecast uncertainty we have established an outlook that is quite conservative against historical standards. At the same time we expect other elements of the segment to provide upsize which allow us to maintain an overall positive expectation. We also expect any drought effects to be of comparatively short duration without lasting effects on the farm economy and do not expect them to affect normal seasonal buying patterns as long as weather patterns assume a more normal patter later in the year. The mobile solution segment continues to make a major contribution to the year-to-year improvement in Trimble quarterly results. Although the revenue increase continues to be dominated by the PeopleNet acquisition, we are seeing revenue and profitability contributions from other businesses within the segment as well. Key to the improvement is the redirection of portfolio towards vertical markets which allow competitive differentiation, a higher value proposition and higher gross margins. Our third quarter mobile solutions outlook assumes continued workmanlike progression in the segment, combining revenue growth and significant year-over-year margin expansion. Short of a serious economic dislocation this segment should be more resistant to the effects of any macroeconomic recession scenario because decisions to make commercial plays more productive our long-term investment decisions, they are tend to be made independently of the economic cycle. Looking forward to the next six months, we have no particularly original insight as to what may happen at the macroeconomic level worldwide, we are generally taking a conservative view and are selectively constraining costs. Our planning basically assumes the world remains is current muddling through status for some time with Europe on the sidelines and the U.S. producing relatively and it may grow up. Although we would definitely prefer to operate in a robust worldwide economic, we believe the current scenario still provides us with the potential to put-up meaningful double-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future coupled with margin expansion. While we are exposed to the economic cycle, the nature of our business gives us some ability to resist becoming an automatic victim of a downside economic scenario, at least short of 2008 style cataclysm; this derives from a number of characteristics. Perhaps the most obvious observation relates to the diversity of the portfolio in terms of geography and market served. Trimble has developed in the last five years to the point where it is potentially a mistake to use conditions in any single region or market as a surrogate for the entire company. Our five largest businesses and heavy civil construction building construction, geospatial, agriculture and transportation and logistics are approaching rough parity with each other in size and has historically operated to some extent out of phase with each other in terms of response to the economic cycle. For example in 2009, when construction was a relative disaster, agriculture remained buoyant. Extending our businesses internationally has enabled us to tap more effectively into those economies that are going anywhere in the world. In the current case we believe we can mitigate at least some of the European malaise by aggressive pursuit on stronger markets in South America, Asia, Africa, Russia and the Middle-East. A recent example of our commitment to this address of internationalization is the opening during the quarter of Trimble sales and service office in (inaudible) Ghana in support of the potential significant market in West Africa over the next five years. Another concept supporting a recession resistant hypothesis is that virtually all of our businesses provide productivity solutions not additional capacity, even as economic conditions require our users to keep tight constraints on their equipment capacity we can still solve productivity solutions for the existing equipment population. In fact we believe one of the lessons learned by our users during the last recession and the subsequent slow growth economy is that the application of technology is becoming the difference between success and failure; we are encountering growing evidence that our technology is moving into the mainstream which is likely to drive deeper market penetration and follow-on growth. Although this is true for all of Trimble’s business the clearest evidence is in construction. We have seen recent significant evidence that the center of decision-making for technology is moving from a managers of operating functions within construction contractors to the C level executive. This reflects the recognition of the source of both competitive advantage and profitability in construction. We increasingly be centered on integrated technology. Technology is moving from a good to have to a must have category. Another change that has occurred over the last few years that makes us potentially more resilient is the extension of our soft definition to include more conceptual market scope. Although this market extension has taken place in incremental steps and has not been particularly explicit, it has provided us with significantly more degrees of freedom to exploit under any economic scenario. The central concept across all of our businesses has been to move from a singular focus on task productivity to a more comprehensive view that incorporates our historical strength and providing point solutions into a more comprehensive solution that encompasses this productivity of entire work processes. This provides us with significantly larger addressable market as well great opportunity to sell at higher value bundle at enterprise level. This long term initiative has generally been framed in terms of such as the connected construction site or the connected farm. In developing this concept we have deployed significant capital over the last few years to make a number of software acquisitions including Punch Telematix, Tata, AutoComp, Mobility Telematics, Tekla, PeopleNet, Plancal, SketchUp and WinEst. They have been concentrated in the E&C and mobile solution segments and have extended our ability to provide a complete user solution. Their integration into Trimble has gone well to very well on multiple fronts and as a group their exceeding the financial expectations we held at the point of acquisition. We have had virtually no loss of management or key personnel, the early market responses demonstrating the existence of significance synergies associated with providing more comprehensive capabilities and we are converging at more effective long-term product platforms. These acquisitions enhances our ability to credibly make the key account sale as well as raising the bar competitively. These acquisitions also provide a key to producing additional margin expansion in the next few years. The formulae is relatively straight forward, we have seen 3 to 4 points of gross margin expansion over the last few years largely because of increasing software content that has not yet been fully converted into an equivalent operating margin expansion. Arithmetically this results from our R&D, marketing selling and G&A expenses being at roughly 35% of revenue against 32% 2007 and 2008 which was negatively by the recession in 2009 and 2010. Our current higher relative cost status is resulted from the acquisition process which is generally involved bringing in acquisitions with higher than average gross margins but with a accompanying higher than average expense loads. Well the background of the drawing cost of compliance is meaningful and permanent showing an improvement, over the next few years we have significant scope for leveraging these acquisitions into higher revenue without a corresponding increase and expenses. It will not be a step function process but it is consistent with the success we have historically showed in producing significant cost leverage. Overall the environment is producing significant uncertainties that may remain with us for some time. Despite this ambiguity we believe we retain the capability to succeed whatever the environment. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri:  Good afternoon. I will cover only the non-GAAP numbers in my prepared remarks today. Our GAAP numbers as well as the GAAP turned on GAAP reconciliation available in today’s earnings press release. Today we announced second quarter revenue of $517.6 million up 27% as compared to the second quarter of 2011. For the second quarter of 2012, Trimble’s product revenue which includes hardware, accessories, spare parts and software licenses was $402.2 million or 78% of total revenue. Service revenue which includes software maintenance, technical support and training while $63.6 million or 12% of total revenue and subscription revenue was $51.8 million or 10% of total revenue. Second quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating expenses income was $105.2 million was up 31% as compared to the second quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.3% of revenue as compared to 19.7% of revenue in the second quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP net income of $92.1 million for the second quarter of 2012 was up 23% as compared to the second quarter of 2011. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2012 was $0.72 as compared to diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60 in the second quarter of 2011. The tax rate was 16% in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to 10% in the second quarter of 2011 due to geographical mix of sales and the failure to-date by the Federal Government to reinstate the Federal R&D tax credit for 2012. Second quarter 2012 E&C revenue was $284.2 million up 20% as compared to the second quarter of 2011. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales of machine control and building information management products. Across most geographies partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income was $62.8 million or 22.1% of revenue as compared to 49.4 million or 20.9% of revenue in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement in operating income was due to higher gross margins and operating leverage. Second quarter 2012 field solutions revenue was $123.4 million up 19% as compared to the second quarter of 2011 due primarily to increased sales of agricultural products and acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income was $47.3 million or 38.3% of revenue as compared to $43.1 million or 41.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2011 down primarily due to impact of acquisitions. Second quarter 2012 mobile solution revenue was $81.4 million up 102% as compared to second quarter of 2011 primarily due to PeopleNet acquisition and double digit growth in the base business. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.9 million or 7.2% of revenue as compared to an operating loss of $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due primarily to operating leverage on higher revenue. Second quarter 2012, Advanced Device revenue was $28.6 million, up 9% as compared to second quarter of 2011 primarily due to strong sales of timing devices. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $4.5 million or 15.6% of revenue as compared to $3.3 million or 12.5% revenue in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margins was due to product mix. In the second quarter of 2012 55% of revenue came from North America, 21% from Europe, 17% from Asia-Pacific and 7% from rest of the world. The year-over-year growth rate by region were 40% in North America, 32% in Asia-Pacific, 9% in Europe, the rest of the world was flat. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter 2012 was $176.4 million or 34% of revenue flat as compared to the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter 2012; non-GAAP non-operating income was $3.8 million flat as compared to the second quarter of 2011 because of greater interest expense offset by higher joint venture profitability. Moving on to the balance sheet, we finished the second quarter 2012 with $121.9 million in cash compared to $209.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. Our debt level was $697.4 million on a multiple of 1.9 times trailing 12 months EBITDA compared to $623.1 million on a multiple of 1.8 times trailing 12 months EBITDA in the first quarter of 2012. Accounts receivable for the second quarter 2012 was $317.3 million as compared to $324.7 million in the first of 2012. Day sales outstanding in the second quarter of 2012 was 56 days as compared to 59 days in the first quarter of 2012 and 57 days in the year ago quarter. Inventory in the second quarter of 2012 was $227.9 million compared to $224.7 million in the first quarter of 2012 returned at 3.9 times as compared to 3.8 times in the first quarter of 2012. For the third quarter 2012, Trimble expects revenue between $492 million and $497 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.64. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $31.5 million related to previous acquisitions, anticipated acquisition cost of $4 million and anticipated impact of stock based compensation expense of $8.9 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 15% to 17% tax rate, 128.5 million shares outstanding and interest cost of $4 million. We will now take your questions at this time. Thank you.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair:  Just wanted to start out and get your thoughts around sort of the drought and the potential impact that you guys are looking for or maybe some metrics around how you think this will impact customer buying decisions particularly in the second half of the year.
Steve Berglund:  I think it didn’t have any terribly noticeable effect in the second quarter and in reality it's hard to quantify. Now we have taken a conservative posture in terms of the numbers we have put out for the third quarter. But I think it takes, there are a lot of moving parts here so first of all the center of the country is most affected and their farmers in some cases have already ploughed the crop under and replanted with others style (ph) crop. So they have already moved on to the next cycle. And for some farmers and this season maybe net loss, so what we do see generally is in the September timeframe work associated with the harvesting period we do see an increased demand level and so I think we are waiting and seeing but I don't need there is a whole lot of evidence, I don't think there is a lot of historical experience to drawn on and to actually come up with a clinical observation here but I think that I don't think it's materially affecting the farm economy, I don't think it's materially affecting farmers income and cash flow. So I it may have -- it's likely to have a one quarter if that and then I think we return to the normal buying season and that’s centered around the very early part of the year right before the planning season. So, not dismissing it but at the same time it's not clear that this is necessarily kind of a disaster scenario and then the other thing from Trimble’s perspective we are seeing other geographies moving ahead very strongly in agriculture so I think there is even that the U.S. is affected I think we have got strong mitigation elsewhere in the world.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair: Got it and just in terms of the ag margins, I think you guys said acquisitions kind of impacted the margins. How should we be thinking about those margin trends going forward, is this sort of the new level adjusted for sort of the first half seasonality.
Steve Berglund : Sure, so we bought (inaudible) infrastructure and energy business that we put it in field solutions and that more businesses are low single digit operating margins so it dilutes the margin significantly as we compare it to the last year on a segment basis. Having said that you know for example ag gross margins were not impacted year-over-year at all, we do have some incremental R&D spending going and that may hurt the margins by a point or so but we have said historically that once we reach these level of margins it's hard to retain those margins all the time but there is no competitive threat or no pricing pressures in the marketplace at this point of time which leads to believe that there are some short term issues on margins.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: Could you talk a little bit more about the inorganic versus organic question, I think your estimate was that organic growth revenue growth from the quarter would be in mid-teens how should we look at that going forward?
Steve Berglund :  Sorry what was the question? How is it all going forward? As I said growth? As I said in the script we expect the second half to look much like the first half in terms from an organic growth standpoint.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: How should we think about your long term revenue growth rate though, is that sustainable for the foreseeable future how should we anticipate?
Steve Berglund : We have been on record for years saying overall on the long base line looking forward is 15% to 17% with the idea that typically over time it's 2 to 3 points of that will be related to acquisition, the rest will be organic. So in a sense we are saying our current organic pattern is consistent with what we believe the long term to be.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray: How is Tekla performing in light of the European weakness?
Steve Berglund :  First of all Tekla is not overly tied to Europe we bought in Tekla a worldwide enterprise with significant operations in India, other parts of Asia, the U.S. and alike. So I would say is certainly there is conservatism in the marketplace that may not have existed a year ago in terms of deferred buying decisions but that’s true in the U.S. as well as Europe. So I would say is that Tekla which has a very, very strong basis in maintenance as well which is recurring, I would say is that Tekla is not, is maybe encountering some head winds in Europe but they didn’t exist a year ago but Tekla, Tekla first of all is it is not overly tied to Europe but it is really tied to worldwide economic conditions but Tekla is doing fine. In fact in places like India they are doing extremely well. So I think we still view as Tekla as a double digit growth enterprise, if they are not going gangbusters in Europe they may be going well in other places and then there is a fair opportunity for example using the Trimble infrastructure to bring them into places where they may be under present in such as Brazil. So I think Tekla is still every bit the story that we talked about a year ago.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray :  And how is China performing considering the concern (ph) in that region?
Steve Berglund :  So China tends to be a kind of a bit lumpy at the moment, I think it's not the let’s call it the relatively huge story a few years ago, we still see it as a growth story. The second quarter was probably a little flat wise but that was due to some specific reasons that are likely to pass in the second quarter. So we are still seeing China as very much of a growth story.
Brett Wong - Piper Jaffray:  Okay then and one last one for me, in last year (inaudible) and field solutions in 2013 as the OEM partner.
Steve Berglund : First of all on principal I wouldn’t want to necessarily speculate about any particular OEM but in general I would say its factors likely to be incremental, agriculture is getting the sizeable business so it's taking more and more to actually move the needle on it. So I would not in general want to comment specifically but I would say it would not be appropriate to view it as what’s called a discreet factor that will move the needle in 2013.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Valera with Needham.
Richard Valera - Needham: In the quarter I think you mentioned the question as to whether Europe would have grown organically ex-acquisitions that you are grow in the quarter, could address that one again.
Rajat Bahri : So Europe excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions was I would say slightly down, flattish to slightly down but with acquisitions it reported growth for Europe but on an organic basis it was very slightly down.
Richard Valera - Needham: So just trying to get a sense of the trajectory of the business in Europe quarter-to-quarter and maybe taking out seasonal effects, would you see that at the margin it was very similar business conditions or anymore challenge than it was a quarter ago.
Steve Berglund : I think in the last quarter I think we at least attempted to provide the view that we thought Europe was let’s just say certainly not improving and probably getting a little bit more problematic. I think what is happening in Europe at the moment is that while we have seen for quite some time is the Southern Tier of Europe, Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland have done very weak and have really not been a factors to the upside at all for us. But until fairly recently Germany, the Nordic countries, the Benelux countries have provided relatively strong growth in France is sat in between, I with the headline factor that’s going on in Europe in terms of the uncertainty of the future of the euro, I think the psychological effect has caused relative conservatism on as far as investment decisions. I don’t think that investment decisions may not be getting cancelled but I think they are getting deferred so I think in general over the last three, four, five months because of the kind of headline factor there has been a bit of paralysis in investment decisions in Europe and so I think that for the second quarter as well as for the second half of the year that is basis of our thinking and not necessarily a real collapse of demand but I think a general slowness that relates more to the psychology of it decision-making relative to investment. So I would say yes I think the environment decision-making environment today is more difficult than Europe than it was six months ago.
Richard Valera - Needham: Okay that’s helpful and then with respect to mobile solutions, I know historically when we have had challenging macro-environment, the cathode business have seen pretty significantly increase churn. I know you are actually trying to think I think sort of churn that business somewhat and focus more in verticals but have you seen any evidence of sort of macro-based increase in churn in that road maybe beyond what you had planned?
Steve Berglund : The general answer is no, I mean again we are changing business models here so I think that we are going through a period here for maybe another six months of increased churn simply because we are focusing on the let’s call it the higher value model and I would say the higher value model is much more resistant to churn that what’s call the kind of the mom and pops who thought on that functionality and when the times get tough the consequences of giving that up are relatively low so they have had a tendency to churn. With the higher value solution, we are more tightly integrated into the enterprise model and therefore there is a higher cost to get that up and because it's just producing value. So I would say if anything, if you look to those style of businesses overall for the company I will say we can probably make it an argument, the churn rate is declining not increasing.
Richard Valera - Needham: That’s helpful and one more in mobile solutions if I could, you’re op margin in mobile solution has dropped about 300 basis point sequentially, I know you think you said we should accept some sort of noise in that number, you drew up 10% in the first quarter, we should something of 10% of sort of the anchor point and just think there might be some kind of bouncing around, around that number just wondering any guidance here will be helpful.
Rajat Bahri :  Sure we said six year ago that we will expect double digit operating margins into back half of 2012 and with things incrementally getting better, Q1 was a little bit better, we had a little bit better mix and mix of hardware and software sales impacts margins and so forth. So there is some noise created by that but yes we are still committed to generating a 10% margin in the back half of the year and slowly improving it sequentially but you really have to look things at a 12 month rolling average or a six month because of this noise. But that line should be upwards as we move forward.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JP Morgan.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan:  I would like to ask you a question as this business model has evolved and there is more software and service being folded into it. How is your visibility into future revenues evolving, do you better visibility both short and sort of medium term?
Steve Berglund :  Arguably it's better than it was, that I wouldn’t necessarily call it great at this point in time, and statistically we are still a book and burn business. We do have a bit of -- we do have a larger deferred revenue number on the balance sheet that is predictable but that doesn’t necessarily what’s called kind of a more predictability on the aggregate. So I would say it is still a difficult business to claim strong visibility into and the nature of the business is changing, so larger portion of the business is tied to larger tenders which tend to be either produces zero or one in any given quarter. So I think in some sense any given quarter in isolation is getting somewhat harder to predict simply because there are these large orders that can move into a quarter or out of the quarter. So I think that probably individual quarters are net-net getting harder to predict but I would say visibility into the business, pipeline analysis is probably better than it used to be but it's still just an incremental improvement not significantly, is significantly more predictable environment than we would have two, three years ago.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Okay the other question I had was that, you are a pioneer, you have created this new sort of solutions orientation inside the industry verticals. I am sure others have taken note and emulating, is there competitive landscape changing, you mentioned tenders earlier on, is it price paced competition or is it, is this still a fairly benign competitive landscape globally?
Steve Berglund:  Yes I think if you take a snapshot of today, I think the competitive environment hasn’t radically changed from that which you would have seen three, four years ago. Certainly agriculture is competitive, structure is very much the same as was five to 10 years ago and that has been a very stable competitive environment. Construction it's still fundamentally us and Hexagon and Topcon with let’s call as we get more and more into the bin (ph) world and we get into more and more of the software world and construction, obviously the position from a competitive standpoint or from a structure standpoint will start to shift and there will be new combinations that some of them competitive, some of them collaborative that will emerge and in mobile solutions that’s also reasonably stable at this point in time. So I would say is as of today the competitive makeup looks pretty much the same as it has for some period of time, I would expect that over the next five years it will become more dynamic environment in terms of both competition and collaboration. And on these large tenders, it's always about price, it's a different model which is when you are selling large scale tenders, the pricing will come down but at the same time and gross margin will therefore be somewhat lower, at the same time marketing and selling the costs are also lower. So I think that it doesn’t necessarily change the bottom-line result but there is an element of price competition that doesn’t exist on kind of all the one offs that have been our main stay for a long time.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Security.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security:  Couple of questions, one can you give us how much of the quarter was acquisitions and where they were reported, I assume the good part within you have a little bit left from Tekla on a year-over-year basis and a lot of it was in mobile solutions?
Rajat Bahri :  Yes that’s fair, majority of the acquisitions were in those two segments and what was the other question?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: How much was the contribution from acquisition?
Rajat Bahri :  As Steve said organic was mid-teens, we did 27% growth rate so the acquisitions partially offset by foreign exchange.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: Okay and how much was foreign exchange?
Rajat Bahri :  Probably around 3 points of negative growth.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: 3 points of negative growth and did that effect the bottom-line the same way?
Rajat Bahri : No we are naturally hedged right so we don’t as we said the (inaudible) for the most part we are protected from a bottom-line perspective.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: So really not much impact, now correct if I am wrong, I thought the majority of the ag sales take place in the first half of the year, is it more like 60% - 70% takes place in the first half?
Steve Berglund :  Yes so without necessarily specifying the percentage that’s the right point of emphasis.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: You really should mention with 85% of the crop acres insured probably should have very little impact on the marketplace. Now the growth that you are seeing in E&C business this year were formidable, is that just the beginning, we finally pass SODO (ph) highway bill I mean they got certainty they don’t any more money but it's about the certainty is that what’s really driving the strength in the marketplace, disappointed people are planning now for the next few years?
Steve Berglund : I don’t know that I tied the heavy and highway results necessarily to any specific source, again its international so the U.S. is just one piece of the larger puzzle but it's certainly helpful and actually since you bring up the highway bill it's helpful in another regard for another Trimble business because it also specifies new set of rules and regulations relative to the operation of long haul trucks for example which rather for good or not brings a whole realm of regulation which in turn will tend to accelerate the adoption of our offering in the transportation and logistics realm, the mobile solution realm. So that is actually going to accelerate spending in what we are selling in the mobile solutions realm as well.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: Is this related to the our service act or the compliance…
Steve Berglund : Yes
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: I am sure but is that effective July 2013?
Steve Berglund :  Yes but in terms of driver’s logs and all that’s around that it's going to require for many truckers it's going to require a new investment in technology to keep those among other things, the driver’s logs.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: Now you gave the subscription sales about 10% of sales, is that mostly coming from mobile solution, is there any subscription sales related to the ag market or the field solution business?
Rajat Bahri :  I mean there is but the vast, vast majority is mobile solutions. We do have some subscription sales in E&C that we monitor, the construction site and the charge the subscription model to provide that service, same thing we have a connected form and we provide subscription services but I would say vast majority of it is mobile solutions but there is some an E&C nag.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Security: Is that the same thing true with service or is that put across all the divisions.
Rajat Bahri : The service is primarily software maintenance which is primarily E&C and to some extent field solutions. So sell software licenses and then there significant maintenance stream that comes with selling those software licenses that is capture in the service line.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Andrea James with Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company:  I just had a two questions on ag, can you just provide an update on your expansion into international markets, I know you have been focusing on new crops and I was curious about how it's going and do you like the traction that you are getting? 
Steve Berglund : Yes I think in terms of bringing ag international, probably five years ago we had three foundation markets, it was North America, it was Australia and it was Brazil and we have made conscious efforts overtime to bring the capability into new markets starting with Europe and now places like China as well. So we are getting traction, we are having good success like I indicated that we were getting very strong growth rates in some of these international markets. And then I think that there is a certain realm of overtime of potential of in a sense of becoming more local for example we are getting some traction in Africa but I think the solution in Africa it may end up needing to be different than the solution you would find in the middle of North America. So I think that we will have to do some level of reinvention and conform to local market needs but I think that we are in some cases a little surprised by the take up of the technology and what we thought we are going to be traditional and therefore somewhat more patient markets but we quite pleasantly surprised in some cases of how rapidly the technology is been absorbed but in general I think that right across the board in terms in international activities and ag, we are seeing traction and we are seeing good results.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company: Thanks and then second it looks like, it just seems to me like dealer wants to make a bigger move into the space. I am just curious to get some updates thoughts from you on the competitive landscape in ag.
Steve Berglund : Again without been at all complacent here, I think that in terms of the fundamental structuring of the market, in terms of the fundamental competitive inner play its comparatively stable to what it has been, so again there are initiatives but certainly at the high end of the product range in terms of the autopilot ROM (ph) product, I think (inaudible) for us is probably the prime competitor and the prime challenge but it's been that way for years. I think the competitive next is different for the manual guidance at the lower end. But I don’t think there is any title force that we are currently in a competitive makeup of the market. So I would say what you see is probably what has existed and is likely to continue for some period of time.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company: Thanks and then since I have you, I will lob in one more, can you talk about the integration of SketchUp and are you able to convert some of those many users that is required into paying customers and what does that kind of look like going forward?
Steve Berglund:  Well again I think we are in the process of doing at this point in time, I think that we are eager to again do something’s fairly quickly display new capabilities, demonstrate those capabilities and then maybe to talk about what it means. So, aside from what we said at the point we announced the acquisition from an overall standpoint I preferred to wait a while and then point to actual accomplishment as opposed to prospective aspirations mainly.
Operator: And there seem to be no further questions at this time.
Steve Berglund: In that case thanks for participating on the call and talk to you next quarter.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, my name is Ashley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. McManmon, you may begin your conference.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we begin, let me remind you that any forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent question-and-answer period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Qs or other documents filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission.  During this call, we will refer to a press release. The press release and additional financial statements are posted on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press releases. I will now turn the call over to Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Raj Bahri, our CFO.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. First quarter results continue to reflect momentum and we established both symbolic and meaningful milestones in the quarter. Quarterly revenue was about $500 million for the first time in company history. Non-GAAP operating profits were above $100 million for the first time. Mobile Solutions segment margins were above 10% and most importantly, non-GAAP operating margins have returned to levels above 20%.  Our markets remain workable although none have returned to pre-cash stage of robustness except for agriculture. Commercial and residential construction remains weak, although the picture on future prospects seems to be gradually brightening with the prospect of improvement later in 2012 or in 2013. In addition, Europe remains volatile and uncertain, requiring us to remain conservative in our outlook for the medium term until the continent sorts itself out politically and economically. Moreover, if the European problems are not contained, they have the potential for significant spillover effects worldwide. These conditions aside, our current market outlook remains positive by region and by industry. Our comments in January which anticipated total year revenue growth in the neighborhood of 20% were obviously reinforced by the first quarter results. Our current outlook for the year remains consistent with that earlier view with the bullishness of the first quarter balanced by some Euro-centric conservatism. The first quarter results also reflect the first time Trimble has broken out revenue by product, service and subscription categories. Raj will provide more granularity, but the results reflect service and subscription recurring revenue is more than 20% of total revenue, with gross margins above the company average. While this breakdown does not provide a complete strategic picture since it does not capture software content sold as licenses or as part of a product bundle, it is indicative of the significant changes that have taken place in our product mix over the last 5 years, as we implemented a strategy focused on providing complete solutions, targeted at vertical markets. We once again saw encouraging results in all 3 of our most strategically important segments, E&C, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions. E&C reflected organic growth in both heavy and highway and survey instruments, as well as the effect of acquisitions. These improvements in E&C were delivered in spite of the still dormant commercial and residential construction market, slower sales in China related to the recent problems specific to railway construction and cautious decision-making by users in Europe. The Field Solutions segment again demonstrated year-to-year growth with contributions from agriculture, GIS and acquisitions. Agricultural performance reflected the strength of our product portfolio and the relatively strong agricultural economy around the world. GIS, although constrained by both governmental budgets and slower European sales, also continued to produce growth. The Mobile Solutions segment made a major contribution to the year-to-year improvement in Trimble quarterly results. Although the revenue increase was dominated by the PeopleNet acquisition, the significant year-to-year profitability improvement was a combination of both PeopleNet and improvements in the base business. Key to the improvement is the redirection of the portfolio towards vertical markets which will allow competitive differentiation, a higher value proposition and higher gross margins. This portfolio shift involves consciously refocusing away from subscale subscribers growing a limited dot on the map functionality and towards larger fleets with more demanding requirements. During this crossover period, we have -- we will therefore see a higher level of churn within one class of subscribers with offsetting growth in another class of subscribers. The overall blended segment baseline revenue will therefore camouflage this beneficial trend until 2013, when we will see higher revenue growth as the swapping-out process winds down. What we should see is relatively continuous improvement in profitability as the mix moves towards the more demanding subscribers with corresponding higher gross margins. Although most of our new wins in the segment are not press release-able, 2 recent examples that are not public are Maruti Suzuki in India, which involves managing thousands of trucks and today's announcement of our win at the U.K. Ministry of Defense, which will involve equipping a fleet of at least 12,000 vehicles. These wins are notable because they both included a demanding set of performance expectations that Trimble is well positioned to deliver. In addition, they provide some early validation of our view that it is productive to view this as a global market.  Advanced Devices segment margins remain relatively strong on flat revenue. Our outlook for the year remains modest, although we have a number of long-term growth possibilities based on technologies under development. After a period in which we have made some comparatively large acquisitions, we have reinforced a solid strategic position in our core businesses. Our focus has been on establishing a full set of capabilities that will enable us to provide unique solutions to our users, as well as achieving sufficient scale to sustain global leadership status. Two recent examples illustrate different aspects of this focus. One is the acquisition of Gatewing, which is an early-stage Belgian company that provides small unmanned aerial vehicles that can be used as platforms for photogrammetric sensors. This demonstrates that geospatial sensor technology continues to evolve and provides a basis for new sources of growth. The expectation here is that cost effective airborne sensor platforms can both replace some terrestrial survey applications and more importantly, expand geospatial information solutions into a number of new applications that were previously out of bounds because of practicality or cost. By extending our position in sensor platforms, we are reinforcing our position as a complete and integrated solutions provider, bundling sensor platforms together with software that drives intelligence from net sensor data. Towards the other end of the continuum is the acquisition of SketchUp in Google. Beyond its obvious attraction as an effective tool for millions of architectural, engineering and construction users, it will play a key strategic role across a number of Trimble's core businesses. While we will postpone a detailed description of the strategy until after we have closed the transaction, we see SketchUp as a central platform for providing the grease and glue that will couple field operations with other enterprise activities. Historically, Trimble has been strongest in providing solutions based on field operations. However, we believe that technology now enables a tighter integration of those field operations with decisions being made elsewhere in the enterprise. SketchUp, together with Tekla and a number of other recent acquisitions and internal developments gives us the tools to provide these more complete solutions. Our initial focus will be on providing solutions for the cadastral, heavy civil and building construction markets. Achieving this position has added leverage to our balance sheet. While comfortable with our ability to manage anticipated post-SketchUp levels of debt, we currently expect some amount of deleveraging to take place in the next 12 months. At the same time, we expect there will be a number of smaller acquisitions over that time to ensure we retain our advantage in both capability and scale. Overall, we remain confident in our position and in our ability to execute in current market conditions and optimistic about 2012. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri: Good afternoon. I will cover only the non-GAAP numbers in my prepared remarks today. Our GAAP numbers, as well as GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation are available in today's earnings press release. Today we announced first quarter revenue of $502.3 million, up 31% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Going forward, as Subscription and Software sales become a material part of Trimble's total revenue, we'll break up our revenue by 3 categories, Product, Service and Subscription. For the first quarter 2012, Product revenue, which includes categories such as Hardware, Software Licenses and Accessories, was $398.5 million or 79% of total revenue. Service revenue, which includes categories such as Hardware and Software Maintenance and Support, Training and Professional Services, was $57.4 million or 12% of total revenue. And Subscription revenue, which includes categories such as Subscription Service, was $46.3 million or 9% of total revenue. First quarter non-GAAP gross margins were 54.3% versus 51.9% in the first quarter of 2011. The increase was driven by a mix shift toward software and subscription sales. First quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating income of $101.7 million was up 45% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.3% as compared to 18.2% in the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP net income of $87.3 million for the first quarter of 2012 was up 40% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2012 was $0.68 as compared to diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 in the first quarter of 2011. The tax rate in the first quarter of 2012 was 17% compared to 16% in the first quarter of 2011. The increase was due to the expiration of federal R&D tax credit legislation in 2011. First quarter 2012 E&C revenue was $248.9 million, up 31% as compared to the first quarter 2011. The growth was driven primarily by strong sales of machine control and survey products across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and acquisitions.  Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $42.8 million or 17.2% of revenue as compared to $25.1 million or 13.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2011. The improvement in operating income was due to operating leverage and higher revenue and acquisitions. First quarter 2012 Field Solutions revenue was $147.5 million, up 20% as compared to the first quarter 2011, due primarily to strong sales of agricultural and GIS products and acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income in Field Solutions was $63 million or 42.7% of revenue, as compared to $53 million or 43.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 Mobile Solutions revenue was $78.4 million, up 76% as compared to the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the PeopleNet acquisition. Non-GAAP operating income in Mobile Solutions was $8.2 million or 10.4% of revenue as compared to an operating loss of $338,000 in the first quarter of 2011. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due to PeopleNet acquisition and increased profitability from the base business. First quarter 2012 Advanced Devices revenue was $27.5 million, up 3% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $4 million or 14.4% of revenue as compared to $4.5 million or 16.9% of revenue in the first quarter 2011. In the first quarter 2012, 53% of revenue came from North America, 24% from Europe, 15% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from rest of the world. The year-over-year growth rate by region was 37% in North America, 34% in Asia-Pacific, 22% in Europe and 16% in the rest of the world. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter 2012 was $171.1 million or 34% of revenue, flat as compared to 34% revenue in the first quarter 2011. First quarter 2012 non-GAAP nonoperating income was $2.5 million versus $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2011 due primarily to greater interest expense and impact of foreign exchange transactions, partially offset by higher joint venture profitability. We finished the first quarter 2012 with $209.1 million in cash, compared to $154.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our debt level was $623.1 million on a 1.8x trailing 12-month EBITDA, compared to $564.4 million on a 1.8x trailing 12-month EBITDA in the first quarter of 2011. Our net debt level remained unchanged for the quarter. Our cash flow from operations was $67.7 million for the quarter, compared to cash flow from operations of $28 million in the first quarter of 2011. Based on our current acquisition pipeline we expect our debt level to be in the $725 million to $800 million range in the second quarter of 2012. Accounts receivable for the first quarter 2012 was $324.7 million, as compared to $275.2 million in the fourth quarter 2011. Days sales outstanding in the first quarter 2012 was 59 days, as compared to 58 days in the fourth quarter 2011 and 63 days in the year ago quarter. In reentering the first quarter 2012 was $224.7 million compared to $232.1 million in the first quarter 2011, but down by 3.8x as compared to 3.7x in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our guidance for the second quarter 2012 is for revenue between $510 million and $515 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.43, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 to $0.71. Non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $29.1 million related to previous acquisitions, anticipated acquisition cost of $5 million and anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $8 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of 15% to 17% tax rate, 129 million shares outstanding and interest cost of $4 million. We will now take questions at this time. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A quick question on the distribution channel for your E&C product. Can you give us some sense now, Steve, where you stand in terms of building out the Caterpillar partnership?
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. So you're referring to the SITECHs that we're putting in place. So again, when the dust settles, is that there should be approximately 105 SITECHs in existence around the world, something on that order of magnitude. I would say it -- in all honesty that it has gone more slowly than we anticipated, simply because each one has tended to be a bit of a transaction onto itself, so it has taken time. They're coming in relatively quick succession at this point in time. So I would characterize it at this point in time, more or less is that we have more than 70 in place and basically all the rest are being worked at this point in time. So and I think, and maybe more to the point, if you look at the geographic coverage at this point in time, from a Pareto perspective, we have arrangements in place that cover what I call basically most of the major markets. And so we are starting to see the effects of SITECH, but -- we're in good shape on the SITECHs, it's just going a bit slower than we anticipated just because of the nature to create a special transaction basically each time. So -- but I think that in terms of market coverage, we're getting pretty close to having it complete.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: You said you've introduced the Eurocentric conservatism into the guidance by not raising the full year. What is it you're seeing? Because the numbers look good, and I believe it's up 22% year-on-year in the first quarter. So, so far so good.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So far, so good and I think that the, we're anticipating conditions to continue until the second quarter. I think it's just essentially we have no real visibility that extends much beyond 3 months. I think we're just respecting what's going on in Europe relative to the Dutch government falling a couple weeks ago, what's going on in France and that the relatively fragile coalition around austerity in Europe is getting a little frayed at this point in time. So I think we're just being, on principle, conservative and not simply converting this into a game -- a matter of arithmetic. If you do the arithmetic, yes, it would imply that there is some upside to what we may have said in January, but I think we got to respect the situation in Europe, as all companies operating in Europe should.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, my last question is, you've changed the manner in which you disclose your results by adding in product services and subs. You've also made some acquisitions in software and services recently. And I still though, when I'm talking to investors that are not familiar with the story, think the first barrier to overcome is that they still think of Trimble as a GPS product company, which obviously it isn't anymore. Can you -- what, I know it's kind of a strange forum for it, but what is Trimble now? What will it become?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I think -- it may not fit in any easy category for people like you, Paul. I'm sorry about that, but I think we're fundamentally a -- we would, our self description would be we are an applications company. We're a solutions company. We look for vertical markets that are underserved by technology and we enter those markets with the capabilities we have and we solve problems. So I would call the -- if you will, kind of 5 core franchises, being: Cadastral Surveying, Heavy Civil Construction, Building Construction, Agriculture and now Transportation and Logistics. Beyond that, I would say there are category of roughly 10 or so emerging markets that would include markets like Forestry or Electrical Utilities or Railroads, where we're increasing our vertical market orientation, attempting to do the same thing as we did in Agriculture and Heavy Civil, which when I first came to the company, were more or less nonexistent. So I would describe us as being an applications company that is comparatively agnostic when it comes to technology. Yes, GPS or GNSS is still very much the core technology. You find it in most of what we do. But in reality, we have become a much broader technology company over time, simply because if we see a need, a user need, that is not being met, we will have a tendency to go establish a position and a new technology if we need to. So I'm afraid that may not be terribly helpful to you, but I think to you, but I think I would regard us as being a company that goes for, to looking for markets that are underserved by technology where we can make a difference, maybe even a transforming difference in that industry.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: My first question is on Europe and sitting around those concerns you referenced are the conservatism. Could you describe whether your Europe business was up year-over-year if you were to exclude acquisitions in the first quarter?
Rajat Bahri: Yes, it was. And when we say Europe conservatism it's we just is as Steve said it's in the back half without having any visibility. I mean if you see our Q1 numbers are good and our Q2 guidance is also higher than what we had told you to what that expectations were. So I just want to make sure that those facts are clear.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, perhaps just some qualitative commentary, Steve, about the -- what you're seeing in the North American construction side? It sounds like maybe you're starting to see a little bit of an uptick there.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. Well, I think in terms of heavy, kind of the heavy and highway, the machine control oriented business as well as the, what's called the affiliated survey instruments business. What we're seeing there is quite a strong environment. We're getting -- we saw significant growth in both of those categories in the first quarter. When it comes to building construction, the actual construction of buildings, most of what I'm referring to, let's call it as, at the levels of anecdote or -- but whereas a year ago or 2 years ago, or certainly 3 years ago, there was no optimism, there was really no dialogue. I think what you're seeing at this point in time even though it is not really necessarily turned into dollars yet, I think there is a growing belief is that for example, the rental market for rental real estate market is tightening up or is -- and there may be opportunities and money may begin to flow in projects there. I think, what the, albeit slow economic growth in the country is the demand for commercial office space or factories and such, is becoming more likely than less likely at this point in time. So I think that we're anticipating is that it may not be a major recovery anytime soon and the U.S. election may send people to the sidelines for a period of time, just waiting to see how that comes out. But I think there is a sense is that, okay unlike the conditions of 1, 2 or 3 years ago, is that there is the likelihood of some level of activity. And as I've said before, if we see any kind of recovery in that realm, our cost base is still, is already in place. So the incremental effect, the marginal effect on us if there is any kind of recovery in building construction is going to be pretty respectable when it comes to bottom line impact. So I think we're still waiting and watching, but I think that we're waiting and watching with some anticipation that sometime in the next year we're likely to start seeing the market start to show some recovery in money terms.
Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: One last quick question. Your guidance levels, your guidance for debt levels includes about $100 million, $150 million increase quarter-over-quarter, which you said was for the acquisition pipeline. Can we assume the bulk of that is for SketchUp?
Rajat Bahri: You know there are 2 or 3 acquisitions and we have not disclosed the SketchUp number, that's the mutual agreement with Google. But, every quarter we do 2 to 3 acquisitions. If you look at Q1, that's what we did. So it's all up, it is captured in that number.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I just wanted to start off with the Tekla business and perhaps what you're seeing there and maybe just a viewpoint on how quickly BIM is being adopted, whether there's been any changes there or just your expectations for that?
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. So I think -- so first of all, Tekla is meeting the expectations that we had when the acquisition was made in the middle of last year. I think that the market is there -- they have a sensor reflecting the state of commercial -- large scale residential buildings. So it's not what I would call a robust market that Tekla is selling into. But I think the -- what we acquired when we acquired Tekla was an already existing international footprint. So if you look at Tekla, probably their relatively most robust market at this point in time that in percentage terms and to a fair extent in kind of euro terms or dollar terms, our country is like India. Tekla is having great success in India, which I think is a very positive sign for the future. So Tekla is selling on a worldwide basis, and able to take advantage of those robust growth markets that do exist out there. The other element of Tekla is the fact that it strategically it represents some opportunities for us as a company, particularly in conjunction with the recent news of SketchUp. But with Tekla, we have a professional direct selling sales force so we can think in terms of creating a comprehensive product line that includes Tekla, but also the mechanical, electrical, plumbing BIM capabilities we have with Plancal as well as the other elements of BIM 5D that we have with Meridian and their software capability. So I think that Tekla in itself represents an opportunity to go with the international markets. They're having some success in North America, but if the North American market comes back at all, and when I talk about kind of the significant marginal effects, Tekla will be one of those significant marginal effects. But I think the, maybe the point to emphasize is that Tekla is already very well represented internationally, and in cases where they're not, such as Brazil, we're leveraging off of Trimble infrastructure in place to give them a kickstart in Brazil. So stepping back and overall looking at BIM, I think it is the technology of the future for building construction. It is -- it was -- and I think in the state of rapid acceptance and then the crash came, and I think it's recovering a bit from the crash at this point in time. But it would be our anticipation that BIM becomes the foundation on which all building construction is done in the future and will, in effect, be able to revolutionize a number of building methods. So for example, if you look at the kind of cutting-edge construction, a lot of construction these days is prefab, fabricated off-site, and whole sections of the building are brought to the site and lifted into place, and BIM is the enabling technology that allows that to happen. So construction sites are going to look more and more like factories, or assembly areas more so than the traditional picture of construction, and I think BIM is the foundation for being able to do things like that. So really against the standard that we established last year, I think we're on track relative to Tekla alone, and I think we're now getting what is called a convergence on a greater concept that really gives us a lot of optimism for the next 5 years as a company in terms of what we can accomplish.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And just one follow-up. Can you maybe break out for us, by segment, the amount of revenue that came from acquisitions this quarter?
Rajat Bahri: We didn't break it by segment, but I can give you a perspective on the total company, if you include Tekla and PeopleNet, the big acquisition, but organic was in the high teens, the growth rate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Valera with Needham.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions on the Mobile Solutions, if I could. First of all, congratulations on getting the 10% operating margin threshold. So the question is, where do you think it can go versus is it sustainable at that level, and where do you think that can go both over the balance of this year and longer term, Steve?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So first of all, yes, it's sustainable and maintainable at this level. The only caution there would be it's a lumpy business and so my encouragement for this segment and really this segment more than any other, there may be a need periodically just to do a little smoothing, a 2-quarter average or a 3-quarter average just to get the baseline effect, because it will tend to be by the nature of it, you get a large contract that is hardware heavy at the front end. That hardware is likely -- could very well, most likely will have lower gross margins than the software content and could distort results in any given quarter, but with that caution aside, I think that we have reached threshold and what's expected to really be a threshold and we don't retreat below that threshold going forward. And then in some sense the longer-term question is the easier question to answer or the question I'll actually focus on more so than trying to predict at the segment level for the rest of the year, which is something we typically don't do. But I think if you look at the structure of the Mobile Solutions businesses and again, you're typically talking software level gross margins so you're typically, in any case, just talking about gross margins that are 60% or better. Now the thing that is not, at least in the early days, was not appropriately considered was the support cost of actually remaining in the business. So that takes a decent bite out of that gross margin just in terms of being able to support the customer base and that doesn't scale so well as, for every 1,000 subscribers you better be putting some amount of support resources in place or you're not going to provide the customer experience. But even at the, even after that effect is the marginal, the incremental effects of that gross margin are pretty heavy. And so over time as the business -- and the other aspects of the businesses should scale pretty well is whether it be R&D, or whether it be that the selling or the other G&A cost, as well as the physical infrastructure, that should scale reasonably well over time. So I would argue that you end up with a pretty high gross margin. You've got scalable expenses below the gross margin line, and as a result, I would say that over time, we should converge on certainly the company and at that new threshold value of 20% as being a reasonable expectation for this business. It will take some time to get there because we have to -- the scale effects will occur incrementally over time, but I would characterize this as being a business that should fit in reasonably well to Trimble's overall portfolio from a profitability standpoint. I just -- having learned that by going out and proclaiming before we did, I don't want to necessarily name the date on any particular margin level simply because we have not done terribly well in that prediction in the past, but I would say continual improvement, incremental improvement should be the order of the day from this point on, and over time, converging on the 20% operating margin and maybe with a couple of more quarters under our belt, and with a little bit more confidence, we can, maybe we can be a little bit more precise on when, but I would say within the next couple of years, as we should be seeing kind of 20% level start to get to be more reasonable, an expectation of 20% operating margins to become more reasonable.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Great, that's helpful, Steve. And then with respect to the revenue level in the business you mentioned in your prepared remarks that I think you're going to expect to continue to see higher churn as you kind of "verticalize" your business, eventually that's sort of I guess, you work through that, but trying to figure out where you're thinking of the revenue level over the near term. Do we have a baseline here in the first quarter that we should think of as maybe flattish throughout this year? Or might you see a little bit of growth as you move through the year?
Steven W. Berglund: I would in general, and again there are some dynamics loose in this business, so I don't want to be overly precise on something where there are as many moving parts as there are. Certainly what I would call the baseline business, which is focused on these more difficult, higher value applications, that business is growing at a reasonable clip at this point in time. It's unfortunate that we cannot press release more of that than we are. But so the baseline is going up at a fairly sharp rate. The old kind of dot on a map functionality business that we, that was kind of when we acquired @Road we acquired a lot of that, and that has become a bit of legacy. We're being very disciplined in terms of how we have -- how we handled that, and I think that over time, that business will come up late a way and it will become a lesser part of the business. And in effect, that's what's happening at this point in time. So I would say is that our general expectation for the year is that after kind of taking out the PeopleNet effect, which is pretty dominant, was pretty dominant this quarter, will be pretty dominant this coming quarter, is that we will show some growth this year, but then I would say that in 2013 we get to see the model, the real model at work and that will be more significant in 2013.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then one final one for me if I could, Raj, any change to your assumptions about incremental margins for the overall business, relative to your last comments?
Rajat Bahri: No, I think we expect around a 25% drop for the full year to the bottom line on incremental revenue. Q1 was slightly better than that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrea James with Dougherty & Company.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: So what would subscription revenue have looked like, I guess, as a percent of the total even at a year ago, and what are your expectations for where it goes?
Rajat Bahri: Well, a year ago we were at $23 million -- $24 million. Now we are at $46 million. So part of it is acquisitions. Part of it is some organic growth. So clearly our subscription revenue is a much bigger part of our business than it was a year ago.
Steven W. Berglund: And as far as where it will go, so certainly the comparison 2011 to 2012 is a little artificial just because of the acquisition effect. But certainly, we, if you look at the long baseline apples for apples at a point 5 or 6 years ago, it would have been a much smaller number relative to total revenues than it is today. So I think it does reflect the changing nature of the company. It will certainly tend to grow over time, and the reason I'm being maybe less than precise in terms of what I'm saying, is that there is, there's software sold as a product, whether it be shrink-wrapped or a license, either in conjunction with hardware or stand-alone, that's still in this SEC-mandated categorization is still in product. So to a certain level, we are indifferent in terms of whether we are selling a software license or whether we're selling it as a service. And so these descriptions do mask a little bit of that. So I would say I don't know that we have a percentage target that we would, that we've ever considered in terms of subscriptions. But I think that we see it as strategic and in basically all the Trimble businesses. So in Mobile Solutions it's certainly key, but increasingly in Engineering Construction it is becoming a fundamental element of the total solution we're selling, whether it be BIM-related or whether it be Heavy and Highway related, and even we see things like Cadastral Surveying as potentially being -- it being potentially relevant for Cadastral Surveying and even for Agriculture when we talk about the Connected Farm aspects kind of software becomes more important and some of that software will be sold in subscription form. So I don't have a good answer, in fact, because we've never actually defined it that way as a company, but it is becoming certainly strategic across the company, this kind of evolving transformation. And I would expect the service and subscription categories to continue to increase as a percentage of total company revenue. I just don't know where the -- what the endgame or the steady-state ultimately is. But they will certainly continue to grow as a percentage over time.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: No, that is helpful. And so if you had, say, an unbundled piece of subscription revenue, what does the distribution look like that, compared to one that's bundled with a product or a service?
Steven W. Berglund: It won't necessarily be, you will have a tendency to be more direct, simply because the businesses that are heavy on subscription sales such as transportation and logistics tend to be more direct. But the message is that I think that it will be a mixed system. So for example, the SITECHs out there that we're creating, the SITECH dealers that we're creating on the E&C side will be selling subscriptions as part of their business. We would expect a number of other direct dealer elements of the Trimble distribution channel also to be selling subscriptions. It will have a tendency to be more direct than the product sales, but it won't be, let's call it, pure either way, but it will be mixed, but with a heavy, heavier emphasis of direct than indirect than most of our other businesses, traditional businesses have been.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Moving on to TMS. Are you still trimming some of your customers there and should we look at modeling that in? Or I guess the net effect is we don't really see it. Is that right? Other than the margins. Go ahead.
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think it's the swap out. So that's why I think that there is -- we're not necessarily reflecting the underlying baselines of the business because there's the swap out that's occurring. But yes, so I think that a -- we would expect over time is the kind of the more horizontal lower functionality customers either to become a significantly lesser part of the total business or as they go look for the cheapest prices available, they may find themselves with somebody other than Trimble. So I think that will occur. But I think the largest effects will be during 2012, so I'm hoping that we're back to a baseline in 2013, it becomes a little bit more clear.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I have a couple of questions. I want to talk about the Ag business a little bit, if we could. And if you could, talk to us a little bit about the recent trends within the Ag business in terms of which product lines are driving the strength in particular if you could talk about whether it's more of the traditional guidance products or whether some of the advanced functionality like up to and including Connected Farm are starting to gain some more traction?
Steven W. Berglund: Sure. So certainly from a hard quantitative perspective is the mainstay of the business is still the guidance products. Those that drive tractors up and down rows in very straight, highly precise lines but at the same time, the same comment we made last quarter is still true, which is the emerging areas, the more informational oriented areas, the variable rate control software, those categories are actually growing at a significantly faster rate than the traditional. So what is taking place? It's not hugely meaningful yet because of the still strong growth and strong position of guidance. But the mix is changing in the business as the new categories of product are actually growing more, significantly more rapidly than the others. So I think 2, 3 years out it's going to be a much more balanced portfolio. But yes, the trends are loose and they're now consistent quarter after quarter. So I think we're very much encouraged by that, and what we're doing and the concept of the Connected Farm really is catching hold. We talked last quarter about U.S. Sugar as being something of a flagship and accepting and embracing the technology. So for example, the Florida operations are being recast around our technology and really around what we've been calling the Connected Farm. So I think there are other examples that are better occurring. But yes, so the trend, that is very much the trend. It's a very encouraging trend for the longer term, both in terms of growth and margin maintenance.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then sort of slicing that data in a little different way, can you talk a little bit about aftermarket versus OEM sales in Field Solutions and what the sort of at least qualitative breakdown is there? And then specifically, in terms of aftermarket, do you kind of buy the logic that given how strong OEM machinery sales have been the last few years, that the aftermarket opportunity has really exploded? And is that kind of the right way to look at that? Is that the way you guys are looking at it in the aftermarket distribution channel?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes. So I think in terms of the aftermarket versus OEM mix, it is over time, evolving towards more factory fit. We anticipated that, we anticipated that 10 years ago, and it's been much slower to evolve on both the construction side and the agricultural side. But the market is still very much dominated by aftermarket sales and retrofitting on equipment after it's left the factory, and maybe a new piece of equipment, but in reality, it's been the, capability is being put on in the field. And I think that, that's going to be the way it is for some period of time, even though I think there will be a slow migration towards factory-installed. And one of the considerations here that is not yet resolved and may take some time to resolve -- it's more true on the construction side that it is on the agriculture side, but the whole concept of the mixed fleet, which is whether it be a farmer, or whether it be a contractor, there's going to be a certain amount of resistance to simply adopting whatever happens to be put on the machine in the factory, if you got machinery from multiple manufacturers, the farmer or the contractor's going to want a solution networks for all the different colors of the equipment. And so their issues are unresolved at this point in time, but I think there will -- I've got a bias towards what the answer will be, but I think there will always tend to be a strong aftermarket element of this, just to deal with a farmer or a contractor who's got a mixed fleet and who wants the best available technology for that mixed fleet, and there will be resistance to simply taking whatever's installed on the factory. So I don't know that, I think the aftermarket remains viable. I think it will continue to grow. And in places like China, we're getting very strong growth in China, for example, at this point in time, a market that we've only really touched effectively in the last 2 or 3 years. So I think it will play out somewhat differently internationally. I don't know if there's words like explosive, necessarily words that I would choose to use, but I would say there's going to be, for the time being, a robust growth in the aftermarket and I don't think it's going to disappear quickly and will not really disappear ever at all, but I think it will find a new balance over time between factory install and field install.
Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then just one final question from me, more of a tactical shorter-term issue, but a number of the companies in the OEM side have talked -- have had very strong quarterly results as well, and have talked about, kind of early planting season and relatively mild weather as somewhat of a factor. Do you have any sense for whether that was a factor at all in the exceptionally strong results in Field Solutions in this quarter here?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes, it certainly had an effect. It was -- every year is a new adventure in terms of what the weather patterns will be, and it's not just North America, it's Europe, it's Australia, it's Brazil. But I think that farmers were able to get into the field earlier this year because of the early spring or early departure of winter, or whatever it was. So I think that we got a beneficial impact in the first quarter. But that has happened and that's happening in one sense or another every year, depending on which geography we're talking about. But without a doubt, it helped our -- it helped to some degree our results in the first quarter simply because we probably got a late quarter boost that we don't typically have. But I wouldn't necessarily call it a step function sort of thing. It was just -- it added some icing onto the cake in the first quarter. And the question that I think we've got baked into our numbers is whether, okay, did that move any of the revenue from the second quarter into the first quarter, and we'll see, but I think we've anticipated that effect fairly conservatively in our second quarter numbers.
Operator: And there are currently no questions in the queue at this time.
Steven W. Berglund: There are no other questions? Thank you for participating, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Marvin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 and Year End 2011 Conference Call. (Operator instructions) I’ll now hand the call over to our host, Ms. Willa McManmon. Ma’am, you may begin.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the Company’s Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release. The press release and additional financial statements are posted on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press releases. I will now turn the call over to Steve Berglund, our CEO and Rajat Bahri, our CFO.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Fourth quarter results demonstrated the momentum which was evident throughout 2011. Its momentum is carrying us into 2012 and enables us to expect another strong year, subject to the strong positionality of the euro crisis and its effects on the world economy. At the beginning of 2011 we anticipated revenue growth for the year in the neighborhood of 20% based on a combination of strong organic growth combined with incremental effects of acquisitions. We assumed we would not see a robust economic recovery during 2011 and, in particular, we assumed we would not see a recovery in the commercial and residential construction markets. Overall, the environment provided us with no meaningful negative surprises aside from a slower than anticipated market in China. We exceeded our original expectations with annual revenue growth of 27%, largely because our acquisition activity during the year was higher than originally expected. Entering 2012 our snapshot view is quite similar to a year ago. With our natural forecasting limitations which result from our characteristic of being a book and burn business, we believe our existing portfolio of businesses should once again generate total year revenue growth in the neighborhood of 20%. This is a combination of strong organic growth topped by the full year of active acquisitions already made. The most significant difference between the two years is the higher level of economic uncertainty created by the euro crisis, which is not unique to Trimble. If the crisis is resolved early, it could remove uncertainty and enhance the outlook. If it lurches along, it creates significant uncertainty and could impair investment decisions in Europe. If it ends in a collapse in the euro it will have worldwide significance. 2011 reflected progression within all the Trimble strategic themes. We expanded our international reach, particularly in the emerging markets by adding development, manufacturing and sales capabilities. We actively pursued our longstanding strategy of moving away from sensors and products towards a focus on higher-value, industry-specific solutions. The beneficial long-term impact of the higher-value content is seen in the aggregate gross margin of the Company, which has expanded by 3.4 percentage points from 2006 to 2011 reflecting the increased bundling of hardware, software and service. We also continue to both deepen and broaden our technology base in support of the solutions focus. This is reflected in the increasing software content in our products with more than 60% of our technical personnel currently engaged in software development. The quarterly performance for the three most strategically and important segments, E&C, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions was again strong. E&C reflected organic growth and heavy in highway and survey instruments, as well as the Tekla acquisition. These improvements in E&C were delivered in spite of a still dormant commercial and residential construction market in the U.S. and most parts of Europe. Slower sales in China related to the recent problems specific to railway construction and generally more deliberate decision-making process across Europe. In a positive context and in contrast to the last four years, there's at least some discussion in the U.S. of the possibility of increased activity in the commercial and residential construction market later in the year. The field solutions segment again demonstrated strong year-to-year growth with contributions from agriculture, GIS, and acquisitions. Agricultural performance reflects the attractiveness of our solutions within the backdrop of a relatively strong agricultural economy around the world. In the quarter, agriculture provided two pieces of evidence supporting the viability of the company trend towards greater value-added solutions.  The first was the growth in the relatively new product categories of flow controls and information management, which grew by approximately 85% in the quarter year-over-year. The second was the press release announcing Trimble's new relationship with US Sugar. This is significant because it demonstrates that there is additional [untapped] growth available to us by providing targeted solutions to specific large agricultural segments and also because U.S. Sugar's vision transcends any particular farm operation and is centered on the connected farm, which is central to Trimble's strategy. GIS, although still negatively impacted by municipal and state budgetary constraints, had a strong double-digit revenue quarter and grew slightly faster than agriculture with similar margins. This demonstrates that despite the considerable and deserved attention agriculture has received in the last several years, other profitable but less visible Trimble product categories provides significant growth potential.  The mobile solutions segment quarterly results remained ahead of our original estimate and made major contribution to the year-to-year margin improvement, as a result of both acquisition and operating improvements. While our results are still near our long-term model for the segment we expect the segment to provide meaningful contributions throughout 2012 to company-wide earnings improvement. Key to the improvement in mobile solutions is the redirection of the portfolio towards vertical markets through acquisitions, selective pruning of the existing subscriber portfolio, and new initiatives.  The core vertical markets reported in the segment are [Four Street], construction supply, transportation and logistics, communications, environmental, field services, and public safety. Our industry focuses to move beyond the commoditized dot on a map, horizontal functionality to add specific value-added capabilities that are relevant to these industries such as safety, compliance, carbon reduction, diagnostics, and RFID solutions. By providing this increased value we will be able to both create competitive differentiation and expand gross margin. Advanced devices segment margins remained strong albeit without much current growth. We expect 2012 to be a relatively quite year for the segment although we have a number of longer term growth possibilities based on technologies under development.  We entered 20012 with a strong portfolio that is dynamic and capable of producing significant growth over the next few years. At the same time we understand the vulnerabilities of the economic environment and the potential for significant dislocations, which would affect the willingness of our customers to invest. However, with the environment as it exists today, we look forward to the year with some confidence. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri: Fourth quarter 2011 non-GAAP operating income in Field Solutions are $34.7 million or 36.3% of revenue, as compared to $27.6 million or 36.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010. Without the impact of a technical acquisition in Field Solutions operating margins were up for the quarter.  Fiscal 2011 Field Solutions revenue was $413.7 million, up 30% as compared to fiscal 2010. Due primarily to strong sales across the product line and, to a lesser extent, the Tekla acquisition. Fiscal 2011 Field Solution non-GAAP operating income was $162.4 million or 39.3% of revenue, as compared to $118.4 million, or 37.2% of revenue in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP operating margins were up due to operating leverage on increased revenue. Fourth quarter 2011 Mobile Solutions revenue was $75.8 million, up 88% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to the People Net acquisition. The base business also demonstrated double digit organic growth. Fourth quarter 2011 Mobile Solutions non-GAAP operating income was $6.4 million, or 8.5% of revenue, as compared to operating income of $931,000, or 2.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due to People Net acquisition and increased profitability from our base business.  The fiscal 2011 Mobile Solutions revenue was $218.5 million, up 42% as compared to fiscal 2010. Primarily due to People Net acquisition and growth within the base business, partially offset by the loss of a large customer in the second quarter of 2010. Fiscal 2011 Mobile Solutions non-GAAP operating income was $7.4 million, or 3.4% of revenue, as compared to operating income of $5.3 million, or 3.4% of revenue in fiscal 2010.  Fourth quarter 2011 Advanced Devices revenue was $25.2 million, up 2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2011 non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $4.1 million, or 16.1% of revenue, as compared to $4 million, or 16.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Fiscal 2011 Advanced Devices revenue was $105.3 million, up 3% as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 Advanced Devices non-GAAP operating income was $16.5 million, or 15.6% of revenue, as compared to operating income of $20.3 million, or 19.8% of revenue in fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP operating margins were down versus the prior year due primarily to product mix. In the fourth quarter of 2011 52% of revenue came from North America, 23% from Europe, 16% from the Asian Pacific, and 9% from the rest of the world. The year-over-year growth rate by region was 41% in North America, 18% in Asia-Pacific, 36% in Europe, and 31% in the rest of the world. Europe was up double digits, excluding Tekla.

Steve Berglund:
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: OK. And one last question just from a model standpoint. Ex PeopleNet was Mobile Solutions profitable in the fourth quarter?
Rajat Bahri: Yes, it was. 
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: OK. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty & Company. 
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company: Hi there, Good Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Does it seem like PMS seemed to even surprise you guys on the upside? Could you just give us some details about what went right there? Did you sign new customers or what happened?
Steve Berglund: No, in actuality I think we're simply running maybe a quarter ahead of where we thought we were. So 2011, late 2010 and mostly the first part of 2011, the first half of 2011 was really kind of a re-orientation, a re-calibration, a re-structuring period where we reinforced the direction of verticalization. So there was a fair amount of change that occurred in the early and mid part of 2011. We were quite confident about the fourth quarter, but in reality, the fourth quarter happened in the third quarter, and maybe the first quarter happened in the fourth quarter. So, as far as the fundamentals, we simply running a bit ahead of our original game plan. I think during the fourth quarter there were some surprises that walked through the door that we weren't expecting. But I would say that fundamentally this is not necessarily the kind of fourth quarter serendipity. I think it's more sort of a long-term trend line, more then anything else, in terms of the profitability.
Andrea James - Dougherty & Company: OK. Just moving over to field solutions. Can you just talk about pricing there and what you’re seeing out in the channel in terms of pricing pressure? Are prices holding steady?
Steve Berglund: Yeah, if we're talking agricultural. I think really the statement I could make, with a fair amount of intellectual honesty, there has been long-term price fidelity in agricultural. I think that if you took the premier products in agriculture and plotted them since back towards 2004, 2005 those prices have really remained quite steady. We have led on the low-end products because we believe that market is elastic. A couple times in our past we have actually dropped prices there, because we believe the market is elastic and it turned out it was elastic.

Ajit Pai - Stifel Nicolaus:
Steven Berglund:
Ajit Pai - Stifel Nicolaus: Is it reasonable to get to a 20% operating margin in the mobile solutions space? I think, fundamentally, it is driven by the view that it is ultimately a software business, the mix between hardware and software in any quarter will skew that a bit, but over time the software part of the business, software delivered as a service in most cases, will increase. That will typically bring with it margins, in some cases, well above 50%. The scale factors below the line in terms of infrastructure and R&D and all of those things should scale nicely. So, we should be able to march consistently towards, first, a consistent double-digit operating margin, but there is nothing to say that this is not a 20% operating margin business in a few years.

Ajit Pai - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. The last question would be just looking at the tremendous cash flow generation and the pay down of debt, so if you had to (inaudible) use of cash right now and the cash flow generation, would you say that debt pay down is still probably the highest priority? Also, the current cash flow generation, do you think the current level is sustainable with a drop from there seasonally or could it continue to grow through this year?
Steve Berglund: Well, I'll let Raj answer the expectation question in terms of the numbers. But what I would say is, in terms of the current debt level and we currently have a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 35%, with a cash generating characteristics of this company, in good times and bad times, we're not uncomfortable with this debt level. So, I would say our number one priority is probably not deleveraging. I think it’s basically we'll scan the opportunities and make rational decisions. But I think that we're a technology company and technology companies typically don't carry much debt, but at the same time is the current level of debt is easily in our ability to handle. So, I would say is we'll make rational decisions, but I would not declare leveraging our number one priority of the company at this point.
Ajit Pai - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company: Great quarter, guys. Just wanted to start out on the E&C side. You've talked a little bit about the BIM space and some pickups in demand in the past and there's been some movement up and down. Can you talk about that and also the potential margin flow through of some of the maintenance revenue that comes back with Tekla in that segment?
Steve Berglund: OK, I'll let Raj track to the numbers again, but, basically, I think it was a busier 2011 and a little bit of that has come into 2012 with the acquisition of Tekla, the acquisition of (inaudible), the very small acquisition of StruCad but we have, in the last 12 months, combined with what he had done previously, built out a relatively full set of capabilities in BIM covering mechanical, electrical, plumbing, as well as the structural steel aspects. We have the meridian capability which kind of extends us into what's called BIM 5D which is the three dimensional model plus costs plus schedule. Then with the Hilti joint venture we have what's called the ability to project, kind of BIM to field physical tools in the marketplace. As far as capability is concerned we've built out a relatively full set here. I think that the financial impact will truly come when we see any life at all in commercial and large scale residential. The market is still very quiet in Europe and in the US. What we will see, I think, when we see any kind of recovery, and it doesn't have to be a large recovery, but any kind of recovery we're going to see again a significant step up in performance of ENC.  Thus far with Tekla and the software pieces that have been previously acquired, QuickPen and Accubid and anticipate with [Plankel] we're going to have a group of margin rich software businesses here with gross margins well above 50% and the ability to generate very significant operating margins. I think we've got the strategic pieces in place. We're operating as a reasonably high level at this point in time. When we see any kind of recovery in commercial and residential I think we're going to see a significant increase in performance out of those areas.  Raj, anything else? Guess not.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company: Just to, I guess, take a look at the Ag business. As you guys look at 2012, clearly you've had a very strong growth year in 2011, how do we break out the growth between sort of the new product areas that you're going to be launching? Contributions from flow control and some of the lower penetrated and then just your core business? Just the incremental growth, where do you see that coming from?
Steven Berglund: Well, there's a baseline business which relates to guidance. Now, there's a high end and a lower end element there. The autopilot, which is the high end, tends to operate to a bit of a different dynamic than the low end. That's the baseline business which is guidance. Then we have added the new connected farm elements which is information management, flow controls, but taking advantage of the fact that there is a GPS receiver on the roof of the cabin and that there's a computer in the cab and leveraging them to this prescription agriculture applications. The baseline business will continue for the foreseeable future to grow at meaningful double digits maybe not prodigious double digits that we saw a few years ago but let's call it strong very respectable double digits.  As I pointed out in the script is the new add-ons, although not terribly significant against the backdrop of the size of the business at this point in time, but the flow controls and the information management products combine in the forth quarter year-over-year grew at 85%. That may not be the long term average but I say those products probably have the ability to grow at greater than 40% for the foreseeable future. So what we're going to see here is a change in blend in that business, probably with no impact at all in operating margins. The more information based, the add-ons, the prescriptions farming elements of the products start to become a larger and larger portion of it. But again, we still see the baseline business based around guidance and still be a good strong double-digit growth for 3 to 5 years before we have to consider the level of maturity of the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to be super clear because we gotten a lot of questions on this. The operating margins you're enjoying in Ag right now seem high for relative to a lot of other businesses. Are they sustainable if they decline what would the shape of the curve of the decline? How are you able to earn operating margins at this level?
Steven Berglund: OK. First of all, there are a number of businesses within Trimble that don't get quite the same visibility that our earning operating margins at this level. I pointed out the GIS margins are very close to those. So the existence there is probably questionable in terms of the fact that this is unique. The question basically is this business going to be commoditized. As I pointed out there has been price stability since 2004 to now. So there's been 7 to 8 years of price stability in terms of the high end product.  OK. So what will cause prices to fall. If you go back over that same period, the competitors in the industry have remained largely unchanged. There have been no new competitive entries into the business over that period of time. The OEM content is still quite low in terms of factory installings, likely to remain low for the foreseeable future. It remains an aftermarket business.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: My belief and expectation is that Trimble has cost position on manufacturers on the low end. The high end which is automatic guidance system is steering and controlling throttle is a much more stable market. It is much more of a solution sale. The customer there is typically a large commercial scale farmer. They make decisions very much in the same way that any other large enterprise would make it. I point back to US Sugar as a prime example of that.  So in reality it's a technology market. It will undergo changes over time. The current bubble of dynamics in this marketplace is not all that different than they would have been five years ago.

Ryan Connors - Janney Montgomery: OK, again along that same vein, is there any indication of any change in the way the OEM's view this part of their product? In other words there has been some discussion in the investment community about OEM's look at precision Ag as a way to sell machines rather than a product in and of itself. Therefore that drives some over time less of a desire to invent more and more technology and therefore have some negative impact on pricing and margin. What are your thoughts on that?
Steven Berglund: I think there are courses of history there so. I go back to the time when I joined Trimble in 1999, if we had remained static, if we had simply continued to view the business as we did we would have ceased to exist by now. So at the base censor level, if you view yourself as a censor company and act out that part you do eventually become imbedded in someone else's system.  I think if you look to the press release that CNH put out on the updated relationship with Trimble. The primary focus is on technology and technology development using technology as a way to sell heavy metal but not as a give away but as a point of differentiation. For the time being this is a technology market.

Rajat Bahri : I think Steve pointed out that we started profitability in Q3 and it will be a progression every quarter and things will start getting incrementally better as more subscription revenue comes, which is more profitable. That's what's playing out, it's just that we are a quarter, maybe a quarter and a half ahead of where we thought we would be, in terms of the subscription revenue. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Rath with Canaccord.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Great. Thanks guys. A just a couple of follow-ups. Raj can you talk about the margin impact of Tekla, given that you're not recognizing material profits now and that will reverse. Is there any way that you can speak to that a little bit more quantitatively? What would the E&C margins have been without Tekla? And then maybe as you think about where the Tekla reversal will take E&C margins on a go forward basis once that reverses? Can you just walk me through that?
Rajat Bahri: The easiest way to tell you is that in the first half and the later six months that we've had Tekla there's approximately at least $10 million in revenue and profit that has not gone to the bottom line. So you can equate it roughly to $5 million to $6 million a quarter. That will come back starting in Q1. We should start seeing normal margins from that, so roughly you would say a point to a point and a half of margin was depressed because of Tekla in Q4 for E&C 
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: A couple of quick ones here and then I'm done. Given that you've stepped up your acquisition strategy Raj, throughout 2012. How should we think about the amortization run rate here? I'm assuming $35.5 is probably a little low. How do we think about that throughout the year, given that's more accounting driven? 
Rajat Bahri: I would, at this point, assume that for the rest of the year, and if we do more acquisitions we'll update that guidance. It doesn't impact non-GAAP numbers. 
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams:   I understand that.
Rajat Bahri: I can't tell you the number because I don't know what future acquisitions will close at what time. But that number just represents acquisitions closed so far.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: And then last one here is just for Steve. Steve you referenced it on your scripted remarks. I'm wondering if you could just expand on it a little bit. The US Sugar deal, it sounds like you were calling that out as a flagship deal on what you're pursuing within the Ag and Connective Farm. Can you expand on that comment?
Steven Berglund: Sure. Partly I was just being opportunistic because we don't often have the opportunity to press release a specific customer in Ag, but I think it is representative in a couple of ways. First of all, US Sugar is approaching this in what I would call a fairly visionary way. They're not looking to improve any single aspect of the business. They're looking to improve the enterprise. One of the selling points that we had and one of the points that I think they're emphasizing is this connect to farm. Looking at all operations of the farm and applying technology right across. From kind of planning all the way through harvesting and, basically, potentially to the transport of sugar cane to the mill and, for all I know, beyond that. I think it represents a little bit of new age thinking in terms of it as opposed to talking about auto guidance and such, talking about all the farm operations in terms of how technology can lift the enterprise across the board. I think the other aspect here that I touched on is if you look at sugar cane, for example, and let's just say I'm becoming more acquainted with sugar cane than I have historically. Whether that or another one we've used is vineyards. There are a lot of high value or significant value crops. Many of them, there's a high time sensitivity in terms of when things are done and there is little forgiveness to logistically not doing them at the right time.  But whether it be sugar cane or whether it be vineyards or any other number of, let's call it, relatively targeted farm segment. I think there's a realm here to, just as we're trying to do elsewhere in the company in terms of verticalization and trying to focus on specific customer segments and craft very specific solutions for those industries. I think there's the ability to do that same in agriculture. Which is pick out some of the specialty segments and define very sharply focused solutions for them. I think that adds, let's call it, a realm of growth that we have not historically had in the portfolio.  I think that yes, we have substantial growth potential still left in kind of the baseline businesses of running up and down corn fields and wheat fields and the like. I think U.S. sugar represents the ability to add an incremental growth area based on focused solutions for individual segments. I think it's not hugely significant in its own right from a dollar standpoint, although it's meaningful, but I think it represents the ability to continue to develop this agricultural business into something larger than it is today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Research. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Good afternoon everyone. I just have a follow up. I apologize if you answered it because I got bounced off the call about five minutes ago and had to come back on. The question is, the carry over acquisitions of what you've made so far, how much is carry over by segment? I have an estimate of that, it looks like it's about $114, $115 million of sales carryover in '12 versus '11 from the acquisitions you've made. Is that about right or how does it break down by group?
Rajat Bahri: Well, I think Steve mentioned the 20% growth rate roughly, the organic growth rate in the teens. This carry over acquisition impact gets us into the 20's.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Can you give us what the carry over acquisitions are by segment? 
Rajat Bahri: We haven't disclosed that, Eli.
Steven Berglund: Bulk of it would be in E&C and Mobile Solutions.
Rajat Bahri: Yeah. 
Steven Berglund: PeopleNet and Tekla would be the most significant ones so it would be largely E&C and Mobile Solutions would be the two segments?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Yeah, I know that. I'm just trying to get the magnitude, because I get that the two of those probably are roughly 60 million each in the carry over this year. I was just wondering with that sort of approximation.
Steven Berglund: Again, we're reluctant to start to break out individual segments in terms of the detail.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: OK. How far away are you from normalizing profitability in the E&C business back to the 20% plus level? I guess you consider that ore norm for that business.
Steven Berglund: Well, we're stepping back to the 20%. I think the difference between now and then, yes. We were at 20% in E&C. I think the most significant factor that will get us back there in a relative hurry will be any kind of revival in commercial and residential construction. Let's just say, in those business we a re a relative shadow of what we were in 2007 for example. I suppose 2007 was the peak period. But we still at levels that are way down from the levels of 2007 so they are profitable. In a couple of cases they are quite profitable but at the same time, to get back to 20% quickly would require some type of--not back to the 2007 levels--but some kind of revival at all in commercial and residential construction simply because those markets are very dormant at this point in time outside Nordic countries and maybe a little bit of Germany. I thinks that's maybe the most significant determination of how quickly we get back to 20% at least quickly. But we are stepping in that direction.
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, this year we finished at 17.6% and next year there will be at least 100 basis points if not more improvement. So yeah, we'll be in the neighborhood of 19 now that there's a step up in commercial and residential in the back half and we get more revenue, there's a shot that we may have a run rate of that by year end next year. But we'll be close to around the neighborhood of 19% next year.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: I mean you had talked about getting to those double-digit margins in mobile solutions. That looks like a pretty reasonable target would those double digits in 2012?
Steven Berglund: Yeah, that's certainly our expectation.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: And one final question. You have a 15% to 17% tax rate that you're guiding us to for 2012. Would that continue to go up in '13? And I know you're worried about '12 but we have to think of more than one year?
Rajat Bahri: I think long term I expected it'll be some years maybe a couple of points lower than that. In some years, maybe a couple of points higher than that, it depends upon the mix of income, where it comes from, but I think 15 to 17 is a long-term average rate is the right way to think about it, unless something changes in legislation.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with CHAM. 
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Good morning, or good afternoon I should say. Most of my questions have been answered. Have you addressed where margins could go on the upside from here? Because most of the questions seem to have been when can they come down and when will they revert to the mean and so on. On the gross margins side how much higher can they go once your volume picks up from the recovering construction that is definitely coming?
Steven Berglund: OK, well thanks for asking the upbeat question of the day. I think in some ways we can play out the arithmetic together but I think you've already figured out what the leverage points are. For example, although we don't break out the commercial and residential related part of ENC it's a meaningful part of that. The gross margins overall, particularly with the BIM business, software oriented businesses in it, are at least consistent with the company average gross margin. We have the cost base in place for those in terms of R&D spending, sales force, all those sorts of things.  What we would get if we saw any sort of upturn in commercial and residential would be, let's call it, a high leverage coming from these businesses. I think the modeling aspects of that are relatively straight forward but I think would be enough to move the needle for the segment and for the company. I would say that is maybe, if we're going to talk about an upside scenario, that is maybe the first one on the list. Which is any kind of revival in residential and commercial.  I think the other, looking at the portfolio, the other upside scenario would be in Mobile Solutions. Yeah, we're seeing improvement there and the growth there has been relatively moderate, the baseline organic growth there has been relatively moderate because we're, in effect, kind of pruning the subscriber base. We're actually being selective in terms of what business we want and what business we don't want. I think there is the possibility there if we start to see any kind of movement on the top line in Mobile Solutions maybe more aggressively than we've been showing.  Again, there's a case where you've got very strong incremental gross margins that would have a tendency to drop to the operating line, maybe with some discomfort for sales costs but we have the R&D base already in place there. We have the physical structure and so that would leverage up fairly high.

Operator: Welcome, everyone, to the Trimble Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Willa McManmon.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors including the competitive nature of the marketplace, the condition of the worldwide economy, and other factors detailed in the company’s Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release. The press release and additional financial statements are posted on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables to our press release. I will now turn the call over to Steve Berglund, our CEO; and Rajat Bahri, our CFO.
Steven Berglund: Good afternoon. The third quarter was consistent with the second quarter, in that it provided a sense of confidence about medium-term prospects and the state of the financial model. This momentum was demonstrated in our three most strategically important segments: E&C, Field Solutions, and Mobile Solutions. Our results, of course, contrast to the current negative public commentary about the macroeconomic environment. But, we are seeing more deliberation on major buying decisions as a result of headline negativism. We have not seen signs that point to a meaningful market slowdown, although a few of our markets have not yet recovered from the last recession and represent more upside than downside. The strong revenue growth in E&C reflected both strong organic growth and the Tekla acquisition. Profitability for the segment was distorted because of short-term purchase accounting effects associated with the acquisition and did not fully reflect the revenue profile. Although we saw continuing strong growth in heavy and highway in the quarter, we also saw continuing improvements in survey instruments and other businesses in the segment. These improvements in E&C were delivered in spite of a commercial and residential construction – parts of Europe. Slower sales in China related to the recent problems specific to railway construction and the slower, more deliberate decision-making process by some of our customers. The Tekla transition continues to progress, and we are increasingly engaged in the market with the BIM 5D and BIM to Field offering that includes Tekla, the Accubid, and QuickPen products, our build construction products and the products from our joint venture with Hilti. This product range provides a contractor with significant potential to lower costs. The Field Solutions segment once again demonstrated a strong year-to-year growth, with contributions from both agriculture and GIS. The agricultural performance was driven by continuing strength in the agricultural economy around the world as well as – and expanding product range. GIS, although still negatively impacted by budgetary constraints at the state and local level, reflects the effects of new products and early results of greater focus on vertical markets. The Mobile Solutions segment’s quarterly results provide an inflection point compared to the recent past. One reason for the positive change is the rework of the business model over the last profitability. Another reason is more significant and is the redirection of the portfolio towards vertical markets, both through acquisition and the selective pruning of the existing subscriber portfolio. The core vertical markets reported in this segment are forestry, construction supply, transportation and logistics, communications, environmental, field services, and public safety. Our industry-focused emphasis is to move beyond broad-dot-on-a-map horizontal functionality, to add specific value and the capabilities that are relevant to these industries such as safety, diagnostics, and our 5D solutions. By providing this increased value, we will be able to both create competitive differentiation and expand gross margin. Mobile Solutions segment profitability was reestablished in the quarter, and we believe we have a path to a significant expansion of segment profitability in 2012. Beyond improved profitability, we are taking steps to establish a unique worldwide strategic position. We have enhanced our original base business with the recent acquisitions of PeopleNet, Punch Telematix in Europe, Tata Automotive Mobility Technologies in India, and Yamei in China. These provide us both access to growth markets as well as substantial scale. The Advanced Devices segment results recovered as expected from first half performance based on strong performance from Applanix. We have additional future upside potential within the segment as ThingMagic, which was acquired in 2010, integrates into Trimble product offerings and begins to produce profits. In summary, we believe we remain on track to exceed our stated financial targets for the entire year, with momentum carrying us into next year. Our outlook for 2012 is positive, and we expect solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth. On the one hand, this view assumes that the economy does not decline dramatically. On the other hand, it does not assume any meaningful recovery in the commercial and residential construction market. If that were to occur, it could provide meaningful additional upside. Let’s turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri: Good afternoon. I will now cover the non-GAAP numbers in my prepared remarks today. Our GAAP numbers as well as a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation are available in today’s earnings press release. Today, we announced third quarter 2011 revenue of $417.4 million, up approximately 31% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Tekla contributed $15.2 million in revenue for the quarter. This was approximately $7 million lower than the baseline revenue, primarily due to the non-cash write-down of deferred revenue. We expect these write-downs to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding Tekla, the top-line growth rate was 26%. Third quarter 2011 non-GAAP operating income of $73 million was up 39% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.5% as compared to 16.5% in the third quarter of 2010, representing operating leverage of 21%. Excluding Tekla, the operating margin for the total company was 18.4%, compared to 16.5% in the third quarter of 2010, resulting operating leverage of 26%. The tax rate in the quarter was 9% versus 14% in the third quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP net income of $65.7 million for the third quarter of 2011 was up 36% as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2011 were $0.52 as compared to diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39 in the third quarter of 2010. Third quarter 2011 E&C revenue was $241.1 million, up 27% as compared to the third quarter of 2010, driven by strength across most product lines, the positive effects of the SITECH channel, and the acquisition of Tekla. Non-GAAP operating income was $45.2 million or 18.8% of revenue, as compared to $38.5 million or 20.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP operating margin was lower due primarily to a non-cash write-down on a portion of Tekla’s pre-acquisition deferred revenue and resulting profitability. As guided, Tekla is expected to be dilutive in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and accretive beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Third quarter 2011 Field Solutions revenue was $91.1 million, up 35% as compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to growth in sales of both agricultural and geographical information system products and the acquisition of Tekla. Non-GAAP operating income was $31.6 million or 34.7% of revenue as compared to $21.5 million or 32% of revenue in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in non-GAAP operating margin was due to higher revenue. Third quarter 2011 Mobile Solutions revenue was $58.1 million, up 54% as compared to the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to acquisitions, and growth within the base business also contributed. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.2 million or 5.5% of revenue as compared to operating income of $744,000 or 2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2010. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was due to primarily acquisitions and also some improvement in the base business, driven by verticalization of the portfolio. As we guided last quarter, we should continue to see progressive improvement in the Mobile Solutions segment profitability each quarter. Third quarter 2011 Advanced Devices revenue was $27.1 million, up 15% as compared to the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to sales of Applanix products and acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $4.6 million or 17% of revenue as compared to $4.5 million or 19.1% of revenue in the third quarter of 2010. The decline in non-GAAP operating margin was due to product mix and acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2011, 51% of revenue came from North America, 24% from Europe, 15% from Asia-Pacific, and 10% from the rest of the world. The year-over-year growth rate by region was 28% in North America, 13% in Asia-Pacific, 35% in Europe, and 78% in the rest of the world. Europe, excluding Tekla, was still up 22% versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2011 were $150.8 million or 36.1% of revenue, up only slightly as compared to 35.8% in the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to acquisitions. Third quarter 2011 non-GAAP non-operating income was negative $1.6 million versus a profit of $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to greater interest expense, impact of foreign exchange transactions, and change in deferred compensation liabilities; partially offset by higher joint venture profitability. We finished the third quarter of 2011 with $138.3 million in cash compared to $249.8 million in the second quarter of 2011. Our debt level was $637.2 million or 2.2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Accounts receivable for the third quarter of 2011 was $287.7 million as compared to $257.2 million in the second quarter of 2011. Days sales outstanding in the third quarter of 2011 was 63 days as compared to 57 days in the second quarter of 2011 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. Inventory in the third quarter of 2011 was $215.7 million compared to $216.1 million in the second quarter 2011, with turns at 3.5 times, flat as compared to the second quarter of 2011. Effective October 28, 2011, Trimble’s Board of Directors has approved a $100-million stock repurchase program. This program supersedes the existing repurchase programs. The program does not require a purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is for revenue between $415 million and $420 million, with GAAP EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 to $0.49. The non-GAAP guidance excludes the amortization of intangibles of $29 million related to previous acquisitions and anticipated stock-based compensation expense of $8 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 9% to 11% tax rate, with 127 million shares outstanding and interest cost of $3 million. It should be noted in the year-over-year comparisons that earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 were favorably impacted by a non-GAAP tax credit of 14%, driven primarily by a catch-up on research and development tax credit that (inaudible) in the fourth quarter of 2010. Now, for your questions. We will take questions at this point.
Willa McManmon: Operator? Hello, operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Cox Piper Jaffray.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Thanks a lot. Congratulations on a great quarter, guys.
Rajat Bahri: Thanks.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: My first question is on the Mobile Solutions segment. How should we think about the step function in revenue? Is this largely a reflection of the PeopleNet acquisition and a run rate that we should model up of and is there any sort of seasonality to the PeopleNet business so it would be different than your traditional Mobile Solutions segment?
Rajat Bahri: So, Michael, this is Raj. There are three factors that are contributing to this growth rate. One is PeopleNet acquisition that you mentioned. Second is our base business excluding acquisition is also up double-digits versus prior year, and the third is actually an offset. As Steve mentioned, we are verticalizing our portfolio, focusing on high value-added solution, and we are pruning based where it doesn’t make sense. So, there’s an offset. Those are the three factors that are contributing to that 54% growth rate, two on the plus side, one on the negative side. And, going forward, we would expect the revenue – in our core business, we have lot of subs that are coming online that will continue to generate growth. PeopleNet is a very – is a growing business so their revenue should continue to grow into Q4 as well, and we will keep on pruning that base that we think is non-value added, but the net result is that we’ll continue to see strong double-digits growth rate into Q4, and then next year also we should have strong double-digit growth rate for Mobile Solutions with operating margins expanding quite a bit next year versus where we are. We had a 5% operating margin. We should be close to a double-digit operating margin next year with the revenue growing at double-digit, so we could see significant profitability next year in our Mobile Solutions segment.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay. That’s very helpful. On the rest of world side that 78% growth you noted, was there any particular segment that drove that growth and any particular regions within rest of the world to call out?
Rajat Bahri: Rest of the world has been strong throughout the last few months and really we’ve seen growth in E&C in Africa. Africa is continuing – we’d put a lot of focus in Africa earlier on. We are seeing good growth in Africa. We’re seeing good growth in South America, and Mid East Middle East is also growing for us. So, basically, all the regions are – South America and Africa, I would say, are driving the growth and we expect that to continue in the near future.
Steven Berglund: But, it will tend to be more – well, ag is getting a foothold in some of those regions as well but it’s primarily an E&C, construction-oriented show at this point in time. But, with the build-out of Mobile Solutions as well as, let’s call it, a number of new agricultural footholds – maybe not so much in the next 12 months but over the next two, three years, we’d expect them to start to put up some numbers in new regions around the world.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay. If I could, just one last qualitative comment – or question; if you could just compare and contrast what you’re seeing today on the E&C side of the business relative to where you were this time three years ago given the concern of investors trying to draw the parallel between the two?
Steven Berglund: So, when you say three years ago, we’re talking about post September 15th, 2008?
Michael Cox – Piper: Correct.
Jaffray: Correct.
Steven Berglund: So at this point in time, I don’t think – I may have to look at my watch today to make sure I’m being accurate here. But I don’t think there is a – I think the – let’s call it, the reaction of, let’s call it, exposure to euro concerns and all the rest of it. I don’t think it’s of the same magnitude as it was three years ago. As of three years ago, September 15, it was very much the same as September 11, 2001. There was an instant precipitous step function drop in demand where every – kind of three years ago, every CEO in the world I think went in on that Monday morning and said, I want to see all expenditure requests and oh by the way, I’m not approving any of them. I think it was a step function and it was precipitous. I would characterize the environment at the moment as being one where, okay, there is some more deliberation, people are scratching their heads and saying, okay, do I really want to put out the money? But ultimately, they’re still spending. So I would say that the two years do contrast with each other and this one is much less severe than it was three years ago. So it’s – yeah, it’s different. I’m not saying that it couldn’t end up being the same thing (inaudible) but I think it is a different environment today as compared to three years ago.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Thanks a lot.
Steven Berglund: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajit Pai Stifel Nicolaus.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah, good afternoon and congratulations on a very solid quarter.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: Couple of quick questions, I think the first one is just looking at Europe. Could you give us some qualitative comment on the growth that you saw in Europe, how much of that was acquisition, how much of that was organic? And then going into the fourth quarter, how do you expect that to be changing?
Steven Berglund: Well, let me make a general comment and then maybe Raj can speak to – of the numbers. So there was a significant organic component in the European growth in the quarter. Some of it was primarily the Tekla effect in the quarter. But I would say Europe is – breaks down into a number of different cases. We have got Mediterranean Europe obviously which is suffering and I’d, for the moment, include Ireland as part of Mediterranean Europe. Then you’ve got what I’d call Nordic and Germany which are actually still quite reasonable, quite strong. France is in between, U.K. is a little in between. So I’d say it all comes down to cases within Europe. But I would for the moment say we wouldn’t necessarily anticipate, based on recent news here, wouldn’t anticipate a change in the fourth quarter at least yet, but I think Nordic in particular is relatively strong and Germany is relatively strong and I wouldn’t necessarily expect that to change here in the short term the rest is so-so.
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, so Ajit, if you quantify that a little bit, as I said in my prepared remarks, Europe on a reported basis was up 35%, but that included the Tekla acquisition. If I exclude the Tekla acquisition, Europe was still up 22% and the countries that drove the growth were, Germany is continuing very strong for us; France, continuing very strong for us; Russia, very strong for us; Belgium, good for us. So – but the other countries have been kind of soft for a long time, so that didn’t hurt us, the Greece, the Spain, the Italy, so those countries have not been generating any growth for us for a long period of time. So, basically, Germany, France, Russia drove that growth for us.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. And then the second question is just looking at your stock buyback and cash generation and acquisitions, given the current sort of climate of fear and what’s happened with valuations in the end markets. Could you give us some color as to how you prioritize your uses of cash and whether the acquisition environment has become more attractive for you or less?
Steven Berglund: Okay. So, I would say in – our position has been pretty much unchanged for quite a while which is if we generate cash, the primary priority would be to use it within the business. So, I’d say if we could beneficially make an acquisition that would enhance the strategy of the company and ultimately create shareholder value. That’ll be the first priority. I think this environment – well, first of all, I think that the last year or two the acquisition environment has changed from the standpoint, there are more assets that have become available in the last 12 to 24 months than seemed to have been available before. So, whether it be private equity assets coming out of that form of ownership or longstanding family owners of businesses that have kind of resolved that – okay, there may not be a whole lot of value enhancement possibility over the next few years and therefore putting their assets on the market. I would say is that the availability of assets has probably changed in the last 12 to 24 months. Clearly, we’ve demonstrated some level of appetite for those. So I would say it is really no change from the fundamentals on our part and maybe a somewhat improved environment for gaining access to assets. So I would say is our profile will remain relatively unchanged when it comes to acquisitions.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: And then the last question is just looking at both the competitive environment and the potential disruption in the supply chain out of the flooding in Thailand, et cetera, have you seen any change in either your supply chain right now the impact from the floods, or any change in competitive dynamics in terms of pricing in your larger markets?
Steven Berglund: No. Don’t think so. I think if we’re going to be exposed to the Thai flooding from a supply chain, it’s going to be effects deep in the bill of materials. We haven’t been able to identify any, let’s call it, primary or even secondary suppliers that have been significantly affected. We may not have visibility yet. Anyway, there may be deeper in the bill of materials. There may be components or modules that may end up in short supply but thus far it either has had a minimal effect on us or will have a minimal effect on us or it is not yet seen. But so far, and we’ve asked the question, so far we seem to be coming through the Thai supply chain issue in reasonably good shape. And as a result I wouldn’t necessarily expect to see any (inaudible) through the competitive dynamics at least in the markets in which we participate.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. Thank you so much.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Great quarter guys. Can you hear me?
Steven Berglund: Thanks. Yeah.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Okay, just starting out with Tekla, can you talk a little bit about how the business performed relative to your expectations this quarter and just a broader demand environment for the BIM product?
Steven Berglund: Sure. So I think, the company – aside from the accounting nuances Raj spoke of, the company is performing very much as expected. They are a quality company. They have long – long before they knew us put emphasis on financial performance, so their margin structure is actually quite strong. And so far, I think that in terms of what they’ve been delivering from financial performance standpoint has been very much in line and as I said, we have been very much encouraged, let’s call it, on a collaborative strategic basis how quickly Tekla and the rest of Trimble have found each other and whether it be joint selling or concepts of collaborative products going forward and all of that I think has contributed to, let’s call it, a great deal of optimism over the next two, three years in terms of what can be accomplished by the combination. In terms of short term expectations, I think Tekla would one of the cases where – let’s call it, they are encountering a little bit more of the deliberative decision making. So, while still – while the word is still growth for them, I think maybe there’s been a little bit of, let’s call it, a more deliberative time consuming process involved with them. Many times they’re selling into large accounts and I think I’d call slower, not – the business isn’t disappearing, it’s just taking a bit longer to land. So I would say the fundamentals are still very positive. They are seeing some of that deliberative decision making but what we still see is a worldwide expansion and a growth environment for them. So, still very much consistent with what we expected to see when we made the acquisition. 
Rajat Bahri: And the other point I would make just to understand the underlying, we have reported $15 million of revenue and basically a slight loss but there’s $7 million revenue in profit that was just accounting in nature that will appear back in Q1. So if you put that numbers back Q1 is where you see strong double digit operating margins from Tekla.
Steven Berglund: So in reality I guess they are to some extent in the banks for next year, simply when the accounting comes back we’re going to get a bit of a step function from the accounting effects of Tekla.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Got it. Got it. And just in terms of the double-digit growth that you talk to with regards to the guidance, should we be thinking along the lines of your longer term growth targets and how much should we think about acquisitions contributing for next year?
Steven Berglund: Well, I think it’s too early to talk much about last year. It was October last year where we put the kind of, I guess, we used the words neighborhood of 20% growth down for 2011. Okay, we’re doing that. I think given the environment we’re going to be a little careful. I think certainly with what everything we can see and kind of the early target setting within the company, we’re certainly expecting double digit growth, but just how much of it. I think acquisitions of these – the partial-year effects (inaudible) full-year effects from some of these acquisitions will certainly kind of be gravy or frosting on the cake relative to next year. But I think discussions about next year are at least three months premature at this point. So we’ll see what’s happening with the overall economy but certainly Tekla is going to be one of the net-net contributors both legitimately and through the accounting effects next year.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Great, thank you.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Valera Needham & Co. LLC.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Thank you. In the Mobile Solutions group, I think you mentioned double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. I’m presuming that’s not just year-over-year since you’ve obviously got it quite easy compared with the acquisition. Can you clarify was that sequential or what did you mean by that double digit growth for TMS?
Rajat Bahri: As we gave numbers versus prior-year, right? We were up 54% versus prior-year. And we talked about growth – double digit growth rate versus the prior-year numbers in our prepared remarks, Rich.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Okay, what’s the prior-year number in the fourth quarter?
Rajat Bahri: No, this is third quarter versus third quarter of last year.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Yeah.
Rajat Bahri: That’s what we talked about in our comments. So we had a 54% growth versus last year.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Right. Okay.
Rajat Bahri: And we had double digit growth rate in our core business and we had PeopleNet contributed as well. And we’ll see the same phenomena in – and then we had to offset – consciously getting out of some businesses where we’re not making money. And then basically Q4 you will see the same phenomena. There will be a sequential increase also and also increase versus prior year as well.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Okay. That’s what I was trying to get at. So Q4, you are expecting a sequential revenue increase?
Rajat Bahri: We are. We are.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: And then you mentioned I think for next year you’re expecting I think strong double-digit growth but again I guess with the acquisitions clearly in the first half that would be sort of a layup. Is there any other way we can think of next year sort of adjusting for the acquisitions?
Rajat Bahri: Well, I think what you’re going to get just trying to characterize with situation in a form that gives you some comfort here. So I think that – there are a fair number of moving parts in the business at this point in time because we are pruning the portfolio, so I think we are no longer focusing on some aspects of the business that we inherited from that road. So there is going to be a let’s call it a decline on let’s call it the baseline. At the same time, even though we can’t necessarily talk about them openly, let’s just say that there’ve been a string of wins – contractual wins here recently that will generate growth next year and then okay, there is the net-net acquisition effect as well. But I think maybe there’ll be revenue growth but I think for next year, what the relative focus on our part is to demonstrate let’s call it that the financial model we can generate out of Mobile Solutions begins to converge on the rest of Trimble. So what we are looking for out of Mobile Solutions as a first priority next year is let’s call it a significantly better profit performance than we’ve been able to demonstrate this year. So I think that’s the first priority. There’ll be a net revenue increase but within that, there will be what’s call it a fairly significant shifting of the business away from one category kind of more horizontal businesses to vertical businesses which won’t reflect the long term in terms of growth potential but – yeah, so I think what you’ll see next year is, yeah, a larger revenue number driven by the acquisitions but then you’ll see organic growth on top of that. But the organic growth, there’ll be a plus and a minus together and it’ll be 2013 when I think that the, let’s call it, the full steady state business will emerge. So in the latter part of 2012 and into 2013 it’ll become much more of a revenue story, but next year I think it’s going to be more of a profit story than necessarily a revenue story.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: (Inaudible) nice to see the progress there. And one more, if I could, just on the Tekla revenue for the quarter, I think you said $15 million total revenue, Raj, can you say how that was split between E&C and Field Solutions?
Rajat Bahri: Sure. Just give me – start the next question, I’m looking up the numbers, we’ll give you the precise numbers. Just give me one minute.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Okay.
Rajat Bahri: Well, it’s probable – just on – in the rough terms, it’ll be kind of probably three-quarters E&C; one-quarter, Field Solutions, that’s probably kind of close enough (inaudible).
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Okay. And I just wanted to also clarify on the lost deferred revenue from Tekla. You said $7 million, was that just in the quarter or that was how much you expected to lose for the year?
Rajat Bahri: That’s just this quarter. In Q3, the numbers will be more like $5 million – Q4, it’ll be $5 million.
Richard Valera – Needham & Company: Okay. So that’s perfect. That’s what I thought. Okay. All right. Thanks very much, gentlemen.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tavis McCourt. Morgan Keegan.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. First, a clarification Raj, you did not include that $7 million back into non-GAAP earnings right?
Rajat Bahri: I did not. No, no. We take – and then we’ll recover it in Q1 of next year.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: I just want to make sure.
Rajat Bahri: Other companies do take it into account but we decided not to do it.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: Yeah.
Rajat Bahri: It’s much clearer from that perspective.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: I agree. And then can you tell us where the – when the PeopleNet acquisition closed in the quarter?
Rajat Bahri: It was the first part – early part of the quarter. So it was – I’m trying to think – it’s somewhere late July.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: Okay. So we at least got a solid two months of revenues from PeopleNet?
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: And then if I look at the cash flow statements and then back out the Tekla acquisition, it looks like about $180 million or so in acquisitions in the quarter. Was that all PeopleNet or were there other acquisitions in the quarter?
Rajat Bahri: Say that again. What was your question?
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: In the cash flow statement for acquisitions in the quarter.
Rajat Bahri: Yes. So we had PeopleNet. We had Tekla. Those were the majority of it but we had a couple of more. We had company called Ashtech and company called OmniSTAR that we paid for. I’m taking about the first nine months. But yeah, for the quarter, those were the two big ones, because the cash flow shows the first nine months. That $763 million in cash flow…
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: Yeah.
Rajat Bahri: ...you see that that’s for the first nine months of the quarter.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: No, I understand. I back out. I get a…
Rajat Bahri: Yeah. So for this quarter, those are the two big ones.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: Two big ones, okay.
Rajat Bahri: Yeah. Those are the big ones; there is nothing I can think of.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: And then Steve, kind of further in the commentary relative to 2008, I presume the channel inventory is in probably a pretty different state now versus 2008. But can you talk about that a little bit?
Steven Berglund: Yeah. I’m going to have to do this kind of – I’m not sure I’ve got – nor the access to a whole lot of data on the subject but let me give you my impression. So I think what happened in latter part of 2008 and early part of 2009, without a doubt there was what’s called the dealers bled off a whole lot of inventory in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. And my belief is that that never came back and this is a positive. This is demonstrating let’s call it improved operations and greater trust in Trimble to deliver. So I don’t think those inventories ever came back to close to what they were in the latter of 2008. So I think yeah contrasting the two environments, I suspect is that net dealer inventory in the channel is meaningfully less than it was in 2008. Again, I don’t have data specific to that but that would be my sense but I don’t think there is any inventory overhang in the channel at all. I think people learned their lessons back in 2008 and made sure that they never – that they implemented those lessons. So I don’t think there is any concern on our part about channel inventory at this point in time.
Tavis McCourt – Morgan Keegan: Got you. Thank a lot.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Goldberg Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jonathan Goldberg – Deutsche Bank: Hi.
Steven Berglund:
Hi.Jonathan Goldberg – Deutsche Bank: Thanks for taking my question. I had question – I wanted to ask about your operating expenses, your fixed costs, and whatnot. There are a few moving parts here. You’ve given a good amount of clarity on that related to the acquisitions. But, I wanted to get a sense for how you think you can continue to grow revenue without adding too much to OpEx, your organic OpEx please?
Steven Berglund: Yeah. So, I think the core concept in the company is really this concept we keep talking about of operating leverages. We run all the businesses in the company to this concept of operating leverage, which is okay, how much of our incremental revenue dollar are they dropping to the operating income line and the designated target for the whole company is 25%. That will vary from business to business. So, I think the rough formulation would be out of every dollar, with a 50% gross margin, they on average would put 25% back into either channel development, marketing and sales, or R&D; hopefully, not G&A. And so, I think that would be the longer-term expectation going forward. Now, what is happening, in large part because of the acquisitions, is the structure of the company is changing somewhat, is the growth margin is tending to increase as we get more and more software content into the company. And, as a result, the OpEx as a percentage of revenue is probably tending to be a bit higher, still aiming for the net result of 25% incremental on the operating line. But, it is a strong ethic within the company as to leverage revenue growth into the bottom-line and at the same time is also encouraging people to think about developing their businesses internationally and extending the product line. So, we’re attempting to find the right balance between building out the channel and expanding the product line. And so, the sub-concept to 25% operating leverage I think is the key concept that we use and that we would expect to be held accountable to.
Jonathan Goldberg – Deutsche Bank: And so that was – you think you’re on that run rate on an organic basis in the quarter?
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, if you take Tekla out, our operating leverage was 26%. So, our margins would have been 18.5% versus the 17.5% that was reported.
Jonathan Goldberg – Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Coster, JP Morgan.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Yes, thank you. Just a couple of quick ones, most of – have been answered. First, in terms of the SITECH distribution channel, where do we stand in terms of completing that transition state? And, in – looking at Tekla, I assumed throughout that a good part of the synergy here is taking the Tekla BIM products and going global with it. Where do we stand on that?
Steven Berglund: Sure. So, the SITECH still continue to be built out. Actually, for the moment, I forget the exact number but the total number that we are expecting to have is somewhere around the 105 or something when we’re completely built out. We are putting them in place at a fairly rapid rate. So, I would say that the expectation still by the end of the year is to have the SITECH network pretty much built out. There’ll be some gaps on the map. But, if you look at the map, it’s getting to be reasonably well covered, and then there’s an in-between category that will probably be the last to flip over to SITECH. There are actually nine Caterpillar dealerships that have been – sorry, Trimble dealers for a number of years that have not yet converted to SITECH but if you look at those already completed, plus those nine, we are 70-plus-percent complete at this point in time, and by the end of the year, we should be substantially complete. So, I think that it’s getting pretty close to – we’re going to have a steady state model here, I think, around the end of the year with a little bit of additional build-out yet to come, but by the end of the year, it will be substantially complete. As far as the Tekla synergies, yeah, you’re right; we are – synergy is a word we tend to be relatively suspicious of in Trimble, but here is a case where we think we have a strong synergistic combination where Tekla brings, first of all, a strong platform that we can build on. We can build other product functionality on top of the Tekla platform, which would be our intent, but then they bring structures. We have mechanical, electrical, plumbing with Accubid and QuickPen. We have what’s called emerging generation smart tools. We have Meridian which was an acquisition from six or seven years ago, which is focused on scheduling. So, against the elements of what is called BIM 5D which is the three physical dimensions plus schedule, plus cost, we have large parts of the solution. So, I think there is strong synergy from a product standpoint; right now, it exists. We, over the next year, will make it more elegant. But, I think – as you point out, I think the ability to project ourselves worldwide has just gone up by a step function. What Tekla brings into the mix is already existing international distribution. They bring into the mix a strong direct sales force that is capable of making a key account sale to a major contractor for example. There is absolutely no reason why that was called impressive direct sales force when they go in to make a key account corporate sale, couldn’t bring along what’s called the other elements of Trimble along with them and essentially sell the entire package and then reverse goes as well. So, I think that the early leverage will come from the channel side, a later leverage to come from the product side.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: It is, though, a pretty high-touch sale I imagine, requiring a certain type of salesperson and I would imagine a fairly lengthy sale cycle.
Steven Berglund: Right.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Can you talk about that and how long it would take before you believe that international progression can really gain traction?
Steven Berglund: Well, I think the assumption is probably overall right then. When you’re selling into a major product – project it will take some time, and the runway is going to be relatively long in terms of complete a sale. At the same time, there is a high-degree of opportunism also loose in the world, and we have already seen cases where, let’s call it – we have had some success already on an international scale, doing what I described. So, I think, yeah, we won’t see the full effect for some period of time, but I think we are seeing positive effects now. And if nothing else, I think we – what we are seeing relative to the longer term as we are seeing much better access than we’ve had before. So, for example, taking Meridian the scheduling software – project management software would be more appropriate, we are seeing significant activity on their part in the Middle East now. So, we’re getting, let’s call it – already seeing leverage from, let’s call it, the geographic scope of Trimble and that’s just being one example. So, I don’t want to overdo this but I think that the story will emerge but it doesn’t – it’s not – here’s the case where I’m not saying it’s a year off; I’m saying it’ll be progressive and we’re seeing effects right now.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Thank you.
Rajat Bahri: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten, Longbow Research.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: That was close. Good afternoon, everyone. Hello?
Rajat Bahri: Hi, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Yeah. I just need some clarification; could, one – could you break out how much acquisition was in the Mobile Solutions versus – looks like it’s about $15 million, $16 million of acquisitions which (inaudible).
Rajat Bahri: We don’t break acquisitions out by segment as Tekla is the one we’re doing it because of substantial and part of the purchase price. As I said, acquisition was a big part of the growth and than a big business.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Yes. You said Mobile was up double digit, which would – we put it in the low 40s and the difference between that is the acquisitions. Is that a fair way of characterizing it?
Rajat Bahri: No. We’ve never – we never go there, so – 
Steven Berglund: But, Eli, I think you’d be correct in attributing a large part of the step function growth to the acquisition, but there are a lot of moving parts and we don’t want to get into trying to describe the point.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Well, the point is that’s going to continue for the next four quarters, at least.
Steven Berglund: Yeah.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Is it fair?
Steven Berglund: Yeah. It will.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: That’s sort of what I’m trying to drive at. The profit – it looks like if you strip out Tekla from E&C, that the Engineering – the E&C business profitability was off a little bit from last year, but probably pretty close to what we’ve been seeing. Is that what we’re expecting that the profitability will hold there for...?
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, the E&C business is – if you look at Q2, it was in the 20s. We were fairly close to 20% if you (inaudible) Tekla out of the business as well. So we should see that level of profitability continue for E&C business.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: And we’re expecting seasonality in Trimble Field Solutions, it will be a little weaker in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, is that fair? Is that what’s holding your forecast down?
Steven Berglund: Yeah, so I mean again maybe less so than we were but we are still a reasonably seasonal business and fourth quarter will tend to be down for Construction, and it won’t be until late in the quarter that we start to see the uptick on Ag. So I think, yeah, what you said is correct.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Got you. And the tax rate, which is running around 10%, is that going to continue next year or would it go back up a little bit?
Rajat Bahri: I think that for prudence, I think we should probably – we’ll give more guidance when we give the full year guidance. But at this point, I think 13% to 15% is where we should start with next year.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: I’m sorry?
Rajat Bahri: 13% to 15%.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: 13% to 15% for tax rate next year, so still the same number. And can you just real quick – can you give me the breakdown of sales by geographic region because I sort of missed it? I know that you said Europe was 34% and North America was 51%. I wasn’t quite sure.
Rajat Bahri: Sure, sure, sure. North America we – 51% of the revenue came from North America; 24% from Europe; 15% from Asia-Pacific; and 10% from rest of the world.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: All right. Thank you very much.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Jeff Rath, Canaccord Adams.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Adams: Hey guys, just getting in under the wire. Steve, I wondered if you can talk about the general demand trends and how you’re thinking about 2012 for Ag? I know you don’t guide but there’s been a lot of volatility in commodity prices recently and sort of schizophrenic in some degree. How are you thinking about the tone of agriculture as you look out into sort of macro indicators? And then, Raj, I was just – I had a tax-related question. Thanks.
Steven Berglund: Yeah, so I think – first of all, I think the comp next year for Ag 2012 versus 2011 is just going to be generally difficult. So I think that’s actually my – contemplating the business that’s my – probably my first in point of consideration. I think, yeah, there is volatility in commodity prices, but at the same time, as long as it stays within certain bounds I don’t see it as really being a factor for us. Again, we’re selling productivity to farmers. We have an – range that contributes the same thing. So unless there’s a, let’s call it, a meaning – let’s call it, a significant degeneration of commodity prices that make farmers feel significantly less well off than they are at this point in time, I don’t think it’s going to be a real factor for us. Again, my theory on Ag when it comes to commodity prices is that there is some sort of threshold value or if they are at or above that threshold value we’re fine. But we – beyond that threshold value a 20% or a 30% increase in commodity prices won’t affect us simply because farmers are going to make the right decision as long as they feel enabled. And I think that threshold value of commodity prices gives them that enablement. So at this point in time I don’t think kind of the macros are of particular concern to us per se. I think we’ve looked to floods, we’ve looked to droughts, we’ve looked to those sorts of things as being equally – of equal importance to us. So I don’t want to be – here but at the moment I don’t think we’re particularly concerned with the macros one way or the other.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Adams: And then just last one Raj on tax rates. Again, I don’t want to pin you down too much. But is there any reason to think that we shouldn’t be kind of in the same tax rate range sort of 9% to 11% as we think about mix in 2012?
Rajat Bahri: You know, a safe assumption at this point is 13% to 15% as I mentioned. It’s very possible we may be lower but at this point we are finalizing the plans. We don’t know where exactly the profits are going to come from, which country, which part of the world. So I’m not comfortable going to 9% to 11% at this point.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Adams: Okay, thank you very much.
Steven Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: And sir, you have no further questions at this time.
Steven Berglund: Okay, thank you. Talk to you all next quarter. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Christine and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Willa McManmon, Director of Investor Relations. Ma’am, you may begin your conference.
Willa McManmon: Thank you, good afternoon. Before we begin I’d like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today’s call and the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to number of factors detailed in the company’s Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to our press release, the press release and additional financial statements are posted on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the table to our press release. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on the web and by phone as detailed in the press release. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund: Good afternoon. The second quarter was the first feel good quarter Trimble has had in three years. Feel good signifies an outlook that strengthened during the course of the quarter, a growing sense of confidence about medium term prospects across the company’s businesses and the sense that our financial model is firming up. In particular, the combination of the E&C and Field Solutions segments which represent 84% of total revenue grew 27% and left the quarter with strengthening momentum. Our view, of course, represents strut contrast to current concerns about the macroeconomic environment, while acknowledging the possibility of an economic rocky road, our snapshot view on 2011 revenue as of today is above our original outlook for the year with a further upwards adjustment for the effect of the Tekla Acquisition. E&C segment revenue grew 26% year-to-year with strong operating leverage. The improvement also reflected the change in Nuance with less reliance on heavy and highway business. Although we saw continuing strength in heavy and highway in the quarter, we also saw modest improvements as well as improving confidence and surveying instruments and those businesses serving the building construction market. While commercial and residential construction remains in deep recession in the US and most parts of Europe, levels of activity appeared to have recovered from the bottom. These trends offset slower growth in China, there was a function of both government efforts to cool the economy as well as the recent problems specific to railway construction which has been a major Trimble focus.
 : Ignoring short term transaction accounting effects, we anticipate Tekla will operate at or above Trimble’s overall revenue growth and operating margin targets. The field solution segment improved 30% year-to-year and reflected contributions from both agriculture and GIS. The agricultural performance was driven by continued strength in the agricultural economy around the world as well as an expanded product range. GIS although still negatively impacted by budgetary constraints of the state and local level, reflects the effects of new products and the early results of greater focus on vertical markets. The recent acquisition of OmniSTAR’s signal corrections business which is currently most heavily supporting agriculture is making an early meaningful contribution to profitability and has deepened our recurring service solutions portfolio for existing markets and more to follow beyond agriculture. Advanced devices reflected relatively different results in the quarter primarily due to a short term drop in our timing product sales to largely telecommunications infrastructure projects and the loss generated by ThingMagic, which was acquired in late 2010. We expected recovery and tiny revenue during the second half of the year, and also expect the significant gross margin improvement in ThingMagic as it begins to utilize Trimble’s manufacturing capabilities in the third quarter and has RFID capability has to be incorporated in products across the company. Although, the operating profit of the mobile solution segment net expectations, we do not establish a trend, a bottom line improvement partly because of deferred revenue affects. Our strategy to create consistent segment with growth and profitability is focused on establishing strong vertical solutions much as we’ve already done in construction supply which has consistently generated both revenue growth and double digit operating margins in a difficult market. Beyond construction supply our identified vertical markets in the segment are first three transportation logistics, communications, environmental field services and trade and public safety. We are focusing on two specific constraints to profitability in the segment, one is the communications vertical, which is primarily focused on large enterprise customers and telecommunications and adjacent markets and the other is the legacy on focused Fleet Management Solutions. Our solutions in the communications vertical will be to add additional value and capabilities, such as diagnostics and RFID based solutions allowing us to increase monthly revenue. The course on fleet management issue will require more cost effective distribution modem which is being implemented. Overall, we expect mobile solution segment profitability by year-end and believe we have a sober plan to achieve double digit operating margins in the medium term. We are in the process of adding another key element to our transportation logistics vertical strategy, but the recent announcement of the acquisition of PeopleNet. PeopleNet represents an example of the enhanced value add that can be provided in specific vertical markets as it provides an extensive solution beyond basic track and trade capability, which includes tools to manage a complex regulatory environment, fuel costs and driver safety. Trimble can further enable PeopleNet by tapping into our technology base to further extend capabilities and provide more customer value. PeopleNet complemented the earlier acquisitions of European based Punch Telematix and the Indian based Tata Automotive Mobility Technologies and in combination creates a worldwide player. PeopleNet brings the financial track record that is already consistent with Trimble’s revenue growth and operating margin performance, but the expectation that our combined capabilities should allow us to enhance it’s already strong performance. In summary, we believe we are on track and are meeting our stated financial targets for the entire – the overall economy does represent a potential challenge to this view if it works. At the same time any kind of revival in the commercial or residential construction market or an improvement on our sober forecast for mobile solution could create an upside. As of today, we continue to expect record year with strong Five new products and new applications carrying to 2012. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri: Good afternoon, as usual I’ll cover the non-GAAP numbers in my prepared remarks today. Our GAAP numbers as well as the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is available in today’s earnings press release. I’m pleased to say this quarter was a record quarter for Trimble in terms of revenue, gross margins, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. Revenue for the second quarter 2011 was $407.2 million up approximately 22% as compared to the second quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP gross margins were 53.4% versus 50.9% in the second quarter of 2010, due to high level of subscriptions services and software sales. Non-GAAP operating income of $80.3 million was up 30% as compared to the second quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7% compared to 18.5% in the second quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we dropped 25.3% of incremental revenue to their bottom line. Non-GAAP net income of $75.2 million for the second quarter of 2011 was up 46% as compared to the second quarter of 2010. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2011 were $0.60 as compared to diluted non-GAAP of earning per share of $0.42 in the second quarter of 2010. Our tax rate was 10% versus 16% in the year ago quarter due to geographical mix of revenue and timing of early tax credits. Looking now at segments, second quarter 2011 E&C revenue was $236.7 million up 26% as compared to the second quarter of 2010, with growth in all regions and particular strength in North America and Europe. Non-GAAP E&C operating income was $49.4 million or 20.9% of revenue as compared to $35.8 million or 19% of revenue in the second quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP operating margins was up due to higher revenue and product mix. Second quarter 2011 field solutions revenue was $104 million up 30% as compared to the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to very strong sales of agricultural products. Non-GAAP operating income was $43.1 million or 41.4% of revenue as compared to $29.5 million or 36.7% of revenue in the second quarter of 2010. The increase in non-GAAP operating margin was again due to higher revenue and product mix. Second quarter 2011 mobile solutions revenue was $40.2 million up 5% as compared to the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to acquisitions partially offset by the previously announced loss of a major customer in the second quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP operating loss in mobile solution was $1.9 million or negative 4.7% of revenue as compared to a profit of $0.5 million or 1.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2010. The decline in non-GAAP operating margin was due to mix of hardware and subscription services revenue and the impact of acquisitions as well as the loss of large customer in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 advanced devices revenue was $26.3 million down 1% as compared to the second quarter of 2010 due to continued slower sales of timing products partially offset by acquisition. Non-GAAP operating income in advanced devices were $3.3 million or 12.5% of revenue as compared to $5.6 million or 21.2% of revenue in the second quarter of 2010. The decline in non-GAAP operating margin was due to lower revenue and product mix and the impact of acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2011, 50% of revenue came from North America, 25% from Europe, 16% from Asia Pacific and 9% from the rest of the world. The year-over-year growth raise by regions was 14% in North America, 9% in Asia Pacific, 43% in Europe and 47% in the rest of the world. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2011 were $137 million or 33.6% of revenue compared to 32.4% in the second quarter of 2010. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is due to acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange. Second quarter 2011 non-GAAP non operating income was $3.5 million versus $296,000 in the second quarter of 2010 due to increased (Scott) CTCT joint venture profitability and impact of foreign exchange. We finished the second quarter of 2011 with $249.8 million in cash compared to $244.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. We used $57.5 million for business acquisitions, cash flow from operations in the quarter was $82.8 million. Accounts receivable for the second quarter of 2011 was $257.2 million as compared to $265.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. Day sales outstanding in the second quarter of 2011 was 57 days as compared to 63 days in the first quarter of 2011. Inventory in the second quarter of 2011 was $216.1 million compared to $203 million in the first quarter of 2011 with terms at approximately 3.5 times compared to 3.7 times in the first quarter of 2011. Turning now to our guidance for the third quarter of 2011, Trimble expects revenue between $406 and $411 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.22 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.50. Non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of 2011 excludes the amortization of intangibles of $25 million related to previous acquisitions. The anticipated impact of stock based compensation expense of $8 million and anticipated transaction costs of $6 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume 11% to 13% tax rate and 1.7 million shares outstanding and interest costs of $3 million. Please note the above guidance includes the result of the recently closed Tekla acquisition. Excluding Tekla, the company’s revenue is expected to grow in the range of 22% to 23% in the third quarter. In addition Tekla is expected to be diluted to Trimble’s earnings per share like $0.02 in third quarter of 2011 and $0.02 in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a result of a one time non cash write off on a portion of Tekla’s existing deferred revenue. Trimble expects the Tekla acquisition to be accretive to it’s projected 2012 non-GAAP earnings about $0.08 to $0.10 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2012. In the second quarter, we also announced a credit facility of $1.1 billion of which we expect to have roughly $630 million drawn as of the end of the third quarter primarily to fund the Tekla acquisition which closed at the beginning of the third quarter to the enterprise value of $442 million and our preexisting debt of $125 million. Now, we will take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Hi guys, can you hear me?
Steven W. Berglund: Yes.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Great quarter and I think what’s on everybody’s mind right now is, you know, what’s giving you the confidence right now, just giving with the macro situation is that, it seems like your outlook is bit brighter and your thinking has actually improved, can you maybe give us some detail around what’s happening there that’s giving you that confidence?
Steven W. Berglund: Well, I can only comment on what we see, I’m not in a position to comment on the macro economics probably bad for others but certainly in the last year-to-date, but particularly in the last quarter, what we’ve seen in the majority of our markets is, let’s say an improving environment where and obviously in general sense of improving confidence, that’s not to say that it is anything like the market that we saw on 2007 or maybe even the earlier part of 2008, it still very much of truncated market from what it was in those days, so we are not back to that level of robustness. But, I think the prime at least prior to September 15th, 2008 was that, this is the company that has a potential to grow even in relatively recessionary conditions, I think the precipitous nature of the drop in 2008 challenged that assumption. But in general, we’re not commenting on views on the macro economy, I think what we are commenting on is the markets as we see them today and one month and to the third quarter, what you are getting is our view in our markets today and with no larger intelligence involved.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Can you maybe comment a little bit around the mobile solutions division, it looks like there is some challenges in the margins again, and you know, we were looking for a little bit higher margins just based on, the more subscription revenue coming in to the hardware sales last quarter, can you just maybe talk about that dynamic and when you actually expect the operating margins from mobile to start picking up and some of the confidence around that?
Steven W. Berglund: As I said in the scripted remarks as we expect to be profitable by year-end, so I will let Raj make the comment on secularities in the particular quarter, but again, I think that we have a plan to be profitable in the segment by the end of the year and I think that we have, what I would consider to be a credible view on double digit operating margins in the medium terms, let’s call within the next 12 to 18 months.
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, in particular to this quarter, you know, even take a little bit more time to have profitability to come, if you look at deferred revenue it’s drawing, part of it is we have some enterprise deals that we announced in mobile solutions and we have driven – we are delivering a lot of increased functionality as part of the deal and although we’re shipping stuff, we cannot recognize revenue because we haven’t delivered all the functionality that we need to deliver and that all that delivered by Q4 and that will enable us to recognize the revenue ongoing on new subscriptions and also do a little bit of a catch up. So, to be honest, it maybe frustrating but we didn’t see the progress but I believe is that, you know, we will be up profitable in this segment by Q4.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Got it. Just one last one of Europe, that looked to be particularly strong there. I just wanted to see, what was the source of that growth and maybe what that look like on an organic basis? Thanks.
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, so, in Europe we saw a very strong growth in agriculture, you know, better than the (inaudible) that you saw 30% so very high growth in Agriculture in Europe. Our E&C business also grew at pretty strong double digits in lot of countries like Germany, France and we saw strong double digit growth and there is a bit of an acquisition impact there too, we did announce a couple of acquisitions in Europe as well. So, a strong double digit growth I would say, you know, we saw 44% growth, I would say somewhere in the 25% to 30% growth organic in the rest was acquisitions.
Operator: Your next question is from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Thanks, good afternoon. On the geographic front, you talked about, I guess, Europe being you know, sort of quite strong and I guess perhaps surprisingly strong. I’m wondering if you could, just comment on how you think you’re doing that in the face of what are some obvious economic challenges over there. I’m guessing a lot of it has to do with Europe products, products like increasing penetration perhaps. Could you just comment on that side of it? And then, in China, Steve, I just was hoping you could review what you said about that, you know, first you know, maybe you could give a sense of the magnitude of your China business, I know, you don’t break that up but it’s been a pretty big, you know, I think topic with investors in the stock. And then, what do you see as the dynamics in China, you mentioned it was slowing down, but I’m wondering if that’s still growing at a nice rate relative to the rest of the business?
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. So, first of all, Europe is very much of a next big, you really need to talk country by country, there really is no overall deal on Europe. So, I think that agriculture, I think stands alone in Europe and skews the results fairly heavily. So, I think that we’re doing well everywhere in agriculture at this point in time including Europe and I think that’s the one business that kind of transcends Europe. When it comes to construction, I think that you know, through the Mediterranean up to Ireland and still the UK is pretty weak. Nordic and Germany and generally France are relatively okay when it comes to construction. So, I think it’s just a blended story for Europe. But very Mexican generally weak and uncertain is still the environment in Europe. As far as China, a large part of what Trimble has been selling into China today has been focused on railroads, a lot of it being high speed rail. But generally, ministry of rail related activity. And so, I think there are two things that are occurring there. So, I think there is a general desire in the government to slow things down a little bit. So, that’s cooled the economy a bit. And then, I think more specifically tough is that the – both the relatively recent scandals in China about the ministry of rail and most recently the accident and questions as to how the railroads in China are being financed has caused, what’s called a slowdown there. Now our view on China, short and medium term is to a large extent unchanged. I think that there for a couple of years, we saw, let’s call it red hot growth, you know, bubble type growth in China and we took advantage of it. I think that China is maybe moderating to let’s call the more reasonable growth rate. And so, I think that it is our second largest country after the US. We are still talking about growth in China or just simply not talking about maybe kind of the bubble styled growth that we have been seeing but got meaningful double digit growth in China is probably what we can expect steady state for the next several years. So, still strong markets to a very attractive market is just not maybe being filled by kind of, some of the speculative excess that maybe we’ve seen in the last few years. So, still a positive story, still a growth story, maybe just not quite at the same levels as before.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Great. And Steve, given the recentness of the train crash, what gives you the confidence that you’ve actually seen the full impact of any slowdown related to that?
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, I think, well, I think to the recent crash is maybe, got the interest of the international press. But, I think if you look at what’s been happening inside China for the last three to six months anyway, there has been, let’s call a bit of a retreat on the relative confidence that Chinese have had in the rail system. So, I think this simply made it more evident to a worldwide audience. But, I think in reality, things have been going on in China that have not been really noticed by outsiders for the last three to six months. So, I don’t know that the event of the last week or so is actually going to really change anything all that much. But, I think this has been really a six month sort of phenomenon in China and significant personnel changes and significant Nuance within the ministry of rail. So, yeah, this might intensify but I think that is, this is just a continuation of the series of issues in ministry of rail in China.
Rich Valera – Needham & Company: Great, thanks for that Steve.
Operator: Your next question is from Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a very nice quarter.
Steven W. Berglund: Thank you.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: My first question is on the gross margin strength in the quarter. We called out higher concentration of software and subscription. Is there also a function here of mix towards field solutions and I guess, this number north of 51%, is that something that we can look for going forward as well?
Rajat Bahri: Yes, so, both our E&C segment and field solutions both expanded margins versus prior year. And obviously this has been part of our strategy and we’ve talked about you know, the company has increasingly focused on software type of products and subscription type of products and you know, that strategy continues to be a big part of our strategy going forward. So, yes, I mean, I think you know, we should look at you know, over 12 months rolling average expansion in gross margins as we move forward.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay. That’s encouraging. And then on the tax rate, any thoughts on where that will settle out in the back half of the year back to the mid teens level or?
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, so, I think we think of the back half in the range of 11% to 13%.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay, okay. I think that does it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from Tavis Mccourt with Morgan, Keegan.
Tavis Mccourt – Morgan Keegan: Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the internal growth broadly in the quarter or by sector, it seems like it picked up a bit, would be my guess, but it’s hard to tell exactly. And then secondly, Raj, you mentioned $630 million number on the drawdown, the credit line you expect for Q3, what should be we anticipating after that, would you expect to de-lever that or are you still looking to make acquisitions with that credit line and does any kind of decrease in your stock price like we’ve seen make you think about stock buybacks versus acquisitions, any kind of commentary you can have about your strategy around that would be great? Thanks.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. Let me start generally and maybe Raj can add better intelligence. So, I think that, in terms of internal organic growth I think, we thought overdoing it here, yes we did better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter and that left was basically better prospects from within the company. So, I think that contrasting it is to general views on the economy at this point in time is, what we did see was, let’s call a more confident environment within the company relative to our internal growth prospects, most heavily cross E&C and certainly field solutions. So, I think that at this moment in time the organization feels better about the growth prospects going into the second half of the year, then it really has in a few years. Now the economy may come back and buy us on that in the second half, but right now this organization is actually talking more aggressively about internal organic growth and it has for sometime. Now some of that is actually, not just the market and maybe the markets are performing little bit better, but some of this actually relates to strategy. The strategy verticalization, which we are pursuing across the company, not just in mobile solutions, I think it’s beginning to have some effects. So, for example, in railroads for example which is, right now being reported in the E&C segment, we have created the business in and around railroads, now there maybe multiple as than more than 5, Trimble division selling to railroads at any point in time. And this is more than just China, this is around the world, but what we have organized as a business unit around railroads, we have organized one around electrical utilities and one around waste. And so, what we are doing is we’re getting better access, better insight and hopefully better penetration into some of these industries, when we have in the past, so during the trade of economic slowdown, we had to go slower on this, because at some point, because of the realities of cost control but with a somewhat that more robust environment we’re now pursuing these more aggressively and I think we’re actually beginning to see the impact of that simply better focus and more attentions some of these markets I think are adding some to the growth. The growth rates at this point in time, so I think that, yes the markets maybe somewhat better then there were, but I think some of this was actually strategy playing out and actually, where we’re actually able to more forcefully act then we were a year or two or three ago. Relative to the debt in terms of general aspirations I think that we’ve announced number of deals this year, OmniSTAR, Tekla, PeopleNet and others. And I think that our primary focus at this point is to continue with the first priority of investing in the business and then secondly if we do have excess cash, I think we’ve shown the willingness and desire to return that to the shareholders through stock buybacks, we would not intent to cumulate the stock. But I don’t think it’s an automatic proposition that we’re de-leveraging story at least not yet, that maybe – that may happen but right now I think that we’re looking to take advantage of the opportunities out there in the business as the first priority.
Tavis Mccourt – Morgan Keegan: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Your next question is from Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Goldberg – Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, I have similar question for both of you, but I’m kind of looking for two perspectives. And what I want to understand better is, as revenue grows, as happy days are here again, hopefully, can you grow revenue, assuming no macro problems right. Can you grow revenue without having to grow expenses at a faster clip? And Steve like, you’re sort of qualitative, big picture answer and then Raj I would also like better understanding from you about how that plays out in the quarter, trying to pull out some of the puts and takes of Tekla and how that works into the model?
Steve W. Berglund: All right, well, yeah, so I think if you look at Trimble’s track record for the last 10 to 12 years is fundamentally, you take out the puts and takes of special circumstances such as acquisitions, but the fundamental proposition of this company and our relative focus on talking about operating leverage really is, the focus on growing revenue faster than the cost based, that’s how we’ve expanded margins overtime. So, I think it is fundamental to the company. I think the relative number of acquisitions over the last 12 to 18 months, it has confused that baseline a little bit simply because what we are doing at this point in time, we brought a number of acquisitions with relatively high gross margins but also relatively high expense loads now, which in some sense is to start at the baseline, but there the proposition is that if we have the business, that has a high gross margin overtime with pie focus on operating leverage we will work the expenses down into a typically they are lot generate 20% to 30% operating margins on that. So, I think as a matter of principle at least overtime is that absolutely the principles to grow revenue faster than accounts base. Now, one other special circumstance just to point out an example where we have not really over the last year or so been – where we actually had to consciously spend more money then what I’d call the underlying study state baseline could be for example, on the SITECH build up – building up on internal channel. So we’ve had a groups of people going around and essentially establishing in SITECH that’s a cast that won’t be there at sometime in future when the channels built up. But the other is since we are moving into a number of white space areas, whether it be parts of South America, whether it be India, whether it be China is there is a initial load of putting in the support structure to support these new SITECH, okay so we are in both cases standing in advance of revenues. So, right now, there are a number of moving parts here but fundamentally the principle is yes, absolutely a tenant of this company which is to grow revenue faster than we are growing in the cost base.
Rajat Bahri: Jonathan just to get into your specific quarters, if you look at our Q2, we dropped 25% of the incremental revenue to the bottom line. So our margin is expanded because of that. It is expanded 120 basis points of margins in Q2. Now looking at Q3 just to get specific around that in our guidance includes Tekla revenue and we said without Tekla our Q3 revenue would be up in the 22% to 23% range and Tekla adds more revenue on top hill, excluding Tekla that revenue range would have been in the $387 to $392 million range which is you know around 22% growth rate this prior year and again we expect to drop 25% on that incremental revenue to the bottom line. Now the Tekla acquisition is adding revenue but at this time it is not adding profit because we had to write on top all the maintenance revenue, they pick up maintenance revenue in the beginning of the year and then they amortize during their full year, but the US gap will say that you pick up an acquisition you write that off. So, we are not picking up $5 million of revenue in profit in our numbers in Q3 and Q4 that will come back to us in Q1, so you just need to get into excluding Tekla, we are delivering our basic model delivering our basic module and Tekla took over the deferred revenue haircut, we are not picking up any profitability for the first two quarters. But next quarter – Q1 we’ll get you know, great margin in Tekla because that revenue, the maintenance revenue, the contracts get renewed every year and we’ll start picking up that extra revenues starting in Q1 of next year. So, in other words, the guidance of $0.48 to $0.50 that includes a dilution that Tekla is providing our base businesses a couple of pennies higher than that.
Jonathan Goldberg – Deutsche Bank: Got, it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Ajit Pai with Stifel Nicolaus.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good afternoon and congratulations on a very solid quarter.
Steven W. Berglund: Thank you.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: So, a couple of quick questions. I think, the first is on the mobile solutions side, over the past in our several years that business has been highly fragmented business. And recently, they have been – with the transactions that you have had recently, it appears that our relative market share in the business is becoming material. Could you give us some color as to what the at the end of the year your relative market share is likely to be on a global level and how many other players are sort of close to you in terms of, about relative scale?
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. Well in terms of market share, I think it’s – market share would require I think a long dissertation because as you pointed out that the market is so fragmented. So I think we need to really dissect it kind of vertical market by vertical market. I think that they are on many applications, that have a black box on a vehicle. But we are attempting to move away from that. So I think it really comes down to individual market segment by market segment is the only way to talk about it. Now characterizing the competitive situation in general, I think let’s call it falls into three, maybe four different categories here in general. I mean, again, I’m generalizing too much here, but I think, there is (Qualcomm) and their upcoming tracks operation which represents, call it the big revenue base up there. And then, I think – then Trimble fits into let’s call it a second category here where revenue in the general space is measured in the hundreds of millions, and okay. There are few – if maybe any others in that category then there are a number of probably companies that are doing $40 million to $60 million, to $70 million a year in the space. And then, the other category is garage shops where a number of individuals are working out are working on and perhaps literally a garage somewhere writing code. Now, I think that what we have found and what we are continually finding is that the competitive round falls out in terms of who is most credible in a five year context, what company, what competitor has got, a good solution to-date, but what competitors really going to be there in five years. And, in kind of the old IBM mantra of nobody gets fired for picking up IBM. So, I think that plays to our benefit in the long-term, because we’re accompanying with balance sheet. We’re a company with credibility. We are a company with brand. And I think we can leverage that particularly when we move beyond kind of the trick, track and trace, dot on a map, level of functionality and you start to integrate more closely with the enterprise. So, I’m going to dodge the question on market share, just because I think that it’s too complicated, but I think the competitor dynamics at this point in time, given the competitive field are looking pretty good for us over the next few years.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: And some of the improvement in profitability in that segment that you’ve talked about is, most of that is going to come from operating leverage of increasing revenues, or some of that also going to be coming from, you know, some further streamlining of cost?
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, I think, well, I think it’s both, I think that, as I identified, I think some of this is just managing the portfolio. Most of the elements are mobile solutions portfolio are actually profitable, or if they’re not technically profitable at this point in time, how it have fundamental structure of profitability. The gross margins are at the right place. The cost structure is at the right place, or they maybe suffering, you know, kind of short-term issues, but we have a high degree confidence by making them profitable. We got a couple of the issues in the portfolio where we have to take action, one is what I called is large space, which is enterprise level, customers which is tended to be a bit too close to track and trace, sort of capability dot on the map functionality and so the value stream is rich enough so I think we’re focusing on that and getting the monthly ARPU up on that and the others kind of the, at road historical legacy of, what’s called bit kind of horizontal applications and I think there it’s, yeah, both the growth factor, but I think we also have to look into the cost, cost rationalization in terms of what is the cost per acquisition, what is the cost of maintaining a customer in that. So, I think it’s a little bit of both, Andy.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then the last question is just looking at both your agribusiness and your E&P business and emerging market outside of China. Are there any trends over there that you’re seeing that are material in terms of, you know, accelerated penetration that you expect in the next, you know, of growth over the there, over the next 18 months or is that also sort of showing similar signs in China?
Rajat Bahri: No, I think China is actually – well, China tends to be unique in this regard because it ramps so hot and now they’re – it’s cooling fast, it’s a change in, if you will contrast from today versus a couple of years ago. But I think general, we got to discount large parts of the Middle East at this point in time for obvious reasons. But, I think, India is still a small market for us, but we’re getting good traction in India. We’re seeing potentially very strong growth over the next five years in India. That’s mostly E&C we’re – given scale of Indian agriculture, it is not yet a market that we’re willing to put on the effort, we’re trying to figure that one out in terms of what technology can we bring to Indian agriculture at its current scale and we got some ideas, but it’s not officially on the list of emerging markets for us now. I think, Africa is turning out to be a major opportunity for us, not the easiest market to access, but there’s a lot of development going on in Africa. And I think, we’re dealing Africa as a legitimate growth market in its own right and I’m kind of talking (inaudible) sort of thing. So, I think the Africa is, if anything picking at this point in time and then I think through the parts, let’s call stable parts of the Mid East, yeah, maybe Dubai is not the market it was a few years ago, but at the same time that Middle East is strong market. South America, I think is a market both Brazil, Chile, sometimes Argentina are all markets where we see significant growth and we’ve increased our physical presence in Brazil to pursue that growth. So, I think in general, the emerging markets are not sharing kind of this floor view of China, which I think special circumstances. So we’re actually quite positive about the prospects in the emerging markets.
Ajit Pai – Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Good afternoon, everyone.
Steven W. Berglund: Hi Eli.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: I come on a little late, forgive me, if I’m repeating something. But, first, I’d like to, just make sure I understand the quarter, which is the guidance that we got a while ago. Your revenue came in, we were 127, I guess, your guide was 291 to 397 how much of that, is there any acquisitions in that number, any acquisition revenue in the difference.
Steven W. Berglund: No, lot of it was organic, you know, we had anticipated in most of our acquisitions, because our big acquisitions Tekla is in Q3.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: And so there was no any material acquisitions in that quarter that was strictly organically beat, correct?
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, are you talking about the beat or versus what do you mean, yeah our expectations on the organic side led us to the beat the number significantly.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Now the non-GAAP number the 60 versus, you know multiple in the 50 the 10% tax rate added about $0.03 and I’m I right it was a $5.6 million gain in the foreign currency about $0.04.
Steven W. Berglund: No, we are excluding that gain, from a non-GAAP numbers.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: I am sorry.
Steven W. Berglund: We are excluding that gain from our numbers but $0.60 does not include the gain, we had a gain because we hedged, we put a forward contract on the Tekla acquisition price, and there was a gain on that forward contract, we are excluding that when we calculate our non-GAAP EPS. Yeah, but if you include that our non-GAAP EPS would be $0.64 to $0.65.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Yeah, that would be in the GAAP number wouldn’t it?
Steven W. Berglund: It is in the GAAP number, you were asking about $0.60 it’s not in the $0.60.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Yeah, but it would be in the GAAP number. So the difference between you cited a tax benefits, the rest of it were just because of the higher sales.
Steven W. Berglund: Higher sales better margins.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Yeah a bit improvement. Now, you have now stepped up your amortization it was 13, no it was 16 to 13 in the quarter and you have given us guidance of $25 million that’s your run rate?
Steven W. Berglund: That’s because we used the Tekla acquisition in Q3 that grows, you know a acquisition of $440 million and that comes with goodwill and intangibles. So, the major reason we stepped up from Q2 to Q3 on intangibles is because of the Tekla acquisition.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: And that will stay there for a while?
Steven W. Berglund: That will stay there for a while yeah these intangibles grow for seven years.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Now, the implication of your volume increase 22 to 23 versus, you know the guidance that you gave us is only about $18 million to $20 million for Tekla, is it a seasonally weak quarter, I know Tekla have any profits, but Tekla I thing $84 million last year in sales so I’m just trying to gather.
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, you know I think you again missed the part of the call, I talked about how we cannot recognize, we have to write off there deferred revenue when we buy then, so right now we are forecasting $19 million of revenue and if we had recognized $5 million of that deferred maintenance revenue which is 100% margin, we would be at a $24 million to $25 million run rate times four that’s $100 million.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Okay, so and that would be the ongoing rate that will be –
Steven W. Berglund: Ongoing rate would be higher than $100 million because we will expect some growth next year.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Yeah, okay. And you said there is no impact, this first quarter and you said there is a benefit in the first quarter is a $0.08 to $0.10 benefit next year from Tekla or charging of?
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, there is a $0.08 to $0.10 EPS benefit next year and Tekla starting in Q1 of 2012.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Okay, we know that. Now what’s going on in the base E&C business, it looks like you had profitability improving demand, it’s pretty strengthened, is there any change in order pattern as well as we got into the summer time?
Steven W. Berglund: No, I mean aside from what we call traditional seasonality, there is nothing order unique going on at this point in time, I think there is just a sense that, you know, things are returning to what I call a more normal pattern for the first time really since the end of the third quarter 2008.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Okay, and as far as the foreign side of mobile that’s going on, I feel we should – we are still looking at that the market, it looks like we are destroying, has it been any slow down in that market from normal seasonal basis or is that some strength continued this year?
Steven W. Berglund: You are talking about field?
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: Yeah.
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, again normal strength everywhere, really is the story.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: So, but usually your seasonality be most of the gains in the first half from the agricultural side, is that correct?
Steven W. Berglund: Yeah, we are expecting to see the same kind of seasonality as always there, I think the second quarter looked the strong as it did simply because of secular growth, I don’t think they really seasonal effects that explained that, so I think we’re just seeing strong secular growth there.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Securities: All right. Thank you very much.
Steven W. Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question is from Jeff Rath with Canaccord Genuity.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Genuity: Just one question and then one clarifying question, follow up. One of, Steve if you could isolate the SITECH expansion and speak to that a little bit, where is it today? How many dealers, how, I don’t know if it’s penetrated, but how complete is that rollout, when do you think that will be complete? So, if you could give us some context around that and maybe even how that’s contributing to revenues sort of separate contribution. And the, Raj, in your scripted marks, my follow up is, you talked about your revenue breakdowns by geography and you also talked about the incremental growth rates in those geographies, I wonder if you could repeat that for me, I was – I think I missed a few of those numbers, so Steve and Raj, thanks.
Steven W. Berglund: Okay. So, first of all relative to SITECH, so we are expecting when that settles, when it does settles is that there will be roughly plus or minus a little bit a 100 SITECH around the world. We expect to be substantially complete with that build up by the end of this calendar year. So, in the next six months we should be, you know, close to that number we won’t necessarily be at that number but we should be close to that number by the end of the year. Right, at this point in time, we are over half done, let’s say, literally dozens of being relatively close to completion, so it’s typically and this adds a little bit of last minute suspense that seems straight things out. So, we are over half done, we expect to substantially completed by year-end, it’s hard that, it’s hard unless it’s a Greenfield sort of territories, it’s hard to pull out exactly what is relating to SITECH activity and what’s not, but I think that when we first established the concept we were talking about a 2-3 plus points to the company, points from the SITECH based on what we can see at this point in time, that’s probably pretty consistent with where we being to end up. So, we are seeing a net effect, can’t necessarily quantify with precision simply because a lot of this is anecdote. So, we are certainly getting all the stuff better, better insight as to what the market is doing because of the association of the SITECH. We are I think getting the benefit of having one brand that stands for technology in the distribution channel over the worldwide basis. So, we are actually in some cases when it comes to accessories, branding accessories SITECH and creating a bit of a brand there, so I think we are starting to see the signs of leverage. It is still early days but I think we get – we think the full effect starting next year kind of by definition once we are fully build out. So, I think early the signs are encouraging, we are definitely getting a revenue lift from it and I think we are building what’s called more brand equity in the marketplace simply by being able to support one distribution brand worldwide. So, next year well, I think be the true test.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Genuity: Raj, if you could speak to the day segmented gross rates, thanks.
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, so I’m trying to dig it up Jeff, as we speak. It’s from memory North America was up around 40%, Europe was up around 43%, Asia-Pacific was up around 9% and rest of the world was up in the 46%, 47%.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Genuity: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2009 earnings. My name is Sarah and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the event over to Ms. Willa McManmon, Director of Investor Relations. 
Willa McManmon: Thank you, good afternoon. I am here today with Steve Berglund, our President and CEO and Raj Bahri our CFO. Before we begin I would like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call and the subsequent Q&A period, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to number of factors, including the competitive nature of the market place, the condition of the worldwide economy and other factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  During this call, we will refer to press release, the press release and additional financial statements are posted on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the table to our press release.  Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve: Good afternoon. The fourth quarter reflected continuing recovery albeit in an environment that remains comparatively uncertain and volatile relative to our historical experience. Our revenue is slightly above expectation and our operating leverage in converting net revenue to operating income was good. While acknowledging the ambiguities and dangers around us, Trimble's outlook remains in the same cautiously optimistic realm we provided in October.  Although we have yet to produce persuasive financial results demonstrating this improving outlook, we did see the first year-to-year revenue and operating earnings increased in five quarters and can reaffirm our anticipation of double digit revenue growth for 2010 with a disproportionately positive effect on earnings. The conditions in the engineering and construction segment were difficult throughout 2009 but we're more manageable during the second half of the year. In addition to greater stability we are beginning to see some signs of improving demand in some regions and in some product areas, most particularly in survey instruments and construction machine control which both provided meaningful double digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter over prior year levels.  This improvement is occurring without much identifiable impact from the U.S. stimulus package or much decisive improvement in business confidence in North America or Europe. If either of these should appear we could see a faster acceleration later in 2010. The U.S. and European commercial and residential markets remain difficult at this point with no real expectation of a lift in the first half of 2010. Other international markets remain generally positive with an emphasis on China which continues to be a source of strength. Against the easily identifiable points for being negative about the E&C segment; let me specify some of the reasons for believing we can grow the segment this year.  While these factors will all provide a lift, it is relatively hard to quantify the extent of that lift very precisely because of the larger uncertainties at work in the economy. But first is the fact that we are supplying productivity solutions for the E&C market and operate somewhat independently from the machine utilization metrics that determine new machine sales. As the market picks up we have the ability to sell on to existing equipment fleets and not wait for the revival of new machine sales.  We also believe the adoption rate of our technology will accelerate on any recovery because of structural changes that have occurred within the industry as a result of the severe recession. The only likely survivors of the consolidation that has occurred among contractors and service providers will be those who have improved their productivity through the use of technology.  As recovery occurs in the scale of work increases we expect the percentage of machines utilizing our technology will likely be significantly higher post recession than prerecession. The second factor that argues for some optimism is that some level of [haunt up] demand has built up in some product categories. For example, we are in the third year of lower expectations in our survey instruments business.  While it was rational for survey firms to hold off on expenditures and period of reduced project work. When the project work begins to pickup many of these firms will find that they have sat out one or two product generations which have offered significant productivity improvements. As they become more confident about the future prospects they will have a need to engage in some catch up investment.  Our third factor is the structural benefit we will receive from the SITECH distribution channel development. While we have been hampered by the simultaneity of the Caterpillar joint venture announcement in October 2008 and economic meltdown momentum continues to build distribution capability more available to Trimble during 2010.  Our fourth factor is the availability of new product categories during 2010. For example, we expect the first products from the virtual site solutions venture during 2010 which will stimulate sales activity in the second half of the year. In other example of new product introduction is the release of a complete suite of new survey products for Spectra Precision and Nikon brands at the INTERGEO trade show. These products have been very well received to the point where our initial constraint was manufacturing ramp-up not market demand.  A fifth factor may be the arrival of U.S. stimulus effect in the second half of the year. While we have been relatively dismissive of the effects so far it is likely that any money that was released in early 2009 based planning and regulatory process lead times of 18 to 24 months.  Under that high processes the net effects might begin to show up in the second half of 2010. The sixth factor is the still relatively healthy dynamics in E&C markets outside of North America and Europe.  Africa is becoming a legitimate growth market for us and is providing very strong percentage growth and China remains very strong. The attractiveness of our technology in emerging economies was demonstrated by our first Trimble Dimensions user's conference in China in December. We had over 2100 registrants at that event and the first outing matching the attendance of the fourth Trimble Dimensions held in Las Vegas in early 2009.  While recognizing that still weakened and volatile state of the economy, we continue to believe the E&C segment can grow at a meaningful rate in 2010. Any revenue increase coupled with the cost cutting already taken will allow earnings grow significantly faster than revenue.  As expected the field solution segment reflected a small decline in agricultural fourth quarter revenue year-to-year which offset a small increase in GIS revenue. The slower agriculture market has resulted from tighter credit conditions in markets such as Brazil, weather conditions in some countries and reaction of farmers to the general economic uncertainties.  Despite the slower than anticipated demand in the market our view continues to be the 2009 represented more of a resetting of the agricultural technology market after bubble years in 2007 and 2008 then a change in the fundamental long term technology adoption trend line. We expect a new equilibrium to be established in 2010 and we expect to grow agriculture sales in 2010 at a rate consistent with a long term double digit trend line although this effect may not be reflected in first quarter results due to the still difficult year-to-year comparison. The mobile solution segment, continue to build the momentum which will lead to stronger 2010 financials. Beyond the deals already announced a number of relatively significant deals have been signed but not announced or relatively late stage in the selection process. Activity in small fleets and work forces continues to be a challenge for us as smaller operators await a turn in economy and renewed business confidence. We continue to expect the Force re-initiative we launched in the second half last year to beneficially impact financial results in the second half of this year. For the last several quarters we have discussed our efforts to reduce turn in the mobile solution segment and its potential to have a meaningful effect on both reported revenue and profitability.  We established a downward sloping trend and overall turn throughout 2009 that should have a positive impact into 2010 results. These efforts would have produced even more dramatic positive effects if they had not been partially offset by economic or industry conditions which have created hardship conditions for number of customers and forced them to shutdown significant portions of their fleet. We expect this economic induced turn to continue throughout this year and expect that it may create some volatility in what is an overall positive trend. Taking together we believe these market and operational initiatives will allow us to demonstrate meaningful revenue and profit growth in the mobile solution segment in 2010. Companywide the fourth quarter provided more evidence that we have passed through an inflection point and we can be more focused on opportunities rather than mitigation efforts. The view express last quarter remains valid. In general we expect the E&C segment to demonstrate the earliest return to better year-over-year comparisons led by heavy and highway and survey instruments. While expecting growth from Field Solutions for the entire year in 2010, the comparisons to prior year will remain relatively difficult in the first quarter and we expect the biggest year on year moves to take price in the second through the fourth quarters.  Mobile Solutions will show a steady progression during 2010 has backlog is converted recurring revenue after the installation process is complete. Almost all Trimble businesses are planning for meaningful recovery in 2010, although the statement needs to be qualified by still on certain external environment.  Without any new economic shocks and with only modest improvements in the economy we could continue to expect total company double digit revenue growth in 2010, but this significant earnings progression based on a 35% to 40% operating leverage. The planning environment remains complex with both individual businesses and regions at different points and the recovery process and with the probability of continued higher than normal volatility.  Overall our focus remains unchanged restoring our financial model improving our competitive position and reinforcing the sources of short and long term growth. We are hopeful of returning to the more businesses usual environment in 2010. Let me turn the call over to Raj.

Raj Bahri: Good afternoon. Today we announced revenue of $277.5 million for the fourth quarter up approximately 4% from revenue of $268.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. This reverses the negative growth trend of the last four quarters and we expect to post improving growth trends over the next few quarters.  I’m going to cover non-GAAP numbers in my prepared remarks, our GAAP numbers as well as a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is available in the press release we issued today. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income of $33.8 million was up 18% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating margin was 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This reflected the fact that we dropped 54% of the incremental revenue to the bottom line. Both non-GAAP operating margins and gross margins were significantly up versus the fourth quarter of 2008 but we are down sequentially versus the third quarter of 2009, due to impact of foreign exchange rate, increased investment in our virtual side joint venture, investment in our user conference in China and product mix in Advanced Devices segment. We expect non-GAAP and operating margin to sequentially increase in the first quarter of 2010.  Non-GAAP net income of $25.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 was down 13% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $0.21 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income and EPS were down year-over-year due to the fact that tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 27% compared to a tax benefit of 48% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The 2008 tax benefit came from our R&D credit and geographical mix. For the full year 2009 Trimble's revenue was $1.13 billion down approximately 15% from revenue of $1.33 billion in 2008. Full year non-GAAP operating income of $172.1 million was down 32% as compared to 2008. Full year 2009 non-GAAP operating margin was 15.3% in 2009 as compared to 19% in 2008. We were able to achieve a 15.3% margin because of significant cost reduction efforts during the year. Non-GAAP net income for $126.5 million for the full year 2009 was down 34% as compared to 2008. Non-GAAP earnings per share of 2009 was $1.04 as compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 in 2008. In spite of the fact that net income was down 34%, our cash flow from operations for the full year 2009 was $194.6 million, higher than $176.1 million in 2008. I will now cover the results by segment. Fourth quarter 2009 E&C revenue was $154.3 million, up approximately 8% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, largely due to the stronger sales of both survey instruments and machine control products. E&C revenue for the full year 2009 was $578.6 million, down approximately 22% as compared to 2008 due to recessionary conditions concentrated in the U.S. and Europe. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter 2009 was $17.5 million or 11.3% of revenue as compared to $3.9 million or 2.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008. The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to year-over-year cost reductions as a result of restructuring in the segment as well as increased revenue. Non-GAAP operating income for the full year 2009 was $64.6 million or 11.2% of revenue as compared to $130.7 million or 17.6% of revenue for the full year 2008. The decline in non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to lower revenue. Fourth quarter 2009 field solutions revenue was $57.2 million, down 2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Field solutions full year 2000 revenue was $291.8 million down 3% as compared to 2008 in spite of a difficult comp in 2008 when Field Solutions achieved a year-over-year growth rate of 50%.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $16.2 million or 28.3% of revenue as compared to $17.7 million or 30.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in non-GAAP operating margin was due to slightly lower revenue. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $105.6 million or 36.2% of revenue as compared to $110.3 million or 36.7% of revenue in 2008.  We were able to maintain very high margin in this segment throughout the year. Fourth quarter 2009 Mobile Solutions revenue was $38 million down approximately 5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to the churn among smaller accounts that were impacted by the economic environment throughout the year. For the full year 2009 Mobile Solutions revenue was $154.9 million down approximately 7% as compared to 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of ready mix products for constructions.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income in Mobile Solutions was $5.2 million or 13.7% of revenue as compared to $4.5 million or 11.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to cost reductions. For the full year 2009 non-GAAP operating income in Mobile Solutions was $18.6 million or 12% of revenue as compared to $16.1 million or 9.6% of revenue in 2008. Improvements in the non-GAAP operating margins are primarily due to improving operational efficiencies.  Fourth quarter 2009 Advanced Devices revenue was $28.1 million up approximately 3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Full year 2009 advanced devices revenue was $101 million down approximately 16% as compared to 2008 due to reduced sales of embedded and aerial survey products.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income and advance devices was $4.1 million or 14.7% of revenue as compared to $6.7 million or 24.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 lowered due to product mix. For the full year 2009 non-GAAP operating income in advanced devices was $18.8 million or 18.6% of revenue as compared to $25.8 million or 21.6% of revenue in 2008. The reduction in non-GAAP operating margins was due primarily due to reduced revenue and product mix. Moving on to the full company by geography in the fourth quarter, 50% of the revenue came from North America, 23% from Europe, 19% from Asia-Pacific and 8% from rest of the world.  This reflects the decline of 7% in North America, growth of 3% in Europe, growth of 40% in Asia-Pacific and growth of 15% in the rest of the world. By geography in full year 2009, 54% of the revenue came from North America, 23% from Europe, 17% from Asia-Pacific and 6% from rest of the world.  This reflects the decline of 15% in North America a decline of 21% in Europe, growth of 2% in Asia-Pacific and a decline of 26% in the rest of the world. Total company non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 came in at $104.2 million compared to $100.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 a 4% increase driven by a weaker dollar, acquisitions and a significant investment in our China dimension user conference partially offset by $7 million of savings from cost reductions. For the full year, non-GAAP operating expenses were $406.7 million compared to $424.3 million in 2008 down 4% and partially offset by 6 acquisitions in 2009. For the full year cost reductions led to approximately $25 million in savings. Non operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 6000 versus a loss of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to an increase in other income partially offset by lower profitability from joint ventures. We finished the fourth quarter of 2009 with $273.8 million in cash compared to $215.1 million in the third quarter of 2009 we generated $55.5 million of cash flow from operations for the quarter and $194.6 million for the year. We now have $151.5 million debt basically flat for the third quarter of 2009, we did not make any acquisitions or repurchase any stock in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter net accounts receivable was $202.3 million down only slightly from $202.5 million in the third quarter of 2009. Day sales outstanding was 66 days down 3 days versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Inventory was $144 million compare to $160.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. Turnover 3.4 times compared to 3.3 times in the third quarter of 2009. Deferred revenue of $84.6 million was up $16.9 million from the beginning of 2009. Turning to our first quarter guidance we expect revenue between $308 and $313 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.21 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.32.  Non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of 2010 exclude the amortization of intangibles of $14 million related to previous acquisitions and the anticipated impact to stock based compensation expense $4.9 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share assume a 27% to 29% tax rate and $123.5 million shares outstanding. With that I turn the call over for your questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JP Morgan.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Yes, thank you. Steve actually I’d like to just ask about the SITECH business. How material is that to your E&C business and when you talk of momentum, can you just kind of give us a sense of what it is that you are seeing out of it and how it will contribute in the future?
Steve Berglund: Okay, we consider it strategically very significant and from the very beginning when we announced this in October 2008 at that time we said that it would this in combination with the joint venture activity but the combined lift at the time we said it should lift the total company’s growth rate not the segment but the company’s growth rate by 2 percentage points a year.  We believe it still has that capability, it’s a little bit more of a confused environment now then it was then in terms of establishing that base line but we still believe that can add a couple of growth points to the company's overall growth rate. So, we consider it to be significant now without a doubt is for the last 15, 16 months both the Caterpillar principals and the Trimble dealers who need to come together to make this all happen and they have been dealing with really a meltdown of an economy and that has really pushed new distribution concepts to the sidelines while they focused on meeting the challenges of the environment. I think where now everybody is starting to see this increased ability, starting to see the road to an upside and so I think that the level of reengagement is occurring. So I can say that its current level of activity we have literally dozens of deals underway at this point in time.  We won't necessarily predict when they are all going to come to closure but let's just say a significant portion of the character [world] and the significant portion of the Trimble world are currently engaged and so we would expect that as we get deeper into 2010 that will begin to sound more confident and more descriptive of what that initiative putting on the top-line and by implication on the bottom-line.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan: Okay regarding the Mobile Resource Management segment, Sprint and AT&T are coming out with more sort of business oriented solutions through handsets. I realized they are less sophisticated than yours but do you sense that some of the churn might be smaller companies being picked off by that small kind of commodity line solution?
Steve Berglund: There is always a little bit of that going on the background, so let's call a smaller operator is only concerned about dot on a map level functionality, I'll take the example of a taxi fleet where in reality they want the simplest dispatch capability in kind of dark dot on the map functionality. Our honestly we are not the right solution there and we are not targeting that particular kind of market place.  So if all the customers wants is dot on the map functionality, we're not going to be targeting that market and okay, if we get an order, fine. So maybe in terms of the smaller accounts that probably is in the background some realization on the part of smaller operators that maybe they overbought and that they can get by with a simpler solution.  I think overall we're seeing it and I think the evidence supports the fact that approaching that as a customer service problem, our customer support problem is the right way that in reality the best bulk of our customers really do want and need the more advanced capability that we're bringing them and that what we did was kind of an inherit an inadequate customer service model when be buy that road and its taking some time to fix it. But I think the progress we're seeing is really that of approaching it as a customer support problem, much more customer intimacy, much more dialogue with the customers.  We can in reality see every unit out there and understand whether it's being used or not. If it's not being used, we have now put in place the procedures to call that customer and say why isn’t it, being used. Can we provide more training? Can we provide more systems to make it more productive for you? So I think it is there but in reality we're looking for companies and organizations that need a front end for their enterprise level solution and those are the ones we're pursing, not necessarily those that can easily be met by what I'm calling a dot on the map functionality.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan: My last question. Raj number of our companies are expressing the view there is suppressed cost that needs to be sort of addressed coming out of our '09 401k contributions, salary hikes, etcetera. If this is true of Trimble and what implications if there are any are there few OpEx going through the year?
Raj Bahri: Yes. So at this point we had salaries frozen for the last year. And we are going to watch the environment and reflect what the environment tells us if we think strong growth we may do some, we may restore some of the salary increases going forward but the environment doesn’t improve. So we will watch it on a daily basis. And depending upon the environment we will react but as Steve mentioned our intention is to grow the revenue double digits and no matter what we did on that front disproportionate amount of that will fall to the bottom line and we quantify that as 35% or 40% of incremental revenue we are targeting to fall to the bottom line in 2010. 
Steve Berglund: And I think maybe part of your point here Paul is that a lot of companies cut back on four way contributions as such, we didn’t do any of that we can approach things in its base. So we are not actually under any pressure to restore anything because we didn’t actually cut anything back in that category. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Good afternoon, everyone. 
Steve Berglund: Hi, Eli. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Just a couple of questions, one can you give me some insight on what's happened in the E&C profitability. We started to see some recovery in the second and third quarter. We had volume levels reported were actually reasonable. But we just saw a bigger step down in profitability that I might have expected in the quarter. Can you give me some insights of what of happened, is that mix or is that?
Raj Bahri: Yeah, couple of things happened and this is all kind of forecasted in our numbers. These are not surprises. We had increased joint venture investment we talk about that. This joint venture we talked about the virtual side, the level of investment, the level of R&D is ramping up fairly quickly, that was a significant increase from Q3 to Q4 and we also had this user conference that Steve mentioned in China which we spent in some money which we think will be a very prudent investment in terms of sales going forward and we did that and there was a little bit of mix seasonally Q4 mix tends to be little bit down versus Q3 mix. So there is nothing structured here Eli. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: $15 million number and may be $20 million odd number with those to fact as account to that difference?
Raj Bahri: I am sorry.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: I see a $15.5 million number instead of a $20 million odd number, as the GAAP issue I am looking at.
Raj Bahri: Yeah I would say the investment is $2 to $3 million, China dimensions is another $1 million so that bridges the GAAP for you?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: I am sorry you said the.
Raj Bahri: The joint venture investment is $2 to $3 million incremental, the China dimension were $1 million. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Is the joint venture investment continuing in 2010 for most of the year?
Raj Bahri: Well the way it structurally works is we get some reimbursement from Caterpillar so it will not impact us significantly in Q1 and the China dimension is clearly one time so we expect the anti-margins to recover in the teams again in Q1 of 2010.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: And should get better the rest of the year the joint venture you said you would get some reimbursement in the first quarter both for 2010, is the relative level investment in 2010 to JV materially higher than 2009?
Raj Bahri: Not materially high, I would say maybe they need to do higher than Q, EPS impact from 2009 to 2010 maybe we have a one to two penny impact negative effect.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: You made the comments about the Ag business and Field solutions will be a little bit slow in the first quarter but you still expecting double digit gains for the year. I guess my question you know, are you seeing that in the pipeline you are hearing it because most of the surveys of farm spending in 2010 are lower than 2009 across the board particularly North America your own place itself is Brazil at this point.
Steve Berglund: Yeah so acknowledging the point you are making Eli and that’s may be why we are being a bit cautious here but overall we see Ag producing a good year in 2010 albeit that the environment is may be more uncertain, feels more uncertain than it would have a year ago for couple reasons one we actually don’t believe that we are hard correlated to the new machine sales is that we are selling cost reduction, we are selling productivity, we are selling yield improvement and as result we think that okay, in a non penetrated market we can break this linkage to the new machine sales.  The other thing is that over the last year we have significantly increased the breadth of the product line within Ag adding these new capabilities more information intensive products so we actually have more to sell than we did a year ago and therefore we think that this sorts of factors should allow us to show again kind of return to what I call the long term trend line of selling technology in the agriculture.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: And with that we should be able to hold the profitability levels at this point if not approve of them. 
Steve Berglund: Yeah there is nothing we can see that would knock us off kind of historical profitability levels with some there are no forces that work that would really change the in hand profitability of this business.
Operator:  Next question comes from the line of Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel : Good afternoon could you give some color, I think you talked about not doing too many acquisitions right now. Could you give us some colors to what the pipeline looks like and which areas we are focused on?
Steve Berglund: Yeah, so I think that, Raj mentioned that we do not do an acquisition in the fourth quarter, I don’t think that indicates anything one way or the other in terms of our intent. Again at any one point in time we are out looking to see how we might enhance our strategic position either reinforcing our market beach head or filling in longer term technology or product gaps and if the answer is buy versus make in a sense or develop internally, we are interested and seeing what we might do.  Again not saying that there couldn’t be an exception to this rule but in general our style of acquisition has been relatively small companies, relatively small expenditures to establish those sorts of things, they are on that many large opportunities out there that would be strategically coherent.  So, that is what we are generally expecting. I think in general as we made four acquisitions in agriculture over the course of 2009 more or less, I think I wouldn’t be anticipating anything significant in agriculture anytime soon. I think the areas where if we were to do any kind of acquisition and would tend to be in the E&C space or the MRM space in attempting to accomplish those strategic ends.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel : Got it, and in terms of competitor dynamics, have you seen a change in the pricing behavior or any aggressive behavior from any of the competitors?
Steve Berglund: I’m not going to deny that in the back alleys and in the corner cases that this environment creates fairly tough pricing actions. But it tends to be circumstantial and situational and often times is occurring at the dealer level not necessarily as matter of corporate strategy. So as far as I know that we haven’t really touched our list prices in the last 18 months, at least in any sort of systematic way. And so I think that our view is that the overall placing structure has remained pretty constant although in individual cases there may be a better way a better but that will going on. So, right now we don’t see anything that I would call systematic and long-term.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel : Then when you look at the Mobile Solutions business, the second half of last year this was the business that you are getting increasingly optimistic on and expecting a ramp and a drop in churn etcetera. In the past few, at least the last quarter were you disappointed with this business or was it tracking as per your expectations in the middle of last year.
Steve Berglund: Yeah so I think early to mid last year we were probably a bit more optimistic on the timing of things. I think we were quite optimistic at the beginning of 2009 and in reality I think a couple of the facts slowed it down or impeded that a bit in general people became more cautious and more deliberate and so things moved out in time so the pipeline in those cases didn’t really change and there were a handful of anecdotes of companies calling and saying we really want to do this but we have just laid off the department that was going to implement it for us and so we will get back to you in 2010. So without a doubt the recession did impact the relative profile of what we originally expected for 2009. I think and maybe in a bit more of a muted fashion I am saying kind of the same things about 2010 because we're seeing the pipeline is long. We're seeing a lot of opportunities. We're seeing a lot of sizable opportunities and when I say sizable I'm talking 500 to 1000 up to income cases more than 10,000 units as opposed to 10s and 20s and 50s. Those have kind of largely disappeared and so I think we're confident about both the pipeline growing but then we're also feeling pretty good about the competitive dynamics here.  We're not attempting to, when we are in a competitive situation we're not tending to lose is the wider, the Trimble brand name is beginning to stand for more and more in this market and we're not tending to lose. So the business that is out there, we are tending to progressively get a better and better handle on competitively as well. So we're still optimistic about 2010 but without a doubt 2009 didn’t turn out exactly as we would have forecasted it at the beginning of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.
Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray: Hey, this is Alex Potter actually for Mike Cox. Just a follow-up here on the Mobile Solutions segment. The profitability in the segment got a nice bump here with that with double digits, 11% that we in the quarter. Is that a decent run rate going forward looking ahead here into 2010?
Steve Berglund: Yeah, I think we continue to view this in the longer-term emphatically as a 20% plus operating margin business but the amount of recurring revenue builds that pulse with it inherently larger gross margins. And so the profitability of this business if it's successful at the top line should bring with it higher and higher operating margins and we assess we're the steady status when we get to 20% but we still continue to see this is a 20% business at steady state the numbers should yield that sort of result.  So today I would say yes that we believe that we have achieved double digit operating margins status in this business and expect with some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. This will tend to be a more volatile business than other Trimble businesses but on a six month or nine months rolling basis this should we believe we are now into the double digit status pretty structurally and we expect it to go up from there. 
Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Great, you also called out survey instruments here is the driver of E&C sales was just wondering if you would consider this to be a leading indicator of I guess future demand for a broader set of products within that market?
Steve Berglund: Yeah, if you would ask me that question two years ago I would have instantly and emphatically said yes. In this environment I am drawn to be a little bit more careful about what I say is simply because things, this is a little bit more of abnormal market than anything we have ever seen before in terms of what's what. But I think in general I would say so but with a degree of cautions we are taking this quarter-by-quarter but it's encouraging to see a lift in survey instruments the outlook is actually pretty good. Now these are dismal levels a year ago or even two years ago.  So we saw a couple of years though hard times in survey instruments so we are working of a significantly lower base than say the 2006, 2007 sorts of number. But I would say yes the lift is encouraging and historically I would say that survey instruments have been a leading indicator.
Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray: One last question here in the E&C segment, just if you could comment on inventory in the channel has there been any improvement or things are pretty low? 
Steve Berglund: I would say again my sense is that things are still historically low and from an operational standpoint I would hope that they stay low I would hope that one of the things the dealers have learned during the last 16-17 months is that Trimble's delivery reliability is good enough as that they don’t mean to necessarily maintain the safety inventories that they might have had historically. So I guess what I am saying is that I am not necessarily expecting an inventory work for Trimble and I think if we don’t see it, that will be a good thing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Corey Tobin with William Blair & Company.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: A couple of quick ones, let's start with the mobile solutions, Steve I am just trying to go one level further on your comments regarding the outlook for this business in 2010 based on what you are seeing in the pipeline based upon your comments earlier, is this the business that we should expect to see grow higher than the corporate average here in 2010?
Steve Berglund: Really hard question to answer just because there are so many moving parts, because under one scenario it might be one things and on a different scenario it might be another, I would say it certainly the capability from what we can see here earlier in the year has that capability to grow faster but a delay of a couple of large contracts later in the year could change all that so I would say is from a strictly pipelined standpoint and from a straight up view earlier in the year, I would say that our general expectations that yeah it could grow faster than the corporate average we are counting on things like this forestry product really kicking in and it still continuous to be doing well.  And the combined effects of all these things in general would lead to my saying yes to that question but at the same time its construction actually does start to kick in as the year goes on is E&C itself could be a surprised. But just, everything I am saying is highly qualified at this point of time because I don’t think the crystal ball is all that clear relative the full year at this point.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Okay, so we move in the relative nature of the question if we look just the mobile solutions segment 2010 could be here the way its lining up right now pipeline imply that this could be the break out year in terms of growth for the segment is that a fair way to look at it?
Steve Berglund: That’s a fair way to look at it but I won't repeat that but the qualifications do need to be considered.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Okay two others if I could shifting to Ag and the margins in that point would you say given the dynamics here and given again expected return to growth in that segment that the 27% or so operating margin we saw this quarter should be the low point as we go forward?
Raj Bahri: Yeah I mean if you look at the full year you should really look at the full year because it is a seasonal business in Q1 tends to be by far the biggest quarter and you could see close to 40% margins in Q1 so on average I think we averaged to on a non-GAAP operating basis we average 36.2% margins for the full year and we expect it to continue into next year for the full year basis.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Okay great final one if I could Steve as we sit here today relative to last time, you had a call in October or maybe November, whenever it was. Are your confidence level and the double digit growth here put 2010 higher or lower based on what you have learned since then?
Steve Berglund: Well, overall my confidence about 2010 would be that’s grow marginally higher in January than it was in October, so we are on the right trend line. It's just we are seeing, again there is more volatility out there than we have ever seen before as a company. So, I think this economy has not yet settled itself out. But I would say that in terms of since the cost for low point of January a year ago, there has been a steadily increasing level of confidence on my part that we got come to grips with this thing and okay my confidence would be higher today than it was in October.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Great, congratulations on the return to growth, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Yes, thank you. Your guidance for the first quarter implies quarter on quarter growth of about 12%, I think historically seasonally grow about 15% to 20% in the first quarter. What are some of the puts and takes so maybe making it little more cautious than you typically would be?
Raj Bahri: No, you are right about the seasonal impact, I think Ag business as I mentioned earlier is pretty much phenomena that happens in the back half of the quarter, I would say last four weeks of the quarter and so we are being a little bit cautious from that point of view.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Okay, the other elements.
Raj Bahri: For example of Q1 of last year was really a good year for Ag and in Q1 of ‘08 was a great year, we had 80% growth rate in Q1 of ’08. Q1 of ‘09 we had a 13% growth rate on top of that. So, to repeat a growth rate in Q1 2010, it depends really, so that’s where we are being a little bit cautious there.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: On gross margin you are down a little bit sequentially in December should we expect gross margins to kind of toss back to that 52 plus or minus range that historically has been in the first quarter?
Raj Bahri: Yeah I mean if you look at again I will talk more here, on the yearly basis we did 51.4% margins for the full year of 2009 and we expect that to improve going into next year.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: And then finally one of your competitors reported the results that recently a Japanese competitor in E&C seems to be losing some momentum in their business, may be you can talk a moment about the competitive dynamics in the E&C and how may be the slowdown is kind of reconfiguring where your competition looks like?
Steve Berglund: Yeah I don’t want to overdo this but I think that when we entered the slowdown and it was significantly before September 2008 as a company we basically regard of the slowdown as an opportunity to maybe reset the competitive positioning within the market place. So without talking about anybody specific out there I think for example at the INTERGEO show which was the largest survey instruments trade show in the world which was in Germany in the late last September or early October.  We at Trimble had two booths in two halls. One was the Trimble booth, the Trimble brand in one hall with yellow product that has take with the high-end brand from high value high technology, relatively higher pricing in the other hall we had another booth that do not use the Trimble but use the name Spectra Precision and Nikon and that booth was unveiled bottom let's call a top to bottom entirely new product line and this was something other than Trimble product been at a different teller this was difference in function, difference in market positioning.  But of that I think represents a coming of age if you well of the [Brand B] strategy we have been talking about for number of years. Originally the [Brand B] strategy was really targeted at China to give us a mechanism for kind of meeting local competition in inside China but we have expanded it worldwide. So I think that just using that as an example from a strategic positioning standpoint we now have a better set of tools to go after that end of the market let's call the lower end market than we ever had before.  So with that sort of thing we are occupying new market space where we haven’t traditionally been as active as others have been and then I would say at the high end in terms of the comprehensive solutions oriented business the Virtual Site joint venture which will generate product for the first time in 2010 a new product completely new product as well as the other connective site sorts of initiatives we are doing I think we are laying claim to let's call the big picture solutions business as well. So I think during the slowdown is I think it overall represents an opportunity for us.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Great and the final question from me, Advanced Devices shrunk 15% or so 16% in 2009 is that kind of new level going forward is there anything interesting to be said about that division as you look ahead 12 months?
Steve Berglund: No, that particular segment tends to be kind of pretty steady and it will fluctuate around. We don’t see it is having, let’s call significant strategic upside from a revenue perspective. There are some ideas floating around in that that could turn out to be interesting from a pure technology standpoint. But I think what you see is what you get out of that segment and I wouldn’t be predicting big swings out of that segment anytime soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Rich Valera - Needham & Company: Thank you. I’d like to beat the Mobile Solutions for just a little bit more here. Steve you mentioned there was, you are somewhat taken off guard by how many I think layoffs you were seeing amongst your target customers. Can you characterize the trends you are seeing there, is that something that worsened in the back half of 2009 or do you think the worst is past in terms of the attrition and your target customer base for Mobile Solutions.
Steve Berglund: I think the answer is a little bit of yes or no on that, so, I think that we saw the worst of that particular phenomenon in early 2009. I think the thing that will be with us a little bit in 2010 is that some of these individual customers and some specific industries and I don’t necessarily want to go into detail, have some industry specific conditions that are putting our customers under stress and as a result we might see some fallout from that.  Now again we think that the overall effect is, the net effect will still be up into the right fairly strongly. But I think that there is some structural realignment accruing out in some of these industries that were serving there and then just as a matter of that we’ll see a little bit of volatility and little bit of churn but I think in terms of kind of across the board economic effects that are causing the social layoffs that I referred to, I think that was pretty much over in the first half of 2009 and what we have seen since then is a pretty steady environment and I would also say to emphasize the point as the larger players the enterprise level players out there that have many 100s or 1000s of units out there. They are feeling the pressure and they are looking to cut their cost, they are looking to improve their productivity and so on reality this environment is actually helpful when it comes to those classes of customers we are getting a lot of engagement with comparatively large enterprises that are looking to transform their cost base.
Rich Valera - Needham & Company: And just one for me for Raj, you have put up some decent revenue upside in the quarter that your EPS was within the guidance range you had given was there any unexpected expenses in the quarter or any area that saw margins maybe that weren’t quite where you expected.
Raj Bahri: Yes I think what happened is part of the revenue upside was foreign exchange, the dollar did weaken throughout the quarter and part of it was mix a little bit unfavorable than what thought so. From that basis we probably a penny shot versus our guidance where we should be but you know the high end of the guidance on the EPS side but our revenue wasn’t over mix so we should have probably delivered a penny more and mix hurt us and we were not able to do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: I just want a follow on what Paul had been asking earlier about how do you lever up as growth returns, how much more hiring do you have to do if any? Can you keep comp in line or you are going to have to start doing things like buying soda and water in places where you didn’t do that for a long time. How do you grow the business again.
Steve Berglund : Okay well let me point out that we been a cheap company forever and this is being cheap is not necessarily a new phenomenon for us and every employee on the line is probably smiling at this point in time because it’s true. So we didn’t do okay we engaged the issues we did a 10% plus reduction in forest starting before September 2008. So we have taken down kind of the structural cost in the company significantly over the last 18 months 18 to 24 months.  But in terms on the upside as we see upside buying large our decisions on adding cost back will be elective. We are not really mandated to add back cost as revenue goes up. Now, there are the obvious corner cases okay loading dock personnel assembly personal both sorts of things obviously scale pretty rigorously with revenue. So I think that and I am not suggesting we are going to this we talked about 35 to 40% operating leverage but in reality I think we start off with the ability being our choice of something pretty close to the gross margin number as being what we could drop to the operating line.  Now in reflecting on what we see in the environment and the fact that we do see growth opportunities out there and that we do see the ability to make our productive investments and what we are saying fairly explicitly here is for every dollar of revenue increase we would expect to drop $0.35 to $0.40 of that to the operating line and I think we can do that comfortably without any real stress that is what we have done historically for a long time has really focused on this operating leverage thing. So, I don’t think we have any mandated cost replacement sorts of issues facing us as a company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson with Dougherty & Company.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Just curious, what drove the strength in advanced devices this quarter?
Raj Bahri : You are referring to the fact that it grew slightly?
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Correct.
Raj Bahri : Last year Q4 was pretty bad and we did have some contractual work in our Applanix division that we finished, that generated some revenue for us as well. But more to the fact that Q4 of last year was really bad, the comps were a lot easier was part of it.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: So, this Applanix revenue is we shouldn’t model of that is recurring potential?
Raj Bahri : It was a couple of million dollars.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Securities.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Securities: Thank you, good afternoon. Few questions, back on the kind of the margins and it seems most of E&C margins is where your margins have been under pressure, you are doing, adding back that $2 million you are doing by about 13%. Historically during the mid 20, so is it going to take revenue growth is cost structure wide or anything else like product mix to get those margins back to mid 20s and is that a goal of yours?
Steve Berglund : Well, certainly as our view is that, okay, we are a 20% non-GAAP operating margin company, we have touched that level, we touched in the September 2008 quarter on a 12 month rolling basis for the first time. So we certainly see ourselves that way and given the gross margin structure of the E&C segment, it has the inherent structural characteristics necessary to generate a 20 plus percent operating margin business. So I think it is our expectation that we will return to those levels.  Now the answer on the revenue, yeah we will need some help from the revenue side to do that because we see the potential still there on the long-term so there was a limit to what we were willing to do on the cost reduction side there but we do see that as inherently a 20% plus operating margin business.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Securities: You highlighted that China was one of the highlights of the E&C segment with the recent user components out there. What's your thought and how long the Chinese stimulus will continue to benefit you guys and may be if you see anything beyond that continuing to benefit your business there?
Steve Berglund: Yeah I mean I think the China stimulus in the short-term is certainly may be environment more exciting but I think that looking at it in a 5 year context or even a 5 to 10 year context after the effects of China stimulus of past we still see this as an outstanding market opportunity simply because our penetration rate, the penetration rate of the technology we are selling into China is still at a very low rate. So there is just really upside everywhere we can see in China in terms of selling technology and end number of applications.  The other thing that more structural is that inherently really to current times but certainly prior to 2009 most of what we were selling into China was survey instruments, that was by far and away the dominating product category. We are expanding that product range out and bringing all the other Trimble products into China and so we are building our self a larger wider product platform in China so we have more growth opportunity or more look for growth in China then we have before so we don’t see this is a short term phenomenon yeah there might be some feeding frenzy aspects to this but we see this is fundamentally a very strong growth market for 5 to 10 years.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Securities: Last question I had is on the mobile solutions and more on this new forestry products you have out there you said in the past you kind of see this $15 million annual revenue opportunity is it something in the back half this year you just see kind of in the single million and you see 2011 being more material or is it kind of longer term than that?
Steve Berglund: I am going to be careful just because kind of the contractual cycle and the implementation cycle in this business is turning out to be a little slower than we thought 6 or 9 months ago. So let just say I put kind of put it this way without necessarily putting a stake in the ground as the total 2010 sorts of numbers. But certainly by the time we leave the year the run rate in that business should be providing a lot of volatility to my relative optimism here so I would say I am not going to necessarily call the number for the year but I would say by the time we leave the year we should be pretty compelling in incredible on the whole thing.
Operator:  With that there are no further question thank you for joining us.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Molly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the financial results for Q3 2009 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Ms. McManmon, you may begin your conference.
Willa McManmon: Good afternoon. I am here today with Steve Berglund, our President and CEO; and Raj Bahri, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the forward-looking statements made in today's call in the subsequent Q&A period are subject to risks and uncertainties. Trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors including the competitive nature of the marketplace, the condition of the worldwide economy and other factors detailed in the company's Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will refer to a press release. The press release and additional financial statements are posted on our website at www.trimble.com. The non-GAAP measures discussed in the call are reconciled to GAAP measures in the tables on a press release. Let me now turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. The third quarter, while not yet compelling from a financial perspective, provided us with the first unambiguous signs of recovery in some of our markets. Although, we were modestly below our overall revenue target, we saw a marked revival of some of our core E&C markets in U.S. from the levels we encountered earlier in the year. While the remaining U.S. and European economic uncertainties make precise forecasts difficult, these sources of recovery enable us to anticipate double-digit company revenue growth in 2010 with the disproportionately positive affect on earnings. The Engineering and Construction segment continues to reflect ongoing and widespread difficulties, but is also demonstrating improved willingness by some of our users to invest in technology. In the U.S., we are seeing increased resiliency in our heavy and highway markets as well as our surveying instruments business. This improvement is occurring without much identifiable impact from the stimulus package. The commercial building and residential markets remained sidelined at this point, although we are hopeful that the improvement and survey instrument sales are leading indicators to some improvement in these areas as well. The European and international markets remained mixed with the exception of China, which continues to be a source of strength. While recognizing the still weekend and volatile state of the economy, we now believe the E&C segment can grow in reasonable double digits in 2010. Any revenue increase coupled with the cost-cutting already taken will allow earnings to grow significantly faster than revenue. The Field Solution segment reflected a decline in agricultural revenue year-to-year and offset the improvements we saw in E&C. The slower agriculture market has resulted from the tighter credit conditions in markets such as Brazil, weather conditions in some countries and a reaction of farmers to the general economic uncertainties. Despite the slower than anticipated demand in the market, our view continues to be that 2009 represents a resetting of the agricultural technology market after bubble years in 2007 and 2008, and that the underlying long-term technology trend line remains intact. We expect a new equilibrium to be established by early 2010, and we expect to grow agriculture sales in 2010 at a rate consistent with the long-term double-digit trend line. The Mobile Solution segment continues to build the momentum during the quarter which will lead to stronger 2010 financials. But recently announced BT, British Gas and Linfox wins all reflect a drive to improve productivity in large fleets in Mobile Workforces. Activity in smaller fleets in workforces continues to be a challenge for us as the smaller operators have a way to turn in the economy and renew business confidence. We also received in the quarter as yet unannounced significant order from the [forestry] initiative we launched in the second half of last year. Beyond this initial order, we are in contractual discussions or running field trials with other forestry industry participants that represent a multi-year revenue potential of over $50 million. For the last several quarters, we have discussed our efforts to reduce churn in the Mobile Solution segment and is potential to have a meaningful effect on both the reported revenue and profitability. We believe we have now established the multi-quarter trend that is leading us toward lower churn levels and believe these efforts will have a positive impact in 2010 results. Taken together, we believe these market and operational initiatives will allow us to domestic robust double-digit revenue and profit growth in the Mobile Solution segment in 2010. Company-wide, we are growing more confident that we have passed through the inflection point now returning to an environment that has more opportunities than disappointments. In general, we expect the E&C segment to demonstrate the earliest return to better year-over-year comparisons led by heavy and highway, which should begin to reflect double-digit growth beginning in the fourth quarter. While expecting growth from Field Solutions for the entire year in 2010, the comparisons to prior year will remain relatively difficult in the fourth and first quarters. We expect the biggest year-on-year moves to take place in the second through the fourth quarters next year. Mobile Solutions will show a steady progression during 2010 as backlog is converted to recurring revenue after the installation process is complete. Almost all Trimble businesses are planning for meaningful recovery in 2010. This is a slower process that assumes the economy remains comparatively impaired during 2010 and provides us with only modest lift. If the economy does not throw any new shocks at us and we see the modest improvements in the economy continue, we are expecting reasonable double-digit revenue growth in 2010 with significant earnings progression. Overall, the planning environment remains complex with both individual businesses and regions at different points in the recovery process. With the number of moving parts in our business, we will be dealing with probability of greater than normal volatility. Raj will describe some of these resources of volatility in the context of the fourth quarter guidance. Overall, our focus remains unchanged restoring our financial model, improving our competitive position, and reinforcing the sources of short and long-term growth, but we are encouraged by what we see in many of our markets. The economic environment remains challenging and will require a response from us that is significantly more than as usual. Let me now turn the call over to Raj.
Raj Bahri: Good afternoon. Today, we announced third quarter revenue of $269.7 million, down approximately 18% from revenue of $328.1 million in the third quarter of 2008. GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2009 was $20.2 million, down approximately 63% from the third quarter of 2008. The operating margin in the third quarter of 2009 was 7.5%, as compared to an operating margin of 16.5% in the third quarter of 2008. Please note that we have provided a detailed table of the items included in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in our press release issued this afternoon. Non-GAAP operating of $40 million was down 43% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating margin was 14.8% in the third quarter of 2009 compared to 21.3% in the third quarter of 2009. The margin decline was primarily driven by revenue decline, partially offset by operating expense reduction. Third quarter 2009 GAAP net income was $15.6 million, down 60% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Diluted GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of 2009 were $0.13 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.31 in the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP net income of $30.2 million for the third quarter of 2009 was down 40% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2009 were $0.25 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.40 in the third quarter of 2008. The tax rate in the third quarter was 27%. Cash flow from operations continues to be strong at $30 million for the quarter. By geography in the third quarter, 57% of our revenue came from North America, 21% from Europe, 16% from Asia-Pacific, and 6% from rest of the world. Revenue declined 15% in North America, 26% in Europe, 5% in Asia-Pacific, and 37% in rest of the world. Now I will cover non-GAAP results by segment, which exclude the factor noted in our press release under Trimble results by segment. Third quarter 2009 E&C revenue was $149.4 million, down approximately 22% as compared to the third quarter of 2008, largely due to continued recessionary conditions in Europe and North America. It is important to note that E&C was down 32% year-over-year for the first half of 2009. The 22% decline in the third quarter, although severe, was an improvement in the trend. Additionally, E&C is typically down in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to the seasonality. This quarter's E&C revenue of $149 million was actually up versus the second quarter revenue of $147 million. In the third quarter 2009, non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $22.7 million or 15.2% of revenue compared to $42.7 million or 22.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2008. The decline in operating margin was primarily due to lower revenue. Third quarter 2009 Field Solutions revenue was $55.7 million, down 14% compared to the third quarter of 2008. The revenue decline was driven by lower agriculture product sales due to weather conditions that result in delays harvest and declines in farm incomes. In the third quarter of 2009, non-GAAP operating income in Field Solutions was $16.6 million, or 29.8% of revenue compared to $22.3 million, or 34.6% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in non-GAAP operating margin was due to lower revenue. Third quarter 2009 Mobile Solutions revenue was $39.6 million, down approximately 3% when compared to the third quarter of 2008. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to softness in ready mix hardware sales. In the third quarter of 2009, non-GAAP operating income in Mobile Solutions was $4.3 million, or 10.9% of revenue down from 11.2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2008. Third quarter 2009 Advanced Devices revenue was $25.1 million, down approximately 19% when compared to third quarter of 2008. The decline in third quarter revenue was due to lower sales of embedded, timing and Applanix products. In the third quarter of 2009, non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $4.9 million, or 19.5% of revenue compared to 23.1% of revenue in the third quarter of 2008. The reduction in operating margin was due to product mix. Moving onto the total company, total company non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2009 came in at $98.8 million compared to $102.7 million in the third quarter of 2008, a 4% decline. Costs contentment measures resulted in $8 million of savings this quarter partially offset by acquisitions. Non-operating income for the third quarter of 2009 was $1.4 million versus $1.6 million of non-operating income in the third quarter of 2008. The decline was due to decreased profits from the joint ventures partially offset by foreign exchange hedging impacts. We finish the third quarter of 2009 with $222 million in cash compared to $119.2 million in the second quarter of 2009. We generated $30 million of cash flow from operations for the quarter and year-to-date so far, we have cash flow from operations of $139.1 million, down only $2.8 million from the cash flow from operations of $141.9 million in the first nine months of 2008. We have $151.5 million of debt basically flat with the second quarter of 2009. We used $12 million for acquisition this quarter and we did not repurchase any stock in the quarter. In the third quarter, net accounts receivable was $202.5 million, up from $199.9 million in the second quarter of 2009. Day sales outstanding was 60 days down three days versus the third quarter of 2008. Inventory was $160.4 million compared to $168.3 million in the second quarter of 2009. Returns were 3.3 times down from 3.5 it versus the second quarter of 2009. Deferred revenue of $78 billion was up $10.3 million from the beginning of 2009 and flat as compared to deferred revenue of $77.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. Turning now to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect revenue between $265 million and $270 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.08 to $0.10 and non-GAAP per share of $0.19 to $0.21. Non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of 2009 excludes amortization of intangible of $14.8 million related to previous acquisitions and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $5 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share resume a 30% to 32% tax rate and 123 million shares outstanding. The tax rate is higher because a disproportionate amount of profit is coming from the U.S. where we pay a much higher tax rate than in rest of the world. This is reflected of the fact that U.S. is recovering ahead of the rest of the world. We will expect a 2010 tax rate in the 28% to 30% range. Additionally, it should be noted that the fourth quarter guidance shows about $0.02 of negative impact from some one-time investment in the new [SITECH] joint venture with Cat which are not expected to impact Q1 of 2010. With that, I'll turn the call over for your questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: My first question is on the E&C side of your business. Looking at the prospects of double-digit revenue growth, I was wondering if you could comment on the incremental margin contribution of revenue growth given some of the cost-containment efforts you've taken this year.
Steve Berglund: Yeah. So, I think convert again into amount of fairly straight forward arithmetic without a whole lot of necessarily deep insight, but we've got a 50% gross margin. And so if we just use that as the actual incremental gross margin might be a bit higher. The question is how much of that do we drop to the bottomline on any sort of revenue recovery. So, I think the topside will be 50%. I think if you look at us historically in strong operating leverage quarters, we intended to do 32% to 35%. So, I would say depending on exact circumstances, the exact nature of it coming out of this in the early stages, I would expect to see between 30% and 50% marginal operating leverage coming out of it. So out of every dollar revenue that we'd be dropping somewhere between $0.30 and $0.50 to the bottomline, again, depending on the precise circumstances.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Within the Mobile Solutions segment now that the churn seems to be well under control and you're filling the pipeline with your own contract wins here recently. Could you talk maybe a little bit about what perhaps even a longer term margin profile of that Mobile Solutions business could look like as these contracts are converted?
Steve Berglund: So I think from the very beginning, we've been slow to execute. But from the very beginning, I think we've always viewed this market as being, let's call, somewhere in the range of a 20% to 30% operating margin business, but certainly in the 20%, we'll see if we can get it above 25%. Again, much the same sort of argument that once you get the recurring streams to be a substantial part of the business, they carry with them very substantial gross margins often times in excess of 60%. If you can control your costs below that, again, it can be quite a profitable business. Today is the revenue still has a fairly heavy hardware component associated with it, which tends to bring down the incremental margins. So, again, I think as steady state, I would expect to see an operating margin in and a fairly broad range, but somewhere between 20% and 30%, I guess where we'll find that when we get it to 20%.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: My last question is on the build of cash. I understand that you have very low-cost debt on the balance sheet, no need to move that off. But just be curious that how you are prioritizing the use of cash given the position you are in now?
Steve Berglund: Again, I think our priority is to productively use the cash within the business. So, I think that we now have a nine or 10-year tradition of making relatively small fill-in acquisitions. I would expect that to continue to be our style, unless circumstances change, but generally, I would expect us to have a fairly small but fill-in acquisitions. Beyond that, I think that our management's view is that cash is not necessarily a productive asset. We wouldn't necessarily want it to build up as a low return asset. So, I think that as circumstances change and that we do build up additional cash, I think we'd at least reconsider going back to a buyback as a secondary use of cash beyond and acquisitions.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson with Dougherty & Company.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company:  Raj, could you talk a little bit about why the TMS operating margins were down sequentially? There were just some ramp-up costs there of your recent deals or what?
Raj Bahri:  Initially, we are installing hardware which gives us the hardware margin which is tends to be not as great as the recording revenue margin. So, it was slightly down, but it was primarily, Jeff, driven by mix. As a trend line, I would expect it to increase sequentially now starting in Q4.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay, so mix shift towards hardware in the quarter.
Raj Bahri: A little bit mix shift towards hardware. Yeah, but I expect it to sequentially go up now every quarter.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company:  Can you tell us how many BT units you deployed in the quarter?
Raj Bahri:  No. I think we just assume to keep that to ourselves. Thank you.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Raj, what was the impact of acquisitions in the quarter to revenue growth?
Raj Bahri: Revenue, around two points of growth.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Two on a basis points?
Raj Bahri: Yes.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Mostly in E&C?
Raj Bahri: No. I had some acquisitions we bought. Since last year we bought around three to four companies in Ag.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay. So...
Raj Bahri: Ag was the big impact in acquisitions and E&C is secondary.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay. You talked about the $0.02 for SITECH...
Raj Bahri: Yeah,
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Is that expense included in your guidance?
Raj Bahri: It is included in our guidance. That's why without that, we would have expected our guidance to be $0.02 higher.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: $0.02 higher good, very good. Then Steve, two questions for you. I'd be curious to know if you think it would be possible for E&C to actually even post some growth in the Q4 on a year-over-year basis. If you could give us an update on how the SITECH and the joint venture agreements are coming together?
Steve Berglund: So, I think E&C probably will post growth in the fourth quarter. I think the relative paradigm for the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter last year is E&C growth and I think a certain amount of caution in agriculture. But I think at this point in time, we've kind of left the year here and we're now dealing with kind of the disaster of last year. So, I think we're back in a mode where we're anticipating over a year growth in E&C. As far as SITECH and the virtual site activities, without a doubt SITECH, I guess the comparison point of a year ago when we launched it, they are still rolling out. We have greater than 10 SITECHs in place at this point in time. We've got two or three times that number in play at this point. So, there is lots of activity but I think that the mind share gap that was created a year ago with kind of the meltdown has slowed us down. But I think that we're now getting back on track and I think that over the next six months, we should be landing a fair number of these. So, I think that we're on track, but we're certainly behind where we thought we would be a year ago. But everybody has been dealing with the aftermath of the economic meltdown. Generally, I would say in terms of product development of putting the joint venture together, it was really to take the software from Caterpillar called equipment manager and combined it with Trimble construction manager and come out with an entirely new suite of software. I would say we are on track there, and I would say that during 2010, in fact, in the first half of 2010, there will be substantial progress shown in terms of the new product there. So, I would say product wise, we're more or less on the timescale that we had laid out a year ago. On the distribution side, we're moving slower, but largely because everybody took six months to just deal with the aftermath of this economic meltdown.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Just drill down very quickly on that just for a second, can you give us some sense of when we might see data recording devices deployed on OEM machinery? Could that be the first half of 2010 or back half of 2010?
Steve Berglund: Well, I'd qualify that by saying, in terms of data devices able to deal with the new software, I would say is in general and this is actually a complicated question and a simple answer. I would say is that you should be seeing outcomes from that in the first half of 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer & Company.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company:  Steve, you mentioned that you've started beginning to see unambiguous signs of recovery in the U.S. I was wondering if you might be able to share some anecdotes that give you comfort with that thesis?
Steve Berglund:  First of all, let me qualify, better is not necessarily good. So, if things are better, I wouldn't necessarily call them good out there. But against the standards that was set in the fourth quarter, particularly in fourth quarter and first quarter last year and early this year, we've definitely seen a bounce in the U.S. from the levels that were established there. The second quarter was more confused. But I think in the third quarter, we can properly characterize what we see was a bounce from the level that we saw earlier in the year. It does not have the same kind of convincing feel that, say, the fourth that we encountered later in this last half of 2002. So I think this one is going to be a more drawn-out affair than what we saw coming out of the recession, 2001-2002. But again, I think that we saw a pretty convincing bounce in the U.S. on survey instruments, which we're a having a difficult year anyway in 2008 even before September 15th. So, we saw a fairly significant bounce in revenue in the U.S. The other places I said, that we saw it was in heavy and highway, again, were nowhere as close to the peak levels we saw in 2007. But against the levels of, now a year ago and early 2009, we are definitely seeing recovery there. I think kind of the products that are more related to commercial building and housing, I think that's yet to come.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: In terms of China, that's obviously been a source of strength for you for a while now. When you look at the projects that are in the pipeline and around a corner, do you think that China and maybe Asia generally can continue to provide some tailwind in 2010?
Steve Berglund: Yeah. I think we're counting heavily on that. I think the plan in China is really two-fold kind of two dimensional. One is for the places where we've always had a product position in China, particularly, survey instruments in some aspects of China. Construction, I think yeah there is still a lot of market lift a lot of building, a lot of infrastructure build still to go in 2010. But I think the thing that's as interesting if not in a longer term more interesting is we're starting to get leverage in those product areas where we've really never had much of a participation in China, so, for example, Mobile Resource Management, GIS utilities as a category. So, we're both broadening our base as well as having success in our traditional products in China. So, I think that we are building, what I would call, a long-term platform in China, not risk-free, but we are building a platform in China that I think leads to long-term success not just something that's related to a momentary construction boom.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: Just one more question for Raj and then I'll see the floor. Raj, the $0.02 impact next quarter from the JV, where would that appear in the income statement?
Raj Bahri: I mean we consolidate this JV. So, it will be part of our operating income. It will show up in operating expenses.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: In the operating…
Raj Bahri: Just to make sure, you know, so Q1 we expect that it will not repeat in Q1. So, Q1 we will actually see a reverse, that $0.02 somewhat come back.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: So, essentially, there is going to be $0.02 worth of a step-up, one-time step-up in SG&A.
Raj Bahri: Yeah, that's right. That's right.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel.
Andy Young - Thomas Weisel: This is actually Andy Young standing in for Ajit. Just a couple of quick questions. The first one is your international effort. Can you give some colors in term of what other things you are doing outside of China?
Steve Berglund: You mean international in general outside of China?
Andy Young - Thomas Weisel: Right.
Steve Berglund: There are actually a number of things. So, first of all, our effort in India is also taking a substantial step-up in terms of scale and scope is. A couple weeks ago, we had a road show in China where every Trimble Business travel China, sorry, India. Every Trimble business traveled around India and presented the company just to raise our collective company brand in India. We are stepping up the number of sales resources we have in India. We now have over 200 employees in India. So, we already have presence in India. So I think India, which will be a longer term developing process than maybe China, but with substantial opportunity. So, I think India is one place where we are significantly increasing our presence from a point that wasn't all that impressive a few years ago, we're highly engage with the market at this point in time. But then even in places like Africa and North and South Africa, we have a growing presence. We see Africa as being of interest, because there is a substantial emphasis on infrastructure build taking place in Africa and hence survey instruments to establish property lines, reference systems to enable that survey and to take place ultimately, construction both for building and road construction but also for mining. So, there is a great deal of activity in Africa and we believe that can be a growth market for us. So, in the last few months, we've actually opened a sales office in Nairobi. I suspect we, maybe, the only Silicon Valley company with an office in Nairobi, Kenya. So Africa as a place is of interest to us. Then Russia is a place where we recently named the country manager there. We're upgrading our infrastructure, organizational infrastructure Russia for the long-term and there'll probably be more news on that in the next six to nine months, again, a long-term play. Obviously, Russia is fairly volatile depending on the price of oil, but viewing that as a long-term developmental effort on our part. So, those are what I would call a cross-selection of geographies, but in reality, I think that we're viewing the growth potential of the next five to 10 years to be more heavily weighted outside of our traditional comfort zone of Western Europe and North America. So, we are actively redeploying resources out of Western Europe and North America to these places, in some sense taking advantage of the slowdown to reconsider just where our resources are. So, substantial increases in resources in all those places.
Andy Young - Thomas Weisel: As you look for to 2010, you mentioned that you expect double-digit growth. So do you still expect Asia and other emerging markets leading the growth and then followed by United States, North America and then Europe is still lagging behind?
Steve Berglund: Well, yeah. I think in terms of the last statement, I think Europe is definitely going to trail the U.S. out of this. Europe is a collection of anecdotes, some positive, some negative but in general Europe is still I thinking lagging the U.S. in terms of the recovery profile. I think probably statistically when it comes specifically to 2010 maybe the U.S. will be the larger part of the story just in terms of putting numbers on the board. As the U.S. starts to recover, it will probably do more on the short-term to boost us. But, I will say longer term is a statement, but the rest of the world is still meaningful which is over the next five years, I think the non-traditional markets will lead the way in terms of growth. But in 2010, maybe the U.S. will probably feature more in the story just as it recovers and gives us back some of the numbers we lost in 2009.
Andy Young - Thomas Weisel: One final question about foreign exchange. What do you see a the impact of foreign exchange on your sales, sales growth, and also in terms of margins?
Raj Bahri: Sure. Actually if you look at last year versus last year at the same time, dollar was a bit stronger than last year and slightly so that hurt our sales by a little bit, by a point-and-a-half. So pretty much what we gained in the acquisitions we lost in foreign exchange on our sales and we've clearly closed the naturally hedged on the cost of goods sold because we have lot of R&D and expenses in Europe, so it didn't have an impact on the operating income line.
Andy Young - Thomas Weisel: Going forward, you expect the same type of sensitivity to...
Raj Bahri: I think the dollar has weakened in October or somewhat. So, that may sequentially help us somewhat in this revenue side, but again on the operating income side, we don't expect it to move the needle.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Ingalls & Snyder.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: If you've already answered this, because I had to step away for a few minutes, but in looking at next year 2010, how much are your expectations, which gave us in pretty good detail, depending upon a recovery in the underlying equipment business out there, such as Caterpillar and elsewhere. How much is simply additional applications? In other words, could your forecast be affected if, let's say, there were a renewed recession and that there was no to recovery in the heavy equipment business in 2010?
Steve Berglund: What we're talking about here is to a large extent not terribly tied to the equipment cycle. Again, our fundamental value propositions that we sell productivity we don't sell capacity. So it was called a recessionary environment. I would hope to establish a break between us and the equipment manufacturers or at least there has always been the correlation. This year has been kind of stunning from the fact that it was so bad that everyone went to the sidelines and just order cash and we're not willing to make any kind of investment even in productivity. So, I would say is that our relative optimism in terms of talking about double-digit growth is to a large extent not really tied to the equipment cycle. In fact, I would believe that we should be a leading indicator. There is a lot of capacity out there still to be used up before there is going to be a vigorous recovery in equipment sales, but I think that we go out and we can sell productivity. So, with any kind of return of business confidence in some low level of optimism about the future, I think we can sell into that. And so, I would say, our numbers are not particularly tied to the equipment cycle, the sales of new equipment.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: So, you're retrofitting a lot of older equipment is what you are saying?
Steve Berglund:  Yes.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: The productivity improvement in 2009, people just weren't spending on Asia. So you expect them to have some improvement in that situation in 2010 regardless of what happens.
Raj Bahri:  Right, right. I think the paradigm we're pursuing is we can walk into either onto the contractor's yard or a fleet manager's yard, walk into the office to the purchasing manager or the person making the procurement decision and say, well, we're really sorry about the fact that 50% of your fleet is parked outside, but let's talk about the 50% you're still using. Let us help you make that 25% or 30% more productive, and I suppose parking additional 10% or 15% of your fleet as a result. But again, in this kind of environment which is for a contractor, for example, construction contractor, the level of competitive intensity in this environment is just orders of magnitude worse than it was two years ago. The survival of that contract is partially going to be dependent upon squeezing out every drop of productivity. So, I think that productivity will sell in this environment short of kind of the knocked down that we've seen for the last So I think we can break the link between sales and us and so on to the existing fleets.
Operator: Your next question comes from one of Paul Coster with JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse - JPMorgan: Hi, it's actually Mark Strouse on behalf of Paul. We just want to get your latest thoughts on the potential impacts from the U.S. stimulus plan and how much of the double-digit growth in E&C next year is dependent upon that.
Steve Berglund: I think, basically, we're not counting on the stimulus as any part of that kind of talk by double digits. I think in reality, and this can be argued maybe successfully both ways. But I think in reality given that in many cases there is a permitting cycle and a regulatory cycle here in the U.S. that can be as long as two years. So, with the launch of the stimulus program in early 2009, it could very well be that much of that stimulus that's might be flowing in our direction will actually show up as a net change element in the later part of 2010. So, I think that we're not basing a whole lot of our view on 2010 on U.S. stimulus showing up. Now, the Chinese stimulus started flowing soon after it was announced. So I think that if the stimulus actually does start to lift things that will be what I would call additional good news beyond anything that we've forecasted at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Corey Tobin].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. Let me, if I could, just expand on the last question. Obviously, we are happy to hear about the unambiguous signs of recovery in the U.S. Is Steve and everyone else as you're talking to customers, what are they attributing sort of their increased buying trends too. I mean if its not necessarily stimulus spending taken in, is it just heavy and highway spending by the states or are there are end markets that are starting to see better signs of recovery?
Steve Berglund: There is project flow of there. Again, it's nothing like what we would have seen two years ago or even a year-and-a-half ago. So this is slimmer pickings than anything we've seen in a while. So, it's better, it's certainly not good. But I think that there is project flow out there. I think a significant difference that of the last six months is that, okay, let's just call a beginnings of the return of business confidence. So, I think six months ago, certainly a year ago, even six months ago, maybe even more recently than that, it was to a large extent is people that in rationally should have been buying. Back to these contractors or fleet managers that I was talking about or even surveyors out there, they were so uncertain about the environment that they just went to the sidelines. And so I think the effect we're seeing a much as anything as that people are actually starting to plan and prepare for the future after taking a hiatus of six or nine months after last September 15. So it's hard to point the finger at any one thing, but I think that it's more a return to a business confidence and our ability and, again, our premises that we can sell into a recession. On September 12th last year, we were selling into a recession with some degree of success. I think with that we can return to that. And as long as there is some project flow, and there is some project flow out there that I think we can stitch together an improving trend. But I think the big lift from the economy is still to come and frankly, we're not really planning on that in 2010. If it comes, it will be kind of very good news to what we've got already have planned.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And shifting gears for just a second. In the Mobile Segment, we're happy to hear about the sings of the pipeline increasing in Asia, as I think you mentioned earlier. When would you expect to see a material contract coming out of the Asia-Pacific region for Mobile Services?
Raj Bahri: Well, in reality, the Linfox announcement was an Asian deal. So Linfox operates all over Asia. They have got source strength in Australia. So, Linfox is I think, let's call it the first of the Asian deals and Linfox operates in between five and 10 Asian countries anyway. And so I think that ultimately the expectation is that we'll deploy throughout Asia there so is what I would call the first off hopefully many.
Unidentified Analyst: How about specifically in China?
Raj Bahri: In China, let's just say, we've got dedicated resources on the ground in terms of the MRM space and I guess we'll have to wait to see what happens in China. For the last 12 months, maybe longer than 12 months, we have had dedicated resources in China on MRM. Obviously, it's a different market, and we're doing some learning there but I would hope to have some level of success in a relatively short period of time.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of David Delleo with Canaccord Adams.
David Delleo - Canaccord Adams: Just a couple quick questions with regards to the Field Solutions segments. Looking at Q4, obviously, seasonality is a factor. Is there a potential here that Q4 could be better seasonally due to a late harvest and we could maybe see some of a pickup of what we might have lost in Q3? How are you thinking about margins for the segment in Q4 based on what was reported this quarter?
Steve Berglund: Yeah. There weather is a constant source of uncertainty. But I am not going to go so far as to try to project what the outcome would be of that uncertainty, but I think, yeah, statistically, I wouldn't necessarily be expecting any late harvest in the U.S. might be compensated by a poor spring in Brazil or something like that. So, I think that there is a little bit of a statistical argument here of weather affects in one country with the offset of weather affects in another country. So I wouldn't necessarily be counting on any one thing to move it. On the margin issue, I'll let Raj maybe add more color, but affectively, I think the cost structure is relatively fixed. So, what you do see as these seasonal affects roll through is the effect of gross margins. I would say as that operating the margins will track seasonally but in a fairly predictable way.
David Delleo - Canaccord Adams: Then as far as year-over-year decline, I mean, are we able to say here that we might have seen the worst of the year-over-year declines here in September in the Q3 quarter or is it kind of too early to tell? I mean how has the Q4 tracked so far?
Steve Berglund: Overall or in Ag or…
David Delleo - Canaccord Adams: I'm sorry, in Ag.
Steve Berglund: In Ag. I'd say that we're being cautious about ag at this point in time. Is that again there are an awful lot of moving parts in ag. So I think the way we would characterize -- well, in the script is I tried to kind of paint a picture of a little bit of caution in the fourth quarter and first quarter as it comes to the Field Solutions. I think that in terms of year-to-year comps is definitely get better in the second quarter. So I think, second through the fourth quarter next year, we're feeling pretty confident on. I think we're waiting to see just what the effects are in the fourth and first quarter. So, I think there is a wide range of possibilities here. Partly because the equipment guys can paint one story in ag, but the sales technology hasn't always been consistent with that, consistent with kind of the equipment sales for the picture painted by the equipment guys. Certainly, earlier this year as we broke with the kind of the underlying trends of the equipment guys. That's caught up to us a little bit here in the third quarter. But I think that, certainly, the feel is relatively positive relative to the quarter, but I think we're putting a fair amount of cautionary note on it. So I think what we're counting on here in the fourth quarter is generally rising trend on the construction side and a fair amount of caution being applied to ag until we actually see what the effects are. But certainly over the next year, we remain pretty positive on that.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Steve Berglund: Okay, in that case, thank you for attending. We will talk to you next quarter. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Karee and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. Ms. McManmon, you may begin your conference.
Willa McManmon: Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2009 conference call. I am here today with Steve Berglund, our CEO and Raj Bahri, our CFO. During the course of this call we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. The words intend, expect, plan or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. Important factors relating to our business including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are described in our Form 10-Q, 10-K and other filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes and assumptions or other factors. Before I turn the call over to Steve, I would like to mention that we will be attending the (inaudible) conference in New York City on May 14, as well as the William Blair conference in Chicago on June 9, Steve?
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. As we anticipated in last call the first quarter look much like the fourth quarter. The engineering and construction segment remains in a historical unprecedented downturn. Slowdown is worldwide with China the only current reliable source of growth. The level of uncertainty remains high and the ability to reliably forecast of business remains limited. Historical patterns and market behavior we have been able to rely on as predicted indicators or non-currently operative which leaves us reacting to highly dynamic real-time world. The current paradox is that despite the significant downturn we have seen during last six months. The level of interest and activity in the marketplace is significantly higher than the results would indicate. This activity typically takes the former product demos in quotes; these are not turning into orders at anything like the historical rate, which implies there is pent-up market demand combined with the hard freeze on the spending. This tends to confirm our hypothesis that our primary problem at the moment is win a business confidence. More so the underlying demand for productivity and productivity enhancing capabilities. We believe the inflection point for us in the E&C segment will come when business confidence begins to shift. Not necessarily solely upon economic recovery. In other words our upturn may proceed recovery of the industry as it is typically measured. The Field Solutions segment demonstrated double-digit revenue growth year-over-year and improved margins. This was a reflection of agricultural results, which provided year-over-year progression despite a very difficult comp in last years results. Our sales of large agricultural equipment such as tractors appear to be slowing. We continue to have careful optimism on the 12 month prospects from maintaining or growing our agriculture business. This relative optimism is based on the ability of technology to improve the bottom line for farmers under cost pressure. The potential for continued international expansion and the revenue potential of our expanded product line. Mobile Solutions results were inline with expectations with the year-to-year revenue decline primarily a result of special circumstances in 2008 that cost us spike in revenue. Despite the revenue decline we are encouraged by the year-to-year improvement in operating margin. We remain committed to the promise that we can walk in to a fleet manager's office during a recession and make the case for an immediate reduction of fuel costs and an improvement in capital utilization. Although we see the same general lack of business confidence and reluctance to spend in Mobile Solutions as we see an E&C. We see a number of reasons to remain relatively optimistic about the 12 month prospects on this segment. First, although investment activity in small fleets are severely diminished, the interesting commitment to investment among larger enterprises remains comparatively high. We have either received or are about to receive significant orders from a number of larger enterprises that will result in a substantial number of new subscribers measured in the five figures. We also believe we will receive other significant orders later in the second quarter. A second reason for careful optimism is our relative success in bringing our Mobile Solutions capabilities international from a base that was substantially centered in the US two year's ago. These efforts have enlarged through opportunities set and resulted in a more diverse revenue stream. The third reason is that in the Mobile Solutions market space we tend to be comparatively advantaged bringing scale, reputation and competencies and staying power to the table. This combination is proving, compelling in a number of competitive scenarios when a fleet manager wants to see both financial stability and the ability to continually reinvest in the solution. Beyond these reasons for optimism we need to closely monitor the churn rates in Mobile Solutions. Churn we inherited from that rose still at a rate we consider to be excessive even though we continue to make progress in attacking new causes. In addition, in this economic environment some portion of customer fleets is being part which is taking units out of the field and adding new churn. We believe the churn rate provides us with more upside potential and reducing it being downside risk but it does remain a consideration. Beyond the details of each of the segments, our overall focus remains unchanged restoring our financial model, improving our competitive position and reinforcing the sources of short-term and long-term growth. Our emphasis on improving the quality of our financial models is focused on operating income as a percentage of revenue. Our model recovers somewhat in the first quarter from the fourth quarter level and with the non-GAAP operating margin of 15.9% is comparatively respectable. We are also encouraged as three of our four segments showed improved operating margins year-over-year as a percentage of revenue. Our overall gross margin actually improved year-over-year which reflects both cost control, favorable product mix and enabling systemic pricing declines. We continue to focus each of our businesses on a line revenue and cost with the intention to return to our status as a 20% operating margin business. The cost cuts we made in January which were not fully reflected in the quarterly results are based on our best judgment at the time. With the volatility and E&C demand and the resulting inability to establish a reliable base line expectation, establishing the right balance between short-term cost cutting and the maintenance of long-term growth capabilities as challenging. The key questions impacting this trade-off were centered on the debt group [ph] of slow down, its duration and the robustness and breadth of the recovery. The opportunity to improve our competitive position is based on our significant comparative strengths. We have a robust financial model that should stand up relatively well. We have no net debt that would encumber our decision making. We have an organization that is more capable than ever before and we have a product portfolio that is strengthening. We also have strong cash flows to accelerating innovation, to opportunistically add new capabilities and to expand our market position. We also retain significant growth opportunities from Greenfield market segments and product classes, some of which can be exploited in the short-term and others which will become more evident when we reach the inflection point. In summary, we have no particularly advantage insight into either of the remainder of 2009 or 2010. We will take conditions as they come and react proportionately but always with the intention of moving forward if at a slower rate. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Raj Bahri: Good afternoon. Revenue for the first quarter of 2009 was $289 million, down approximately 19% from revenue of $355.3 million in the first quarter of 2008. Operating income for the first quarter of 2009 was $24.3 million down approximately 58% from the first quarter of 2008. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2009 was 8.4% compared to operating margin of 16.3% in the first quarter of 2008. Adjusting for the items that are reconciled in our financial tables in today's press release. Non-GAAP operating income of $45.9 million was down 37% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.9% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 20.5% in the first quarter of 2008, although, margins was down versus the first quarter of 2008, we saw a significant improvement in non-GAAP margin versus fourth quarter of 2008 non-GAAP operating margin of 10.7%. The sequential margin improvement was due to higher revenue and partial quarter impact of the restructuring implemented in January of this year. First quarter 2009 net income was $17.5 million, down 56% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.14 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.32 in the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP net income of $33.7 million for the first quarter of 2009 was down 33% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.28 compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 in the first quarter of 2008. The tax rate in the first quarter was 25%. Cash flow from operations was strong at $43 million more than double the $21 million in cash flow in the first quarter of prior year. By geography, in the first quarter 58% of revenue was in North America, 23% in Europe, 14% in Asia Pacific and 5% in the rest of the world. This represents revenue decline of 13% in North America, 30% in Europe, 11% in Asia pacific and 35% in the rest of the world. I think it's important to know that despite the decline in Asia Pacific revenues, China did show very strong double-digit growth. I will now cover the results by segment excluding the factors noted in our press release under Trimble results by segment. First quarter 2009 E&C revenue was $127.7 million down approximately 34% when compared to the first quarter of 2008. The decline in demand continued to primarily be driven by recessionary conditions in the US and Europe. On the upside as I just mentioned, we had strong double-digit growth in China. In the first quarter of 2009, non-GAAP operating income in the E&C was $3.8 million or 3% of revenue compared to $37.9 million or 19.5% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008. The decline in operating margin was largely due to drop in revenue. We also had bad results of over $2 million primarily focused on one E&C dealer. First quarter 2009 Felid Solutions revenues was $99.2 million up 13% when compared to the first quarter of 2008. Strong sales of agricultural products particularly the newly introduced FMX integrated display and acquisitions grow Field Solutions growth. In the first quarter of 2009, non-GAAP operating income in Field Solutions was $42.4 million or 42.8% of revenue compared to $35.3 million or 40.1% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008. Growth in Field Solutions margin was driven by operating leverage resulting from increased revenue and product mix, with new products being in high gross margins. First quarter 2009 Mobile Solutions revenue was $38.3 million down approximately 13% when compared to the first quarter of 2008. The decline in revenue was primarily due to the fact that the first quarter of 2008 benefited from the completion of deliverables or two large contracts. Our pipeline remains strong and in the first quarter we announced two new deals with Windstream and DirectSat. In the first quarter of 2009, non-GAAP operating income in Mobile Solutions was $4.3 million or 11.2% of revenue up from $3.9 million or 8.8% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008. Improvement is primarily due to reduced operating expenses from operational efficiencies effected throughout the prior year. First quarter 2009 Advanced Devices revenue was $23.9 million down approximately 18% when compared to the first quarter of 2008. The decline in first quarter revenue was due to continuing slow sales of components which are sold to OEMs. In the first quarter of 2009, non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $4.6 million or 19.4% of revenue compared to $5 million or 17.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008. Margin improvement was result of increasing licensing revenue and product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2009 came in at $104.9 million compared to $107.7 million in the first quarter of 2008. The decline was primarily driven by headcount reduction and foreign exchange benefit partially offset by acquisitions. Non operating expense for the first quarter of 2009 was $656,000 versus $1.7 million of income in the first quarter of 2008, due primarily to decrease profitability from the joint ventures. We finished the first quarter of 2009 with $146.8 million in cash compared to $147.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. We have $151.6 million of debt flat with the balance in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our net cash position did not change despite using $43.3 million in acquisitions in the quarter due to the strong cash flow from operations. We did not repurchase any stock in the quarter. In the first quarter net accounts relievable was $220.4 million up from $204.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Day sales outstanding were 69 days flat with the previous quarter and down three days versus last year. While we had isolated issues with dealers the quality of receivables continues to be solid. Inventory was $165.4 million compared to $160.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, turns of our four times. Before we take questions let me give our guidance for Q2. For the second quarter of 2009, Trimble continues to see general uncertainty that limits their ability to provide precise guidance. We are guiding second quarter 2000 revenue in the range of $300 million plus or minus 5% at a point estimate of $300 million in revenue Trimble expect second quarter 2009 GAAP earnings per share of $0.21 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32. Non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of 2009 excludes amortization of intangibles of $13.3 million related to previous acquisitions and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of $4.1 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance use 27% tax rate and assume 121 million shares outstanding. With that I will turn the call over for your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And your first question comes from Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Hi good afternoon.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: My first question is on the E&P side of your business we have heard from several of the industrial companies that to recover that the sequentially trend seem to be I guess getting less negative or the sequential drop is less severe. I am curious if you are seeing that in your business, maybe moderating a little bit.
Raj Bahri: I think statistically it's hard to prove anything at this point in time in terms of the use of hard data. I think fourth quarter was exceptionally confused, I think the first quarter was less confused if that’s an indicator. But I think what is potentially encouraging as I said is that, lets call the anecdotes are comparatively less negative and in fact some of the anecdotes tend to be comparatively positive. And the anecdotes tend to revolve around the number of demos that are being given, if demos of product as well as quotes being issued. Now for the last six months those are not turned into orders and therefore they have not turned in to revenue. But in general the relative talk out there, the relative set of anecdotes that are being relayed verbally are not as negative as the numbers would say. So it's too early to actually point a data to say that what the trend is. But I would say the background chatter is not as negative as the numbers will be to imply.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay that’s helpful. In the Field Solutions side of your business it seems that the growth there runs contrary to what we been hearing from at least to a couple of your competitors. And I will be curious how much of the growth there was attributable to the acquisitions versus internal organic growth.
Raj Bahri: So actually if you look at the segment grew around 13% year-over-year and GIS business which is part of that actually did not have growth. So agriculture actually experienced more growth than the Field Solutions segments imply and I would say you know roughly half of the growth was organic and half of it was acquisitions.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay that’s great and my last question is on the expense side. R&D and sales and marketing expenses declined year-over-year but G&A was up so only what factors led to that increase and if we should continue to expect that?
Raj Bahri: So two factors. G&A will go down next quarter. The two factors were we had a bad debt I mentioned that we had a bad debt reserve of over $2 million focused on primarily one E&C dealer.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay
Raj Bahri: Last year we did not have that and acquisitions since the last year we acquired a few companies. Those are the two primary reasons and if you take those things out G&A was actually down on an organic basis.
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Great thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Hey, good afternoon. A couple of quick questions I think the first one is to do with your cost cutting that you have talked about in the quarter. You said you took cost reduction actions within the quarter and you are going to take additional steps if conditions require. Could you give us some color as to what the nature of the cost cuts were and on a go-forward basis whether there are going to be additional cost cuts at current business levels or business will have to deteriorate further for you to take additional cost cutting actions?
Steve Berglund: So I think in terms of the nature of the cost cuts you probably put a check mark by all of the typical categories. So January did involve a reduction in force, salaries are pretty much across the world, or at least wherever we can legally do it. Salaries are frozen at this point in time. There has been some level of encouraging people to take time off, depleting the implication accrual. And beyond that lets call moderate attempts to reduce travel. For example, on travel we are being less draconian than may be a lot of companies are from the standpoint that any travel, our travel that is out customer facing we were attempting to maintain, simply because we believe it's one thing we can do in this environment that maybe competitors can't do as much. So we are attempting the intelligent and focused in our cost cutting. But it's pretty much across the board from small things to large things. I think that the way we are managing through this is since we have a number of businesses in different conditions at this point in time. So, obviously Ag remains comparatively strong, E&C in a weaker condition is we are managing within the context of each of these businesses. So we are taking cost cutting actions. We are taking other actions as required within the context of each of these individual businesses. So, I think that we will continue to look at cost cutting actions within the context of the business. Many of the actions we launched in the first quarter won't be fully complete until into the second quarter, so we haven't seen the full effects of those yet. But again, I think that we will watch and see what's required, but I think the force in function, we are using to determine whether we are doing enough is whether we reestablished to trend back towards that 20% operating margin. We achieved the 12 month rolling operating margin of more than 20% for the first time in the quarter, ironically that ended in September. We wouldn't expect to get back to that let me take some time to get back to that particular level, but we will use that as the portion of function and we will look at each individual business within that context. So, we will continue it but not necessarily with across the board actions.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. So then on the investment line when you are looking at your expenses, you still have to see the full impact, but in gross margins you had one of the best gross margins you have had for the first quarter in a long time I think since 2002 on materially lower revenues. And usually going into the second quarter your gross margins are sequentially up. Are things going to be different this time and what sort of contributed to such a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis in gross margin?
Raj Bahri: Ajit, first of all there is no major pricing pressure on the margins I will start with that. And generally as we have done acquisitions and as our focus has been towards more and more software-oriented products. We have seen a general expansion of our gross margins overtime. And if you look at trend line it has slight there maybe one quarter here and there where you see the gross margins dip, but if you look at the trend line over the last three years or four years gross margins have slightly been keeping up over time just because the mix of products, higher software, higher subscription type of sales and absence of any pricing pressures. And coming to the Q2 it's too early to say our assumptions as we will be flattish in Q2 versus Q1.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Right, but the cost cutting that you talked about let's say pricing have stable, the cost cutting that you talked about is sort of equality split between cost of goods sold and the expense line, or is it centered in one category rather than the other?
Raj Bahri: It impacts both but it’s probably more towards OpEx line in terms of its weightage.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. And the acquisition that you talked about within the quarter and the once that you on a go forward bases, is it fair to assume just pays in the numbers that you gave that the majority of the acquisitions were in your Field Solutions business so was it less than 50%.
Raj Bahri: Well, all the material acquisitions were in the field service business now we did acquire QuickPen part way through the year which is in the E&C segment.
Ajit Pai – Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it, thank you.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham.
Rich Valera – Needham: Thank you, good afternoon. You made reference to an unusually favorable gross margin, I think operating margin here TFF division due to I think a higher percentage of new products and they carry higher margins. Do you think this is sustainable, due you think you will continue to see this higher mix of higher margin new products, you did think those margins might revert back more towards, more normalize mix going forward?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think it’s probably a fair statements say gross margins were favorable in he Field Solutions, but I think gross margin of that wasn’t exclusively, if deposited gross margin effect wasn't exclusively focused in the Field Solutions. I think obviously the operating margins in the Field Solutions segment were positive in the quarter. I think that it has more to do with the fact that revenue continuous to be strong and we are leveraging a relative fixed cost base, I would not attributed the majority of the positive effect to new products, I think that it has more to do with the underlying structure of the business but whether its sustainable or not we will see. Certainly our view is that we are it's a good time to be investing aggressively in agriculture; we are certainly reflecting that on the acquisition line with recent acquisitions. We are also stepping up the amount of R&D we are doing. So, I think in the longer-term it's probably not realistic to expect that will keep these operating margins in the Field Solution segments if nothing else there is going to some market arbitrage that goes on overtime but also I think that we are inclined to reinvest in the segment and make agriculture a bigger business than it is today.
Rich Valera – Needham: That’s helpful and in your earlier comments Steve, you talked sort of acknowledged that tractor sales were actually declining, I think the last couple of reported months they were down year-over-year. And generally I think someone else acknowledge your competitors, we are talking weakening backdrop in Ag. So if you look at the rest of the year do you see and you talk about potentially growing the business for the year do you see sort of decelerating year-over-year growth as the year progresses, that’s some of these sort of new headwinds taken to coming to effect or do you think you can maintain similar levels of growth as you saw in the first quarter?
Steve Berglund: Well, in this macro economy, it's hard to be certain about anything and all I can express is fair amount of humility in terms of what we may discover as the year goes on. I think first of all is that 2008 represented a remarkable for agriculture in terms of growth rate. So the comps throughout most of this year are just going to be extremely tough for Ag and very difficult to match. So I think I guess that context I think that it's going to be a difficult year just to do well against a spectacular 2008. Now having said that, I think the factors that are in play here is again this ROI premise is one we really do believe and as a company is that recession and say drop in heavy metal sales do not necessarily correlate totally to us, its easier to sell to an up market where farmers have lots of money and their spending it on tractors and pickups in our stop. But even in that context they may forgo the new pickup, they may forgo the new tractor. But we still have the ability to go in and basically sale cost savings that farmer and retrofit on the existing tractor. Again international markets which are comparatively in some cases green field opportunities for us remain available to us. So we still have an opportunity to go sell in places where we are not very well penetrated yet. And then again with the acquisitions and other internal development efforts we again have some comparatively Greenfield opportunities in agriculture where we have not played very much in the past. And all three of those factors I think come together to say that the outlook for agriculture certainly more positive than for E&C and we'll see to so much how much we can deliver on the top line in agriculture as the year unfolds.
Rich Valera – Needham: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Security.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: Good afternoon.
Raj Bahri: Good afternoon.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: Quick question, clarification, can you give us how much were of the sales in the first quarter were due to acquisitions and how much actually acquisitions, that was skip between the sectors?
Raj Bahri: Most of the acquisitions, let say it was in versus last year most of the stuff was in Ag there was some acquisitions in E&C space. And roughly acquisitions for the full year contributed roughly around one to two points of growth.
Steve Berglund: As I said, most of it was in Ag. Well, Ag was the only one that had up sales, and the sales were up of about 12% or something like that.
Raj Bahri: And I said half of the growth in the Field Solution was driven by organic and half of it was acquisitions.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: Yeah. And what about, whether how much revenue was there in E&C from acquisitions.
Raj Bahri: Very minor, Eli. I will get back to you, but it was very-very minor.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: Okay. And in your discussions earlier, you talked about, somebody asked you about the US market whether it's stabilizing or not. What are you seeing in Europe agricultural division particularly we are hearing Europe is in free flow. We are still on free flow. Are you seeing still very difficult conditions outside the US?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think Europe is multi part story. So certainly Spain, Ireland, Spain and Ireland in particular may be are comparatively get to the world at this point in time, the bubble was burst in both of those countries, have not recovered. I think Germany tends to be more of a question mark, there is competing data for what's really going on in Germany from our perspective, France somewhat in the same boat, Scandinavia and northern country us somewhat better. UK is a question mark but UK if looking beyond the current headlines may actually have some upsides of it. So I think that Europe is very much the next big and it's very hard to generalize, but clearly it was a not a good quarter for is in Europe. But I would not describe it generally in the freefall mode at this point in time.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: I guess, you indicated that North America was down 30% and Europe was down 30% which is equal as we look into the second quarter is it fair to assume that Europe will be weaker than North America at this point?
Steve Berglund: I think we said North America was down 13% Europe was down 30% so Europe was definitely kind of compared to the prior year was definitely more soft than the US.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: North America was down 13% I'm sorry then I'm sorry
Steve Berglund: Yeah.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: I apologize and then –
Steve Berglund: So we're not calling a base, we're not declaring that we found bottom we're not declaring that we found the base line anywhere yet. But with some help during the second quarter we actually start to find reestablish the base line in both places actually.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: If I go through your size in profitability on a GAAP basis just for a moment you find that you confidently allocated it had to a big number to get between with reports for operating income and your actually operating profit which applies at $27.8 million which is up sharply from $21 million is that’s where the restructuring stuff in.
Raj Bahri: Yeah, we have restructuring charges of $4.5 million. We had intangibles amortization which has increased because of acquisitions the total intangible amortization was $12.3 million of that 5.3 was in cost of goods sold and around $7 million was in operating expenses and then we had the regular items stock-based compensation of 4.2 and then those are the major items in doing that.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: And the tax rate was surprisingly lower than we expected as you pointed and it’s actually below what the 27% you forecasted in the second quarter is it something in the first quarter that dropped the tax rate down so much that is it repeatable or?
Raj Bahri: No, you know for the full year, I am still guiding at 27. We drop a couple of points drop because we had California; there is a change in the tax law which enables us to recognize some benefit which will impact Q1 only. So, for the rest of the three quarters, I am expecting it to be 27. Having said that, there is always going to be a variation of plus, minus, you know, a couple of points. Because, it depends upon the mix of profits. How much comes from international and how much comes in the U.S.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: Okay. One final question going back to the Ag business, so I guess, the idea is as you said, large equipment are still quite strong. But I expect to slower through the year. Is your sales in the Ag business you are seeing, going, you know, the big numbers, the big profitability, is it really to the customers, or is that provided.
Steve Berglund: I would say, it is still heavily, still weighted towards the end user in the after market, although, the factory installed business with the alliance with C&H is increasing as proportions, but is this still a multi-factor distribution solution? I would say it is still weighted towards the after market and going right to the end users.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Security: Okay. Thank you very much.
Steve Berglund: You bet.
Operator: Your next question is from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner – CIBC: Guys, good afternoon. First question, could you walk us through the linearity during the quarter, and I guess most, pointedly, have you seen any improvement in the month of April, seems it though. You know you said a lot of problem is right now is the sentiment uncertainty among your customers current potential, any sense that, you know, there is some confidence returning to the market?
Steve Berglund: Again I will be exceptionally careful here because as I said in the script that there anytime we have tried to apply in historical template or anytime we have attempt to deploy the any historical template to the last six months. It has been an exercise thought with uncertainty. So, I would say that in the first quarter we do not see the typical March end seasonal burst that we typically see from construction. So, the question is okay how much seasonality, how much of the seasonal boost will we see in terms of the second quarter in construction and survey. Now we had, I guess roughly three weeks of April which does not represent a whole lot of data to project from, but I would say in general is the first three weeks of April would be what I will be call reassuring the guidance that we given is not unreasonable. So, I would say is too soon to tell, but certainly the data from the first three weeks is for the moment reassuring one bad headline and that could change your course.
Yair Reiner – CIBC: Okay. Thanks for that. On the income from JV that dropped significantly quarter-on-quarter, I imagined that that has mostly to do with the restructuring of the agreement with Caterpillar or so maybe you could walk us through whether that's the case and if so where some of that income may have flown to?
Raj Bahri: So that's actually not the case. This is actually the old joint venture that is impacting. The new joint venture we actually consolidating in our results because we own 67% of the joint venture. So this is the old joint venture we had with the Caterpillar and the income there is much lower because the construction days are lot lower then Q1 of last year and that’s the primary driver of the reduction in the joint venture profitability.
Yair Reiner – CIBC: Very good and then I guess moving forward we should probably think of that is more of a base line that in the 2008 even the December 2008.
Raj Bahri: Yeah, as we to think that more as base line as we model the next few quarters maybe slightly up the seasonality in Q2.
Yair Reiner – CIBC: Okay, very good. The one final question, there is some indications that several of the credit markets for Ag not in the US internationally maybe seeing some pressure, to what extent are the purposes of your Ag equipment tied to credit in any of the markets internationally.
Steve Berglund: Well, directly, I would say not a whole lot of our price points are generally significantly lower then certainly the cost were attractive or even the cost of the pickup trucks. So I don’t think we are primarily dependant upon credits to finance what’s being bought for us the question is whether if on credit, it comes under pressure. It sets maybe a back drop and probably take this money flow up whether that has an effect on us in the secondary or not is the question but I would say is in the primary cases its not necessarily factor for us.
Yair Reiner – CIBC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Thanks very much (inaudible) from off a call. First half I guess we are just trying to get an update on a status of the new caterpillar JV, if you are seeing any of the anticipated benefits yet?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think there we’re seeing some benefits certainly things in terms of converting the distribution channel is moving slower than we anticipated six months ago when we establish it some way simply because principles as well as our own dealers are dealing with the situation that tends to grab a lot of mind share at this point. But I think the relationship the multi party relationship, the relationship between Trimble and Caterpillar and the new JV all of that is working quite well. I would say it's probably too soon to say that the JV itself. The new JV itself is producing results. There is still development we are going on that has yet to result in a new product. What I would say is that it is functioning. There have been any net surprises in terms of functioning of the new JV. I would say that there is what's call some early positives in the marketplace but I think we are probably operating on a six month like basis in terms of seeing the benefits. It's really the first six months we had some progress, we had some conversions. There is a lot of work in progress at this point in time. But we haven't seen the new distribution channel really established at this point of time but given the amount of work in progress at this point in time and let's call the heightened management focus on getting it done I think it's largely perspective. And there are number of anecdotes over the last few months that show progress but I did nothing really has effected the numbers in a big way.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Got it. Thanks. And then lastly, Raj, was there any impact top line or bottom line from FX this quarter?
Raj Bahri: Yeah, so, in a dollar debt strengthen versus last year. So we lost a little bit in revenue because of that and as you know on the operating income side we are pretty much hedged from operating expense point of view. So we did not have any impact much impact on the bottom line.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Got it, okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Corey Tobin with William Blair & Company.
Corey Tobin – William Blair & Company: Hi good afternoon, couple of things, let start in MCF we all have bad headlines and hearing stories and we are not but can you just give us a feeling of where are you actually seeing the strength out there who is buying are you seeing a more in survey, are you seeing in machine control, I mean is better to have lines are the numbers to me actually look relatively encouraging for work quarters can you just give us a bit of feeling for what is actually going on E&C?
Steve Berglund: Well, I think that in a general sense is there is category of buyers out there weathered be survey or construction that satisfy a couple conditions one those that have balance sheet and those that have cash flow and those that are let say have a strong set of management values relative to technology those are the characteristics in those companies whether they be construction or survey that I think are those that are buying at this point in time. And I think what will happen during this slowdown, particularly extends for any period of time, is that there is going to be relatively massive consolidation that occurs of the stronger players taking significantly increase market share and the weaker players, probably vanishing in one way or the other. So I would say if that is probably the driving profile here is that those have the financial strength and have the view that this is an opportunity, a period of opportunity. Those are the ones that, our customers at the moment. So again I probably have said in prior calls. I think one of the things that may actually occur in the slowdown again particularly if it lasts for a period of time. Is that the relative penetration of the technology in to the market place, whether it be construction and may be to a lesser extent survey. But certainly construction as the penetration rate may take a step function up during this time. Because the only way to survive this slowdown when the competitive intensity has ratcheted it up big time in terms of who is competing on jobs. And the number of players competing on jobs. It will be those players, those participants in that competition that are using the technology that will win and be able to survive. So I think it's more along that, so it does, yes tend to favor the bigger companies and I would say that probably is tending to be the bigger players that may be our customers during this period of time because they are able to continue investing during the downturn. But I think there is a significant consolidation that’s underway. And I think for us that tends to be a positive simply because those, that will end up winning their consolidation play customer for the technology.
Corey Tobin – William Blair & Company: Is it more on the survey side of a machine controller side? Do you have any sense for that, is roughly --
Steve Berglund: I think it's more evident on the construction side on the machine control side. Or for that matter this emerging category of BIM which does more relative construction of the building, surveyors tend to be more of a cash driven sort of animal as when they have a job they’ll go on buying new instruments now the same paradigm works but maybe a little less dramatically on the survey side. So I would say is the paradigm I just described is much more visible on the construction side.
Corey Tobin – William Blair & Company: Great. Should we shift in the channel for a second? In Q3, if I remember correctly, you had sort of mentioned that the dealer inventories were very thin in Q4 if I remember correctly there was some commentary that dealers might have sold down inventory and then they became thinner I guess. Where do feel that dealer inventories is today and we saw a lot of commentary on talking about dealers taking their inventory levels do you feel that the dealer inventory for your channel is appropriate at this point or is there risk that those bubbles come down and creeps up and hits you guys here in the latter part of the year.
Steve Berglund: So well, I think dealer inventories thinned down even more in the first quarter. We it’s a rough science but we've tracked the data and we believe that there was a further rundown of the inventory in the first quarter. Our overall sense is that they’re getting close to be close to bear minimum and dealers are not placing stock-in orders which was in effect we saw at the end of the first quarter because typically at the end of the first quarter we’re heading in the season in the E&C and what we see is a relative surge of stocking orders as dealers prepare to deal with the demand in the second quarter, that did not happen at the end of the first quarter which took some of the loss at the end of the quarter. But I think our overall sense was that dealer inventories are getting about as low as they can get is when they get order they place an order on us. So what I think, we were going to see from this point on is pure market demand. There probably won't be much of an inventory effect left. Now, my hope is that frankly we figure out a way to operate with the dealers at this lets say very thinned out inventory levels that we can become good enough, Trimble can be good enough, is that were, we are fast enough in delivery is that the dealers don’t have to rebuild this inventory. Because it would mean that we have taken significant out of the total dealer channel. But I don’t think there is a whole lot of inventory left out there to deplete off. So I wouldn’t expect any negative inventory effects of any magnitude for us as a company for the rest of the year. I think it is about as minimum as I can get at this point.
Corey Tobin – William Blair & Company: Great. And one more balance sheet question if I could. You know, the profitability stayed in E&C, I think it is an absolute dollars levels, it is running pretty close to mobile right now which given the revenue contribution is little bit surprising. So, just trying as best for the cost-cutting we saw in January and will you expect to see here a Q2. Do you think that there will be a significant pick up in margins here in the E&C segment in the second quarter?
Raj Bahri: Yes. So, E&C was impacted also by a bad debt write-off of $2 million and if you put that in the E&C margins double versus the reported numbers roughly. And then we also see a full quarter impact of the restructuring that took place in the first year and it was primarily focused on E&C. So, that will expand margins also. So, yes, in Q2 you should see a sequential improvement of E&C margins.
Corey Tobin – William Blair & Company: Great. And then trying impact of the balance sheets on the AR reserve, you mentioned the $2 million charge this quarter, how do you feel the rest of the AR looks at this point? Do you think you would see a need for additional one time items going forward here?
Raj Bahri: Couple of things there, we said it was primarily one dealer and then aging is fairly good for most of the dealers. Our DSOs were actually down versus last year same time by three days. So we will have isolated issues here and there but it's not a big problem.
Corey Tobin – William Blair & Company: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Evanson with Dougherty & Company.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Good afternoon, gentlemen. I guess I will start with my biggest question here. Steve, have you ever seen dealers not come in with striking orders at the end of Q1?
Steve Berglund: No, when I started up with script by saying we are in a non-precedent new territory here and serious is that what is happened in the last six, seven months has been a huge shock and we are seeing behavior that is not at all traditional. So, I've never seen that but I think that again this headline factor has got everybody spooked and cash preservation, cash conservation is at the top of everyone's list and that includes our dealers.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Terminal layout of scenario that I see potentially developing here in the construction market and I would like to get your response to what could unfold here? As contractors win bids for several ready stimulus projects. The only way they are going to make any kind of money on those thinly big projects is to increase their productivity, driving demand for machine control at a time when there is no inventory in the channel and you get slammed with orders in Q2, what is going to be your biggest constrain in responding to a potential surge in demand your response to my thesis and you answer that question please.
Steve Berglund: Why its certainly help you right Jeff, although personally I think that the shovel ready project scenario, will turn out to be less, it will turn out to be less shovel ready then and in the politicians actually said so I first not sure that there is a huge wave that’s going to break in second quarter on shovel ready products, I think projects, I think it will be in effect over the course of the year. So I am not sure that there was a tidal wave about to strike us in the second quarter and I hope you are right but I don’t think so, at the moment. But if we, but I think here at the beginning of your premise here is that certainly I think the winners will tend to be easing the technology because there is no other way to go into biding a job with probably two, three, four times as many competitors biding that job as you would have seen in the couple of years ago. So the only way to win that job is to pull out the sharpest expense that you can get and cut your estimate as opposed to the HSZ camp and the only way to do that is with the assurance that you got the technology behind. So certainly buying an instant interact part of the premise we will see whether there is a avalanche of shovel ready stuff that actually shows up in second quarter, but if it does, if we didn’t receive an out of orders I am pretty confident that we will be able to respond there is access capacity through the entire slight change. Considerably there might be some long lead items that would slow us down but whether it if it did occurrence second quarter some of it slopped over into the third quarter certainly within a couple of months we could gear up on, so whatever came. So, that gearing up like doesn’t worry me at all. Getting the orders is my primary concerned at the moment.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Right. So, judging is certainly judging the time and size of the rebound is difficult.
Steve Berglund: Right.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: But can you give us some anecdotal sense of how constructions firms are responding to an increase need for technology? And how it's impacting sentimental penetration out there? You mentioned clothes and demos are up. I would imagine that these construction firms now certainly the once I am talking to are really scrambling for how they are going to survive and they have got to cut cost to do that.
Steve Berglund: So, again I think constructed firms are definitely in a huge hunker down mode at this point in time and think they follow up fairly quickly in to the categories of those who balance sheet and manager retain some level flow minimizing the negative cash flow. And there are those that without much for balance sheet hedge and those that our operating without a balance sheet had you are probably to disappear in this environment. But I think the relative I think the contrast for 2001 or 2002 the last recession which payouts in comparison to what we’re going through at this point time but the difference between this go around and it was in 2001 and 2002 we were still and nearly a doctor pace with the technology. It was a not a survival issue. I think the technology truly is survival issue today and a contractor will not survive without the edge.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Contractor feel that way.
Steve Berglund: Yes, I think contractors feel that way, let me give you an anecdote so this year's Trimble's dimensions was held in February. Last year we had roughly 2004 people attending, this year we have slightly more actually an attendance than we had 15 months ago. So in spite of a hard recession that is just biding the cash flow these contractors, we had an equal attendance this year at our users' conference as we did at the last one, which I think is phenomenal and I think represents the absolute belief on the part of contractors as they have to pay current on the technology if they are going to survive. And I think that on a day-by-day basis in terms of what our dealers are saying in terms of their request for demos, their request for quotes a speculate quote I guess, is I think the thing we are pretty convinced up is that the penetration rate in the slowdown is going to go up significantly from what it was before the slowdown.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Okay. I am pretty disappointed on this SITECH update as I am sure you are, why is this taking so long and particularly I have be hard impressed taking the answer that it just the economy. What’s going on there?
Steve Berglund: But that’s the answer you are going to get Joe, I mean when a dealer, whether it would be a Trimble dealer or a Caterpillar dealer takes a huge drop in the revenue. Okay, so you look at the caterpillar machine sales as an indicator of what the dealers are seeing and their business model has just been absolutely trampled on really since the October-November timeframe mark. And so in terms of Mindshare [ph] on our dealer side and their dealer side the Mindshare is 100% focused on kind of current circumstances. And so believe me or not believe me but that is absolutely the only answer at this point in time. The level of enthusiasm for the SITECH concept with a couple of warrant cases [ph] out there obviously but by and large across the Caterpillar dealer network and across the Trimble dealer network the relative enthusiasm for SITECH is as strong as it ever was. But really what has impacted is an economic crisis that really has impacted a lot of people's business models in the short-term here.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: SITECH could help our profitability 200 basis points do you still see that happening?
Steve Berglund: Well, in terms of growth, I think it was revenue growth.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Yes, revenue, I am sorry.
Steve Berglund: I still see that happening, but again I've already talked to the in fact its probably going to occur on the three to six month late basis from what we thought it was going to be.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Okay. I'm going to presuppose something with this question, and ask you for the shorter list. I assume you are taking market share in most of your product categories. What product categories are you having less success with in the marketplace relative on a market share basis?
Steve Berglund: On a market share basis, I am not sure I got one for you. Certainly in the Mobile Solutions space, okay current circumstances favor us because we got the relative credibility of being bigger agricultural, don’t know precisely but I think maybe the competitors are suffering a little bit more than we are in this space. So as a matter let me tell we are probably doing fine in agriculture and then we get the E&C I think if you look at the competition and maybe after doing some forensic accounting that I don’t believe there is a single category of product where we were loosing share. Now some of these geographic regions are comparatively confused at this point in time in terms of size of the market. There could be some regional cases where I have to confess that maybe we are not doing as well as we would want, but I think there is a single product category that I would instantly throw up and say okay we are having market share difficulties without a doubt we have got categories where we were having difficulties but I am not sure market share difficulties is the current problem here.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Okay. And then two very quick questions to Raj and then I will shut up. Raj when do we anniversary the bulk of this Ag acquisition revenue. I put it at about $5 million to $6 million, is the quarter than anniversary in Q4?
Raj Bahri: Yes, we bought these acquisitions late in Q4. So really Q1 was the full impact so by Q4 we would have done the anniversary of these acquisitions.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Okay, great. And then what happened with the rest of the world. It’s just kind of an anomaly that revenue, that geography basically got almost cut in half year-over-year?
Steve Berglund: Yes, so I think maybe Raj has more precisely answer, but I think it’s probably nothing profound and nothing general but certainly cases like the Middle-East, Dubai has fallen on hard times. 2008 was in Dubai for example, was running exceptionally high. Dubai is obviously hot what it was a year ago. So, I think in some cornered cases like Dubai, now generally in terms of the rest of the world, the picture remains positive. I don’t think what you saw this quarter is necessarily the template for the next four quarters in terms of what we are going to see in the rest of world. We are seeing significant amounts of activity in places like Africa, and North or South Africa for example and the like. So, I think it is more a collection of cornered cases offered with comparatively small base that accounts for the rest of world. I would point specifically at Dubai, not necessarily the Emirates in total, but specifically Dubai as being one of the major factors where it was running exceptionally hard a year ago and then has fallen apart obviously since the. Raj, do you have anything to add?
Raj Bahri: No. I think that’s right.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: No more endorse key areas.
Steve Berglund: Not in the short-term anyway.
Jeff Evanson – Dougherty & Company: Thanks a lot.
Steve Berglund: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank. Mr. Goldberg, please go ahead.
Steve Berglund: I guess, we move on.
Operator: That question has been withdrawn. Your next question comes from Jeff Rath with Canaccord Adams.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Adams: Just two questions I will make them brief. I wonder if you could give some commentary around the regional strengths or weaknesses in your Field Solutions business as per from a geographic basis, obviously, you reported on a consolidated basis, any color you can give as far as strengths and weaknesses regionally. And then just a final one, is there a reason why the quarter would cut-off was April 3 versus I guess, this year and can you just explain that for me? Thanks.
Steve Berglund: Raj, you explained the quarter, can you explained the quarter thing.
Raj Bahri: Say that question again.
Steve Berglund: Was that April 3rd as oppose to a week earlier in March?
Raj Bahri: It was just driven by -- last year, it was a 53-week a year and year just started later this year. So, last calendar year which was 2008 was a 53 week year and basically we got us start later on in the year, so that's how the calendar dates are.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Adams: So effectively the revenue days are equivalent for this quarter?
Raj Bahri: Yes, absolutely.
Steve Berglund: It was a 13 week quarter.
Raj Bahri: It was 13 week quarter last year.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Adams: Okay. That's a simple answer. And any color you can give around the regional strengths and weakness in your Field Solutions?
Steve Berglund: No, I think when we talked about Field Solutions we have got GIS which tends to be heavy in the US or North America and Europe, most of the North America than Europe. And then with a relatively fast growing part in Asia particularly China, but I don’t think there was anything unusual in terms of the GIS split per se. Now agricultural tends to be heavy North America, heavy Australia, heavy Brazil so now increasingly heavy Europe. And so I would say is that, I am not sure that there were any large geographic discontinuities in Ag. I would say Europe is probably at the moment doing comparatively better than the other parts of the world, but I don’t know there was any kind of discontinuity or any real break with the prior quarters.
Jeff Rath – Canaccord Adams: Okay, thanks very much.
Steve Berglund: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan Securities.
Scott Sutherland – Wedbush Morgan Securities: Firstly a quick one for Raj, in your cost cut maybe how much of we have seen so far in Q1 and how much more should we see in Q2, have you seen about two-thirds or half those cuts so far.
Raj Bahri: We probably have seen slightly less than half in Q1.
Scott Sutherland – Wedbush Morgan Securities:
 :
Steve Berglund: What I think Ag is clearly, we are clearly an investment mode at this point in time. We are actually in the process of redeploying resources from elsewhere in the company to Ag as being the best opportunity or one of the best opportunities for us in the next 12 to 18 months. So I would say an Ag is clearly from an acquisition side we have shown an increased appetite for acquisitions in Ag but then also in terms of internal development we are clearly in an investment mode in Ag and I would expect that to continue.
Scott Sutherland – Wedbush Morgan Securities: (inaudible) questions ago, talking about productivity gains of your technology. You are check strength only a lot different, US stimulus is nice but small and I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that China is really driving natural esteems for more derive what is there openness to your technology and buying your technology and how much relative you think that could be.
Steve Berglund: Well, again, I think looking at the next 12 to 18 months is certainly the Chinese stimulus package is going to be much more effective then anybody else’s. They announced in the next day they were implementing, but I think China for us is historically been more of a survey instrument market in terms of the bulk of the sales been on the survey side than on the construction side. So, we will continue to rise the way on the survey side, in terms of selling survey instruments, but I think the construction side represents more or less of a pure up side from a relative small number of year or two ago. We have I think substantial opportunity in China to penetrate the market. And I would say the receptivity to the technology in China is no less than as intense elsewhere in the world and in some cases maybe even more intense. I think they are very much driven by the idea that they have the opportunity to skip technology generations in China. And I think you see that in a number of different phases within China. And I think that the Chinese are very interested in applying the new technology. Now, the rational the justification maybe a bit different in China then in Iowa or somewhere, labor productivity per se isn't necessarily the driver because again the cost of labor is down. But certainly when it comes to quality and rework issues those tend to come right to the top of the list of things are used to justify the technology. So, I would say is the enthusiasm is generally high. There maybe at times say in education effort required like say the enthusiasm is high and we would expect the next five years to be actually a very good period for us in construction in China.
Scott Sutherland – Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay. And my last question is kind of to just understand your comments about how this tracks, maybe it is getting less back. Your overall guidance at a midpoint implies that year-over-year you are down worse in Q2 then you were in Q1 and Q2 is typically seasonally strong. I kind of understand that guidance in light of the fact that you are making kind of comments things are maybe stabilize again less bad. Are we reading that right or being a little bit cautious on guidance.
Steve Berglund: Okay, first of all, our three weeks into the quarter or 13 weeks and does has historically been a seasonally high quarter for us. So, we have learned to be cautious about applying historical patterns here. And I think the phrasing I used was the first three weeks have been reassuring relative to forecast we put out there. So, we are definitely not calling the bottom or definitely not calling a new base line here. But I think we will see how the quarter unfolds, but I would say is that anecdotes are positive first three weeks of data is reassuring I will see what all that means in another 10 weeks or so.
Scott Sutherland – Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Steve Berglund: Okay.
Operator: Your last question comes from Alex Blanton with Ingalls & Snyder.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: Hi, good afternoon. On that point you mentioned that the dealer or distributor inventories are down to practically nothing which means that they have been reduced over a period of time. So, that if sales were flat which you are saying they could be quarter-over-quarter and the second quarter. When that mean that the end market demand would actually have to be down, because if end market demand were flat you would have to raise your production in order because there would be the lack of the inventory reduction of prior periods.
Steve Berglund: You maybe have an arithmetically intern like consistent case here.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: If your sales in the first quarter were depressed by dealer inventory reduction, but now in the second quarter the dealers can't reduce inventory any further your sales would have to go up when they have if demand were flat.
Steve Berglund: Alex you are assuming that the first quarter inventory effect was material I didn’t say that it was material.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: Well, you didn’t -- I know you didn’t. You said that there was no inventory left. So I assume that some point it had to go.
Steve Berglund: No, I didn’t say that there was no inventory left; I said that the inventories tend to be on a minimal level. And there is inventory in the channels.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: Yes.
Steve Berglund: First of all its not necessarily in the first quarter, fourth quarter was a more material effect, first quarter was less, I am not declaring it to be material so therefore I think that.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: Okay, so you didn’t really reduce inventory while in the first quarter.
Steve Berglund: We did reduce inventory, I am just not saying it’s a material number and in terms of your analysis.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: Got it. Okay. Secondly, in terms of if demand were to pick up, most of your production is done by a contract manufacturers. Is that correct (inaudible)?
Steve Berglund: Yes.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: And they are very-very flexible as name implies. And so they could pick up production fairly quickly. They have got a huge supply chain and much more so than you could have on your own. Which of course, is the one reason that Trimble when it was, well with their predecessor which Flextronics acquired. But that was one reason for doing that that they have the resources to really flex the production pretty rapidly, don't they?
Steve Berglund: Yes, so as I told Jeff, is if we need to ramp up, ramping up is not one of my principle concerns at the moment.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: Right.
Steve Berglund: So, I think that there’s enough flex in the supply chain that we can handle anything that comes at us.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder: Okay, thank you.
Steve Berglund: Okay.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Gentlemen, are there any closing remarks?
Steve Berglund: No closing remarks. Talk to you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

 : 
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Julianne and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2008 Conference Call and webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.  Ms. McManmon, you may begin.
Willa McManmon:  Thank you. And thank you for joining us today. I would like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. The words intend, expect, plan or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. Important factors relating to our business including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are described in our Form 10-Q, 10-K and other filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes and assumptions or other factors. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Berglund:  Good afternoon. In today's call, we will continue to use the word unprecedented to describe our environment. As a company, we have never seen a change abrupt as the one that has occurred in our E&C market since early September. The first break came in mid-September when demand dropped as a result of the meltdown in the financial markets. While, we believe we had built that change into our fourth quarter guidance, the market further retreated in November, and we did not see the typical E&C surge in December. Total year 2008 really consisted of two distinct periods. The first nine-months were recession conditions and difficult. But even under those conditions, we were able to generate a year-to-year revenue growth of 17%. Non-GAAP operating income growth of 22% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 34%. The short break in the fourth quarter represented a major loss of confidence by businesses, which constitute our primary customer base. This resulted in businesses across the US and Europe cutting back dramatically on investments. In practical terms, the E&C market has shutdown rationale decision making, while awaiting events. At this point we do not have a template to apply and it is not possible for us to reliably forecast the E&C market. Whatever the market conditions, our approach as a company during this period of uncertainty will be based on five tough time tasks. The first task is to strive to maintain our operating margin as a percentage of revenue. Our model was pounded in the fourth quarter and we have taken actions to recover. The primary negative impacts in the fourth quarter were the obvious effect of the revenue decline, product mix and some one-time write-offs.  Fortunately, we are not seeing systemic pricing declines although some markets have become more fierce on a case-by-case basis. Our recovery path is to focus each of our businesses on aligning revenue and cost. The cost cuts we made in January were based on our best judgment at that time. However, with the volatility and the E&C demand and the resulting inability to establish a re-viable base line expectation, we will need to react to any further changes in outlook. A key question facing us during the duration of the slowdown which is currently impossible to judge, the judgment were that we may see recovery by the first-half of 2010, we would respond differently on our cost cutting efforts and if we expect it to see difficult times extend out for several years.  The second task is to utilize this period of uncertainty as an opportunity to improve our competitive position. Although this will be a painful period for us, we believe we bring significant competitive strengths into the downturn. We have a robust financial model that should stand up relatively well. We have no net debt that will encumber our decision making. We have an organization that is more capable than ever before. And we have a product portfolio that will strengthen in the next year.  In most of our markets these attributes should provide us competitive advantage. Although we have little appetite to increase our debt load until we have better market in sight, we are currently prepared to invest our operating cash flow in pursuit of improving our competitive position. We demonstrated this willingness in the fourth quarter with 8 small acquisitions or companies, technology and products to extend our capabilities and market reach. The third task is to anticipate and prepare for the inflection point. Although the turnaround for this slowdown may take a different from than it did in 2002, what we saw then was a substantial and sharp improvement in outlook in the second half of 2002 that set the foundation for six years of uninterrupted revenue and profit growth.  It will be important for us to anticipate and recognize the transition when it comes and be prepared to accelerate out of this downturn. Our management challenge will be to confine a short-term focus on cost management together with a refusal to engage in bunker mentality on the long-term market prospects. When we do emerge we expect our current cost containment actions will allow us to demonstrate significant operating leverage just as we did following the 2001 and 2002 slowdown.  The forecast will be to take advantage of those of our business that still have growth potential in this environment. Although E&C have seen a significant deterioration in market conditions it is not clear that field solutions and mobile solutions will reflect the same degree of degradation.  Although our approach has grown significantly more humble in the last three months we continue to see possibilities for positive scenarios both within elements of E&C as well as the non-E&C businesses. Agricultural grew in double-digits in the fourth quarter and although there is a degree of general nervousness about agriculture. It appears that financing today agricultural sector remains adequate. It is too early and seasonally high first quarter to fully understand how the cumulative economic impacts will affect demand for Trimble agricultural products, but the early evidence provides some reasons for guided optimism.  In the Mobile Solutions segment we have been talking for the last six months about an improving orders pipeline. Although the economy has caused some deferrals of business we had expected that the pipeline continues to be robust against historical standards. In this case, we expect to prove the hypothesis that we can walk into a fleet manager's office during a recession and make the case for an intermediate reduction of upto 20% at fuel cost and improvement of upto 20% in capital utilization. For those companies managing fleets or mobile workforce that have balance sheet sufficient for them to make advantage business decisions, this is the salable proposition even in the middle of a recession. Our E&C scenario is consistent, when some level of confidence has been restored and the participants in E&C market regain some ability to predict their business, we believe which make the ROI sale. Although we have been impacted in the last four months by the refusal of businesses to consider any investment, we do have the relative advantage of selling productivity not capacity. This will enable us to seek our targeted growth opportunities within the E&C market even within a recession.  The single largest current opportunity is China. While we are awaiting details of US stimulus package and did not expect to see any serious benefit from it in 2009, but Chinese are taking significant actions now to spend large amounts of money on infrastructure in 2009 and 2010. Published accounts are identified over $500 billion of proposed spending through airways, highways air force and utilities. Beyond China, most of our international markets outside the US and Europe remain generally positive if more problematic, but this task is that despite a focus on cost cutting we continue to aggressively prepare the footprint for a larger future Trimble. During the 18 month period of 2001 and first half of 2002 we experienced nine-months recessionary conditions they were further intensified by nine-months of decision making per analysis after 9/11. Although the conditions were difficult during an interval we were able to progress by establishing new businesses and expanding existing business. For example, the foundations of what later become our Mobile Solution segment and our new joint virtual side venture with Caterpillar was established in 2001. The mechanisms for doing this will be the continued launch of new products and product categories, judicious use of acquisitions and the leverage of new alliances. In particular, we are re-deploying resources from US and Europe and reassigning them to other regions that have better short-term and longer term prospects. We continue to believe that our own new initiatives have the potential to benefit both our short-term as well as long-term performance. We have previously described the benefits of the new SITECH distribution channel, our new GeoSpatial initiative, our BIM initiative and a number of new product categories. These all represent new revenue streams that have the potential to benefit results, starting in 2009. In summary, we have now particularly advantaged inside into either 2009 or 2010. We will take conditions as they come and react proportionately. We remain largely a book and bill business with comparatively small recurring and backlog revenues. Our forecasting typically consists of taking hundreds of points being put from our channel and matching them to our historical experience. In this environment, that process has become unreliable, whereas in early September we anticipate a recessionary conditions in 2009, but believe we had an operational plan that would enable us to demonstrate reasonable growth. The suddenness and debt of the falloff in the last three or four months has put that judgment on hold at least until the second half of this year. Our planning assumption for the year are that the first quarter will continue to reflect the confusion of the fourth quarter, but the second quarter will begin the transition to more rationale decision making. And the second half of the year will reflect difficult recession conditions, but one in which we can begin to market our ROI message. We will manage through the recession as flexibly and opportunistically as we can while anticipating the inflexion point, and we can resume our corporate progression. Let me now turn the call over to Raj.
Raj Bahri: Good afternoon. In the fourth quarter of 2008 revenue was $268.1 million down approximately 14% versus revenue of $312.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full-year revenue was $1.3 billion up approximately 9% from revenue of $1.2 billion in 2007.  Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $10.4 million down approximately 73% from the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2008 were 3.9% compared to 12.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007. Full-year operating income of $185.5 million was up approximately 4% from 2007 and operating income margins were 14% compared to 14.6% in 2007.  Excluding amortization of intangibles, stock based compensation expense, restructuring expense and inventory step-up charges related to acquisitions, non-GAAP operating income of $28.7 million was down 46% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating margins were 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008 down from 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007. The reduction in margins was primarily due to loss of leverage in manufacturing overhead and operating expenses as a result of decline in revenue versus prior year. In the first quarter we are taking additional cost cutting actions to reduce expenses and improve the financial model.  For 2008, non-GAAP operating income was $252.6 million up approximately 7% compared to 2007. Non-GAAP operating margins were 19% flat when compared to 2007. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $13.7 million, down 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $0.11 compared to $0.21 in the fourth quarter of 2007. Full-year net income was $141.5 million up 21% compared to 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 were $1.40 up $0.20 when compared to 2007.  The tax rate for 2008 was 26% as compared to 36% in 2007 due primarily to a reduction in tax-rate driven by a global supply chain target. In the fourth quarter, Trimble booked a tax benefit resulting from the October 2008 federal R&D credit, retroactive legislation and a lower full-year tax rate due to the geographical mix of revenue.  Adjusting for the items noted above, non-GAAP net income of $28.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 was down 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $0.24 down 14% from non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28 in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the year excluding in-process, research and development, non-GAAP net income of $109.9 million was up 23% compared to 2007, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 for 2008 were up $0.29 compared to 2007.  By geography, in the fourth quarter 55% of the revenue was in North America, 24% in Europe, 14% in Asia Pacific and 7% in the rest of the world. For the full-year 54% of revenue was in North America, 25% in Europe, 14% in Asia Pacific and 7% in rest of the world. Year-over-year revenue by region grew 6% in North America, 2% in Europe, 25% in Asia-Pacific and 30% in rest of the world.  Now, I will cover the results by segment on underlying non-GAAP basis. Engineering and Construction revenue was $142.6 million down approximately 24% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, while we had expected the E&C environment to be challenging we were surprised by the extent of the slowdown particularly in December which tends to be a stronger month for us. In addition, to very slow orders from the end users, many dealers would normally hold some stocking inventory depleted their stock and did not replace it in an effort to conserve cash.  For 2008 E&C revenue was down less than 1% to $741.7 million. The decline is largely due to the impact of the E&C revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter. For the first nine-months of 2008, E&C demonstrated 7.6% revenue growth over the first nine-months of 2007. Fourth quarter 2008 non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $3.9 million or 2.7% of revenue compared to $37.9 million or 20.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full-year E&C non-GAAP operating income was $130.7 million or 17.6% of revenue compared to 23.9% of revenue in 2007. The decline in income came about primarily due to the significant decline in revenue and some product mix, which was most marked in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2008 Field Solutions revenue was $58.2 million, up 17.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. For the year 2008 extremely strong sales of agricultural products build revenue of $300.7 million, growth of 50% over 2007.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income in TFS was $17.7 million or 30.5% of revenue compared to 28.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007. For 2008, non-GAAP operating income in TFS was $110.3 million or 36.7% of revenue, up from 30.8% of revenue in 2007. As has been the case throughout 2008, operating margin expansion came from operating leverage, resulting from increased revenue as well as improvement in product cost. Mobile Solution's fourth quarter 2008 revenue was $40 million, down approximately 16% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The fourth quarter of 2007 benefited from the completion of deliverables for two large contracts. The good news is that actual bookings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were up almost 20% over the fourth quarter of 2007. For 2008, Mobile Solution revenue was $167.1 million, up approximately 6% compared to 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in TMS was $4.5 million or 11.2% of revenues compared to $7 million or 14.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007. As mentioned previously, the fourth quarter of 2007 margins benefited from the completion of the deliverables for two large contracts. In 2008, Mobile Solution's non-GAAP operating income was $16.1 million or 9.6% of revenue, compared to operating income of $17.5 million or 11.1% of revenue in 2007. As we have discussed in our last two calls, the decline in margins is primarily due to the increased R&D and sales expenses for our new Field Service software, partially offset by an over reduction in other operating expenses. As we mentioned earlier, the pipeline for this business remains relatively solid. Advanced Devices revenue was $27.2 million down about 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2007. The decline was primarily due to slow sales of our Component Technologies products which we sell through OEMs. 2008 Advanced Devices revenue was $119.7 million, down approximately 1% compared to 2007.  Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $6.7 million or 24.7% of revenue compared to 14% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007. For 2008, Advanced Devices non-GAAP operating income was $25.8 million or 21.6% of revenue compared to 15.4% of revenue in 2007.  For both the quarter and the full-year, improvements in operating margins were due to product mix and increased licensing revenue.  Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 came in at $111.6 million or 41.6% of revenue compared to $116.4 million or 37.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007. Although operating expenses in the fourth quarter declined versus prior year this was clearly not enough to offset the margin loss associated with the 14% decline in revenue. Hence, we are further reducing headcount in the first quarter of 2009 bringing total cumulative headcount reductions since April '08 to approximately 10% excluding acquisitions. The full savings on these reductions will be realized in the second quarter of 2009.  Non-operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $951,000 versus a $1.3 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to losses on the deferred compensation plan and increased interest expense. We finished the fourth quarter of 2008 with $147.5 million in cash compared to $70.5 million in the third quarter of 2008. We have $151 million of debt compared to $51 million in the third quarter of 2008.  The decline in the net cash position was driven by eight acquisitions of companies, technologies and assets in the fourth quarter and $10 million stock buyback in the quarter.  In the fourth quarter we generated $34.0 million in cash flow from operations. In the future we expect to fund acquisitions with our operating cash flow which continues to be comparatively strong.  In the fourth quarter, net accounts receivable was $204.3 million down from $257.5 million in the third quarter of 2008. Day sales outstanding were 69 days down 2 days versus third quarter of 2008. Although we have a couple of specific delay issues for which we wrote-off approximately $2 million of recoverable in the fourth quarter, the overall quality of our accounts receivables continues to be very good.  Inventory was $160.9 million compared to $162 million in the third quarter of 2008. Turns were four times. Guidance for the first quarter of 2009 is the most difficult we have given as a company in some time, because of the limited visibility we will not be giving full-year guidance other than the qualitative guidance that Steve has provided.  We are assuming that the fourth quarter market uncertainty will continue into the first quarter. Our current estimate for the first quarter of 2009 revenue is $300 million. However, given the volatility of market conditions we believe this revenue estimate could vary plus or minus 5%.  Using a $300 million revenue estimate first quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share projected to be $0.12 and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be $0.27. Non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of 2009 excludes amortization of intangibles of $14.2 million related to previous acquisitions, the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million and $5.5 million in restructuring charges. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance use a 28% tax rate and assume 122 million shares outstanding.  With that I will turn the call over for your questions. Thank you.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Rich Valera - Needham & Company: Thank you. Good afternoon gentlemen. Raj with respect to the cost cuts that sounds like that will be fully faced in the second quarter. Can you give us an estimated non-GAAP operating expense number that you expect to see, can you give us that kind of granularity?
Raj Bahri: Well, it gets driven by because this is excluding acquisitions and we did quite a few acquisitions in Q4. So net-net what I can tell you is, we can expect to see for 2009 savings of around $25 million from these costs cutting efforts versus 2008.
Rich Valera - Needham & Company: And that’s not linear obviously because you wouldn’t really see the impact fully in the first quarter?
Raj Bahri: One and half month impact in Q1 and then we will see the full quarter impact starting in Q2.
Rich Valera - Needham & Company: Okay. And those predominately effect operating expense as opposed to gross margin, is that correct?
Raj Bahri: One of the things that got us in Q4 was that we have some manufacturing costs that are fixed in nature, and we did take some actions to reduce that as well. So part of it, it will be reflected in gross margin.
Rich Valera - Needham & Company: Great. And then Steve just one question on sort of the bigger picture, on Caterpillars call there was a discussion about sort of almost [idle] capacity that creeps into the system as you have [idle] used equipment, that sort of ends up taking up some of the capacity once the demand returns, so there is kind of delay in the purchase of new equipment as demand returns. Do you think that concept applies to any parts of your business, and if so where?
Steve Berglund:  Actually, maybe there are probabilities in some corner case, some cornered cases would apply, but in general, I would say is the scenario that we are looking at given that the market is still very much un-penetrated. Pretty much across all of our businesses whether it would be E&C, machine control, or certainly the new connect-to-site stuff, but agriculture, as well as the Mobile Solution stuff. I think the scenario that we contemplate is walking onto a contractors yard and walking into the contractors office and basically saying , yes on the way end we observed that 50% of your fleet is parked outside, which represents idle capacity. Now the qualification there is that machines maybe parked for three day, but because of special used machines, it may not be parked permanently. But aside from that is we can walk into a contractors office, say, yes, we observed that 50% of your fleet or whatever the number is, hopefully it is not 50%, but 50% of your fleet is parked outside not necessarily delivering value at this point in time. But lets talk about the 50% of the fleet that is being used and the productivity we can bring we can make it more productive, and I guess, conceivably allow you to park another 10% of your fleet outside and get the same amount of work out of the 40%.  So, I think given that the market is un-penetrated and large elements of the fleet, in terms of construction machine control, for example, it would be well more than 80% of the fleet, capacity out there still doesn’t have machine control, our machine control on it. As we have the ability to basically sell into the part of the fleet that isn’t excess. So I think that the paradigm here should play out differently than it looks like from our machine manufacturers’ perspective.
Rich Valera - Needham & Company: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you. 
Steve Berglund: You bet. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Corey Toben with William Blair & Company. 
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company :  Hi good afternoon. Steve let me ask if I could, some clarification on some of the prepared remarks. I will stay outside of E&C for now? Can you just give a little bit of clarification on what you mean by Ag and I think you said there is early evidence this year provide some reason for cautious optimism. Can you give us a few examples of what you were referring to on that point?
Steve Berglund: Okay, so we are caught a third of the way through the first quarter at this point in time, so this is the heavy seasonal quarter for Ag. Clearly at the end of the fourth quarter everybody I think was, including the farmers, including the distribution channel was kind of viewing the world with extreme caution and not prepared to spend cash.  So, I think that based on both what we are seeing in terms of orders as well as anecdotes. We had an agricultural dealer meeting week before last that I attended and from an anecdotal level there is actually quite a bit of confidence out there. So, I think that based on what we have seen through the first month of the quarter based on orders in-take as well as let’s call the anecdotes that are running around out there. What we are not seeing is the same level of doom and gloom that you will see in the construction ramp.  So I think, it will be whether we can produce the numbers or not but I think at this point in time we are again kind of what I say guardedly optimistic just based on what we have seen through the first month. There are two months left in the quarter, those are going to be pivotal, but at this point in time we are not feeling badly about what we are seeing let me put it that way. 
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company : And then shifting gears a little bit, outside of domestic E&C market, I think it fits along the lines of most markets outside of the United States and Europe. The decision making is slow but there are still being decision made there. Did I hear that correctly? Can you just give little more color on that around? 
Steve Berglund: Yes. So when we look at around the world, again I don’t want to overplay this because the economic facts that we are seeing are global. There are waves wondering crashing through the world at one point or another. So I think that I am not necessarily projecting a strong sense of optimism here but trying to just portray the market as we see it today.  So if you look at Africa, if you look at the Middle East, if you look at India, if you look at China, if you look at Russia, kind of different scenarios in each case but not swayed on their back, not kind of dealing with the same level of fear, uncertainty and doubt that the US and Europe are displaying at this point time. So I think, yes there are some projects that maybe in doubt particularly in the Middle East as oil revenues come down. But at the same time we are still talking about some upside scenarios around that part of the world and particularly in China. I think the Chinese government made the assessment that as their export businesses slowdown because of world wide economic conditions they have compensated to maintain employment by pushing a lot of money in infrastructure and that money is being spent now.  So, I think that we are still comparatively bullish on China expecting actually a good year in 2009 a strong growth year in 2009 out of China and then in the other places again to continue or more still looking for growth out of most of those geographies.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company : Got it. And last one I will jump back in queue. On the stock buyback plan at this point what’s the current thought given the cash and debt positions with respect to stock buyback. Is your plan to slowdown a little bit or do you accelerate given the current stock price, thanks?
Steve Berglund: I will jump in and just saying until we get a hand along things, I think our view is that we got better alternative uses for cash at this point in time then to engage in any additional repurchasing of stock.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company : Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank. 
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: Hi, none of our economist, we don’t really know what’s going to happen with the economy, but I just want to get your thoughts on what happens, how would you approach business, we get sort of the average of the year and it doesn’t look like recoveries are coming, what do you think you will be doing then?
Steve Berglund: Okay, well, I can refer to that or try to refer to that scenario in the script, I think what we are trying to figure out at this point in time is not being economist ourselves and not relying on economist at this point in time then anybody much good. But I think we are trying to figure out the scenario. So, clearly if we saw a probability of relatively early recovery, and whether it is the stimulus package or the credit markets coming back or whatever, but if we saw what we would call the inflection point occurring say in early 2010, I think our whole view as a company would be, okay, we take deliberate steps to reduce our costs at this point in time. But we keep in mind that what we are looking for is that inflection point and if we actually believe the inflection point will be relatively early. I think we take one approach on cost, which is to make sure we preserve capability. Now, yes, we get deeper into the year and this looks like a three year or four year sort of malaise situation. Again then I think our view would be, okay, to be responsible stewards we have to look at fundamentally restructuring ourselves differently for the long-term and I think we would be taking a different perspective on what our portfolio of businesses is and how we would run them. And they would probably be the judgment that we couldn’t afford to some of the things we would otherwise wanted to do. So, I think again our view is one way or the other we will react and we will react in responsible fashion, but I think at this point in time, we don’t have a clear view as to whether this is a 2009 in and out scenario or whether this lingers on in some fashion but I think either way, we are prepared to flex appropriately.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: Do you think you would be seeing opportunities at some point in the cycle to start consolidating gains against your competitors, maybe pick up some of the smaller ones?
Steve Berglund: Yes. And I think, the unnecessarily buying of competitors, but I think more along the lines of consolidating market space and you saw us doing that in the fourth quarter to some extent. We extended our agricultural line in the fourth quarter by buying a true count in Ross and expanding farther into the agricultural ground. And I think you would see us doing that more than anything else which is kind of solidifying market territory that we already occupy or maybe extending our reach, because again if you look at the competitive mix out there with a couple of exceptions is we are relative to balance sheet, relative to market position, we believe we have advantage in a number of cases and I think that we can to be honest is the slowdown is maybe a major opportunity for us on a strategic scale. And I think that while being responsible in terms of financial storage shift is we believe we can take advantage of this opportunity to kind of both solidify and expand our market position. 
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: Alright that is a little more accurate. Thank you. 
Steve Berglund: Yeah. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer. 
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer:  Yes, thank you, and good afternoon. I just want to ask you a question about the new JV with Caterpillar as I recall that really hinged on getting the Caterpillar franchise to invest more in your independent channel. Given some of the challenges that I imagine they too are facing, how is that shaping up and how do now view the kind of investment you will need to make in that channel over the course of 2009?
Steve Berglund: So without a doubt we announced the deal in early October and the world fundamentally looks a bit different than it did in early October. And certainly a number of Caterpillar dealers are certainly more challenged now than they were at that point in time. But I think the practical issues here are more a matter of timing than necessarily of intent or ultimate conclusion. So I think the efforts continue. We are planning to create a number of new SITECH distribution outlets during the next quarter and certainly a lot much larger number during the course of the year. I think the confusion interest the market place has caused everyone to become a bit more, well this is what’s matter of cautious than let's say they are preoccupied. So our time table may be slipped a little bit, but the over one to two year period the result will end up being the same. So the optimism and the expectations remains absolutely the same.  In terms of investment, the expectation in terms of creating the new channel per se it remains the same which is if the new channel will effectively involve zero investment by Trimble. So, the Caterpillar dealer, or the Caterpillar dealer principles there would be actually the participants are well capitalized and they have the capability of doing this without any Trimble involvement. So, in terms of the distribution channel we don’t expect any net investment from Trimble.  Now when it comes to the new joint venture itself and the supporting operations of Trimble, here’s probably the one case in the company, I believe this was the only case in the company when I talked about kind of cutting to size and being proportional in our response to revenues. Here is the case where I think that we will continue to invest as we originally expected because we think the opportunities is at longer term justifies it. But again that remains fundamentally unchanged.  And so I would say net-net in terms outlook both strategically lets call with 12 to 18 month contracts nothing has really changed since the early October. But I believe the first six months may be a bit slower than we had expected.  
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer:  Okay, thank you. In terms of debt, so you added another $100 million or so debt in the quarter, if you could just give us some insights about the terms of the debt when it's due? And there something you want to think about paying down in the coming quarters or do you feel comfortable with this level of debt moving forward for the next few quarters?
Raj Bahri:  Sure, Yair this is Raj. We have around $155 million debt and we have around $150 million of cash. So, from our net position we don’t have that much debt on our balance sheet. And the terms on this debt are very payable. It's basically LIBOR plus 65 basis points. So, I am paying around 1%, 1.5% interest on this. It's under a revolver agreement where we can take out $300 million and that agreement is in place for another three year. So, we took cash in just because what was happening in Q4 around the financial conditions and we did have an acquisition pipeline. So, it was little bit of safety kind of thing because knowing we didn’t want to slowdown in acquisitions we pulled some cash in, but net-net we don’t have any debt and whatever we have we don’t pay too much interest on it.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer:  Got it. One final financial question and then I will get back into queue. I saw inventories were up a bit in a quarter both in absolute terms and in terms of days, should we expect that two weigh on margins again next quarter and US can write-off there and just let us know how we should think about that?  
Raj Bahri:  Sure. Our inventories basically even if you look versus last year, our inventories went up by $17 million. Of that $11 million of that was acquisitions, so buy companies and they inventories and the remaining of $5 million or so was as we deferred revenue we have to differ cogs. So as deferred revenue built up we had to defer the cost. So those are the two things that rolled the absolute dollars up. On the underlying basis their inventories were relatively flat.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer:  Got it. Thank you very much.
Steve Berglund:
 : And for me this is an aside and I am not foreshadowing anything per se, but just putting a marker in for the next quarter or two. What relative inventory is certainly in this time of financial uncertainty, everybody looks for accounts receivable sorts of risks, but I think there is also the need to look to the supply chain as a source of risk in terms of unexpected difficulties in the supply chain. So, it would be perfectly logical and perfectly comprehensible on our part maybe to build some safety stock against those places where we thought there was some potential risk. So, in fact our operations people have been encouraged by me to at least consider the idea of buffering ourselves against a handful of long lead time items were there is a relatively sole source provider.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer:  And is the risk there on the component level or contract manufacturer.
Steve Berglund:
 : I wouldn’t dare to speak about the contract manufacturers. So, I would say more on the component side. But for any high-tech manufacturer they will always have a relatively extensive list of unique suppliers to provide a result source for a component. And so I think and then where the replacement cycle might be three months or six months or something like that. So I think we are going through the exercise looking for alternative sources of supply, but then also looking to buy ourselves little insurance. But I would not see any kind of write-down risk out of that activity at all.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer:  Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Steve Berglund: Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question is from the line of Jeff Evanson with Dougherty & Company.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company:  Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. We know its tough environment for everybody so that’s really not news but I guess what I would like to know Steve, is where do you think you are executing ahead of the competition in this tough environment? Where are you taking share? What incremental tactical things are working? And what are some things that are not moving along as fast as you would like outside of the economy?
Steve Berglund:  Sure. Well let’s start with probably maybe the easiest case to identify within the company which is in the Mobile Solution's segment, because this has been true for really since we bought @Road but I think is becoming more and more evident in this environment which is if you look at the relative competitive side is the Fleet Manager of some size running a fleet of 1000 or 2000 or potentially 10,000 brings in the competition to consider the who would be the best technology solution for that fleet. Okay, again the current picture of that environment is that okay there are five invited in, Trimble will be larger than the others by a factor potentially in terms of revenue size, 10 to 1, 100 to 1 but it orders a magnitude larger.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Just in the GMS business.
Steve Berglund: Pardon me. Yes in the GMS business. Yes, that would be the typical scenario, so there are competition usually runs from $5 million, $10 million maybe up to $40 million a year in revenue. So apparently manager find basically talking about installing a solution on a fleet of 5,000 my job is on the line. I am going to start to wonder who is going to be there in five years to support me and here is the case where both Trimble’s brand and the Trimble brand is worth more than we ever dreamed of in this market, but I look at Trimble company with both a history with the balance sheet with a reputation of supporting it's customers and in that environment from my perspective it's ours to loose. The only way we should loose in an environment like that within limits of course. Yes if we screw it up, but we should be the class act in that marketplace and that’s our expectation and we have got established best standards and we have to live up to it.  When it comes to Ag I think it plays out, I am not sure that there are any step function changes in competitive alignment there. I think the trend that we have seen for the last two-three years will continue but this is the trend that favors us.  So at the low end, again we are the largest company at the low end. We have had a history here of innovating and so I think get the low end, the easy guide level product I think we are doing well. At the higher end largely the competition is John Deere. And the question is what is John Deere's focus at this time. And their competitive focus maybe more selling heavy metals than it is on selling technology at this point in time. There may be some ability for us to kind of be what we are and have our focus on technology, endures focus maybe somewhere else at this point in time. But then I think where we do create advantage on the Ag side, whether it will be the true count or the Ross acquisition were filling out our production line, we are becoming a full capability provider and therefore, we are taking advantage of this period to kind of solidify, ourselves in terms of our market position becoming more than what we were, and becoming something more meaningful to the agricultural segment in general. And then again I think the international grounds of agriculture are still to be exploited and we have balance sheet, and we have institutional reach internationally. Now when it comes the E&C I think its kind of more of the same. So within E&C I think okay the SITECH thing if we execute well on, SITECH over the next 12 to 18 months we achieve something that creates significant competitive advantage. If you look at we haven't talked much about it, we mentioned it but in this whole BIM space, this emerging BIM space, building information model space is we are setting out the role of being kind of the key link between the information systems and what's happening onsite in the field and we believe we can carve out a key role in that space.  Now it's an attractive space is doing actually comparatively well at this point in time. But again we have the ability as a company to continue to invest in that space during this time and create a long lasting platform there. So I think we can, let's call in the more self confident style then the competition can in this time. And then when it comes to kind of the some of the classic areas of E&C let's called survey instruments, I think the second brand strategy is working for us, I think that with the level of aggressiveness we can continue to displace competition at the lower end mechanical total stations and survey instruments we continue what we are doing at the high ends and the trend there is fine. And on the machine control I think that it's both the innovation and the SITECH and then this whole connected construction site, again we are attempting to do something nobody else is doing and I think again we got the relative reach as a company to continue to build this space maybe while others are focusing on their core business. So, again the story changes across the company, but I think, again I would view this as an opportunity set strategically more so than anything else.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company:  I know, you mentioned SITECH first, within E&C, so I will ask about that specifically, other than personal force of will and moral suasion is there anything you can do to bring that process back in line with your expectations given its delays?
Steve Berglund : Yes. I think I'm not talking about significant delays. But I'm saying people were trying to figure out life both, us and everyone else was trying to figure out what's the meaning of life a little bit in the fourth quarter. And so, I think there was a natural. Maybe I mischaracterized it by saying it delay, maybe it was a pause in the fourth quarter. So, I think that we got a fairly extensive group of people doing nothing but focusing on working the SITECH arrangements around the world. So, I think they were in comparatively good shape. We're not announcing each and everyone of them. So, there maybe a little deceptive, because there is not a great deal that's visible but at this point in time, I would not know the exact number at the top of my head. But let's say they are between 20 and 30. If you will deals being processed at one level or another at this point of time. So, its not certainly not at a standstill. But we did take a pause in the fourth quarter.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company:  With respect to TMS, I guess what you are leading me to conclude is you should be taking share there. But I thought we kind of expected there might be a deal coming up here, a major win. Whilst the status of some of your element pipeline?
Steve Berglund : Yeah so obviously we announced one yesterday which is probably indicative. It was a 2100, at least initial 2100 units from our Windstream. So I think it's less a matter of any blockbuster single deal although there are some significant deals out there, other than the fact that we have, let's take, characterize it as dozens of deals currently in the pipeline that are being worked either in field task or being negotiated over one thing or the other. Now, depending on who the other party this may never be press released if the purchaser does not want a press release we're certainly not going to put one out. So again some of this maybe invisible but the one that came out yesterday relative to Windstream is obviously public now. But I think again there have been a couple to be honest that where the worst came back is we've just gone through a cut back. We've cut back our staff. We're deferring consideration of the deal for six months or until 2010 but there have not been many of those. So essentially we still have a significantly more robust pipeline than we have ever had before in this business. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: How much is attrition running ahead of your model in that business?
Steve Berglund : In terms of churn?
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Yes.
Steve Berglund : Okay as we have kind of talked about over time churn out of the @Road business. So first of all relative to the traditional TMS pre-@Road business churn has run pretty close to zero. Now, okay with construction being down, some of the ready neck, we are seeing trucks part in a few cases. So there is some level of churn but effectively the churn has not been a consideration historically in the traditional TMS business. Now @Road brought with it what's called a higher level of churn than we were anticipating the CDPD conversion of roughly three years ago is causing a spike at this point of time. So we are running at a higher churn level than our model we would call for at this point in time. I suppose the implicit question there is how much of that is economy related and how much is not. And at this point of time. The significant majority of it we would regard is being kind of a still a fixed program in terms of restoring a level of, first of all making sure we are selling to the right people that they can get the right value out of the system and there may have been cases in the past where, may be where we are reselling something where the value could not be fully realized. The second is a matter of customer service. So we over last six to nine months have been continually upping the relative level of customer support starting with kind of a one month call and six month call. So to think then also monitoring performance and making sure that we intervene early if we see a user not using the system. So the churn is higher than we would like it's higher than the model. But it has not taken step up in the last four to six months. So it appears that the economy is not having a dramatic effect on churn at this point. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company:  Okay and my last question on field solutions. You have been investing in the area of application control. How far long that process, are you, do you still have more acquisitions to do. Or are you have you pretty much made the acquisitions you need to make there?
Steve Berglund : With unnecessary telegraphing anything particularly significant, I would not say that we are done yet. I think there are number of problems still to be solved in the agriculture around. We believe we have ideas and how to solve them. And I would say is that again along our typical profile of comparatively small beach heads sorts of acquisitions I would in general say we are probably not done.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company:  Okay. Thank you.
Steve Berglund : You bet.
Operator:  Your next question is from the line of Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan Securities.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities:  Hi, great. Thank you, good afternoon. Obviously the macro environment is just creating a big headwinds here. But as you guys look internally what are maybe key lean indicators or things that you are watching that might point to stabilization or turn around in the end markets for E&C?
Steve Berglund :  Again I don't think looking at aggregated data or kind of externally available data necessarily does us whole lot of good. So, I would say that for example machine sales and things like that, are not good indicators of what we are seeing. But I think that the issues that are facing us in E&C are okay the primary one is the financing one which is I think there was an absolute and precipitous drop in confidence. You can pick the day in September and then it got worse in November. So I think when we start to hear, when we start to talk to contractors, when we start to talk to surveyors and they start to express a level of, business is lousy. It's x percent lower than it was last year. But okay I understand what my next six months are going to be I can anticipate what my next 12 months are. When we start to detect this all psychological because I don’t think this is a, I don't think this is a matter of data. I think this is matter of confidence more than anything else. Once we start to detect kind of the willingness of our business is to kind of engage constructively with us at that point in time. I think that we start to anticipate an inflection point.  We saw at a lesser extent but we saw exactly the same phenomenon after 9/11. Decision making stopped on the afternoon at 9/11 2001 and really didn't restart for nine months. So we have seen this kind of breakdown in confidence before, and once it starts to come back at that point in time we can walk on to that contractor site and we can start to, we have got something worth selling.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: How much of you mentioned financing, how much of it is, these guys can get financed in a construction loans. And if that starts to open up and you have a few of your guys coming and say hey we are getting loans. That might be helping change the confidence. Would you see that as an indicator or?
Steve Berglund : Yeah I think again you know there a what I would call a micro level where key individual projects can get financing. So therefore they never get built. But I think may be there is a larger issue here. Its just a pure headline factor which is I am scared and therefore I am not making a decision until I find a reason not to be scared any longer. So I think yeah, the relative flow of financing into the construction romp will certainly be helpful. And again this plays out on international basis too this is not just the US phenomenon. But I think some of it is, for a contractor that has work, may be it's of lower level than any level that, that contractor see. If that contractor has work we have got the ability to go sell that contract. But I think its kind of confidence about the future and the fact that for the last four months is nobody has had any real concept to what that feature is.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay, in your Field Solutions you are still having some positive growth there. Can you break down in a little more detail you much of it is Ag and versus GIS and is it really Ag driving that and how’s GIS doing?
Steve Berglund : Yeah so I think by and large I think you can attribute virtually all of the growth to agriculture at the moment but having said that I think GIS maybe a quite performer for us in 2009. We have done some re-organization. We increased relative focus on vertical markets and I think we are getting some traction in GIS at this point in time. How that works out quantitatively I do not know but qualitatively I would tell you that GIS is not one of the businesses I’m worried about for 2009 at this point.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: And lastly about three main segments, a question on TMS I think you mentioned in the past quarter some new initiatives and some poor performance in the software and drug store deliveries some reinvestment there? Can you talk about these other solutions in TMS and whether you are in full with them you kind of reducing investments and how that can help your margin structure?
Steve Berglund : Yeah again I think that a lot of this before we kind of whack out or take a whack at businesses that are not performing at this point in time and certainly there is a field service ROM is not producing international results at this point in time. I think again we need to come to a view in terms of just what the environment is going to be like in the next six months and the next five months. So that we can be again somewhat balanced and proportional in our response. But I think the way we have described it. I may not give the numbers precisely what I recorded in the past, but this is can be largely the true. Is that in the TMS in the Mobile Solution segment roughly 80 plus percent of the revenue base is producing operating margins in the vicinity of 20%. So in other words vast significant majority of that segment is healthy, let's call it in the neighborhood of 20%. Operating margins was for the moment was defined us the healthy indicator and what we got our things like field services and some other geographic plays that are pulling down that performance. So, obviously we could make in instant decision to improve financial results by making up a portfolio decision. But at that point of time we are kind of turning our back on market that has got 20 million to 30 million unit potential out there and where we believe we are actually have a superior product. So, again we are not going to make decisions like that casually and not necessarily just for short term considerations. I think this is again achieving right balance between short term and long term. But, so at any point of time we are making a number of, we got a number of businesses in anticipation that is what we do as a company and we can obviously improve financials instantly by making a series of portfolio decisions, but again we are not going to make those decisions likely.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities:   Okay. Great. Thank you.
Steve Berglund : You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Rath with Canaccord Adams. 
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams:  Hi, guys. Just a couple follow on questions if I could. Of the eight acquisitions you announced here, two of them were in the Field Solutions business, are you able to tell us how much they might have contributed in revenues in the fourth quarter?
Raj Bahri: I will take a crack out but typically like the once we in field solutions that we talked about we will be integrating it with our best products and selling at fall back. So with acquisition and what not gets pretty difficult to track. But I'll give you round number, we probably added, these are question lot of when they done in November and December time period, probably one to two points.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Is that, $1 million to $2 million or, 1% to 2% in year-over-year?
Raj Bahri: Growth year-over-year.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Okay, plus, okay perfect, the second question I have is, and I understand visibility in macro you explained, your position well enough, I just from an external standpoint, there is lots of moving parts obviously, do you expect the E&C business for instance to be in the first quarter flat up or down, I know its not much but, it might help us. Any color there, I am talking compared to the fourth quarter from a revenue standpoint.
Steve Berglund : Yeah, again just as matter of analytical precision we can never talk about sequential effects. We always compared to the prior year same period just because those kinds of so seasonal. So compared to the prior year at the moment we would expect E&C to be down. Again we are kind of saying as that we expect the conditions in the fourth quarter to continue into the first quarter and therefore, is what the number Raj came out with here assume E&C will be down compared to the same quarter prior year. Now having said that I mean looking forward is we are in search of the right template to use is, well we've got three templates of comparatively recent history available to us there is first half of 2008 which was difficult. But in a case where we showed fair progression. The third quarter which began to fall apart in the middle of September, so it's definitely difficult, but a quarter which we could work with and then there was this strange event in the fourth quarter which was kind of unprecedented than anything we have ever seen. And so, that looking forward its not clear by the time we get into the second quarter, what the template is that we're going be looking at that point. But what we're basically saying that first quarter is going to look a lot like the fourth quarter.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams:  Okay. All right. And then maybe, differently phrasing the question for the field solutions, I understand it's a book-and-build business, and it seems like you are seeing obviously some of different but similar macros creep in to that end market if you want to say for now.
Steve Berglund :  Well, actually that’s not what we said. Okay, there is reason to be let's call it careful but we're not saying at this point in time is what we're seeing in construction has yet appeared in agriculture. Financing seems to be okay and Ag is more kind of a psychology of the market that will determine things than anything else at this point of time. So, we are seeing is a different environment in Ag than we are seeing in construction.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams:  So, you're pretty confident that still is a growth business year-over-year for you at this point without characterizing too much?
Steve Berglund :  Yes, at this point in time, I would not declare myself to be pretty confident on anything. I'm just telling you like we see it today, but as you say there are a whole lot of moving parts out there and as a CEO, I'm not going to be pretty confident on anything, I'm just telling you what we are seeing today and if the headlines turn ugly tomorrow, this situation can turn on us.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Perfect. And just a last couple of accounting questions, Raj. You said based on your guidance 14 I just want to clarify; $14.2 million in amortization expenses for Q1 is that?
Rajat Bahri:  Yeah. What I said was $14.2 million of amortization expenses, $4.2 million of stock-based compensation expense and $5.5 million of restructuring charges.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of the Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Yeah, good afternoon. A couple of quick questions. The first one is about the tax rate. I think you talked about certain factors some one-time and than more, the others to do with your global supply chain, so getting there some indication as over the next couple of years, how that tax rate is likely to change. And than the second question is just looking at the federal governments's economic stimulus package, and just looking at the size of the package whether that's sufficient based on your judgment to actually use that for slack in the capacity utilization and your customers for your E&C segment and actually drive some demand, or do you think that is insufficient right now to actually do that. And if you do expect it to have a positive impact, what the potential timing of that could be just given where you play in the cycle?
Rajat Bahri: Well, let me do with the tax question and then I will hand it over to Steve for the stimulus question. On the tax question, we had a full year tax rate of 26%. In 2007, the tax rate was around 36%. So the improvement was driven by the fact that we put a global supply chain project in place, and we have international profits are now taxed at pretty much at a very low tax rate. So structurally, we have a very good structure in place. What can impact us going into the future is just a mix of where their profits are. And this year is 26, it could be, 26 had built a little conservatism into next year number and call it at 28 for next year. But if the mix remains the same this year, we could have slight benefit.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: And by this year, next year you mean 2008 and 2009 or 2009 and 2010.
Rajat Bahri: Next year if the forecast is 28 at this point.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. 
Rajat Bahri: And 2008 is close to 26%.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it
Rajat Bahri: Okay. So as far as the stimulus package, I think we are sitting back and waiting. If we talking about the US stimulus package, and I assume we are, I think we are sitting back and waiting for some natural detail to emerge here, because again there are many moving parts here. So I think there is what is being called the straight infrastructure portion of it, which I think is typically being characterized as roughly a $100 billion at this point of time. But then there are other aspects which are of interest to us. So anything in the electrical grid involves at least second or third order set of possibilities for us, so they are across at whole 800 odd billion dollars stimulus package. There are a number of points of interest to us. But I think the $100 billion, if we characterize the $100 billion infrastructure spend, as being the level we are talking about here, I think there are a number of questions that remain to be answered, so there's a early portion of that will be largely directed towards me, and since I understand it which is to get people employed sooner than letter. So I think that's considered to be the zero to six month sort of stimulus there. And then the project portion of it probably, I think people are hopeful for the second half of the year to start some of that flow, but I would question whether there is any real effect in 2009, or whatever effects there are in 2010. And so it think that certainly, we are not at the moment and we may change our attitude on this. At the moment in terms of dollars flowing through, I am not sure that were expecting a great deal of impact on 2009. I could be wrong on that. I think the kind of the second order effects of this stimulus package are maybe as important, which is okay again restoring confidence, getting contractors back engaged. They start to see some dollar flow in front of them, they start to engage, they start to talk about improving their businesses all that sort of thing. And then I think buried in the whole stimulus thing are again a number of second and third order factors that probably turn out to be as important, so for a lot of these contractors are comparatively small businesses and certainly a lot of surveyors are either self practitioners or operate in small firms. And so I think the issues of tax, rule and regulations all the other stuff out there also have a factor here in terms of setting the level of business confidence and the willingness to invest. And I think some of these second order factors may end up being as important is just the pure dollar effect here, so we are waiting to see. Now I think the question in all appropriate conservatives here is, okay $100 billion stimulus is a great thing if it flows into infrastructure, but then I think the effects out of the financial sector in terms of availability financing and how that effects commercial spending is as important. So I think that two have to be looked at in conjunction it's about this government spending or the government sponsor spending that goes on, but then I think there is also issue of, okay, what's happening in the financial markets, what's happening in terms of general economy, because we have to look, both for the government spending and as well as the commercial spending to kind of get the full picture. And I think its way too soon to really have a deterministic view of that.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. Thank you.
Raj Bahri: Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question is from the line of Bennett Notman with Davenport & Company.
Bennett Notman - Davenport & Company:  Actually my questions have been asked and answered, thank you.
Raj Bahri: Thank you.
Operator:  And your next question is from the line of Sunil [Dapshadar] with Sentinel Investment.
Sunil Dapshadar - Sentinel Investment:  Yeah, thanks. You mentioned, you talked about the dealers basically, they face problems with the financing portion. Have you seen any kind of restocking phenomena or change coming back into that area, or you still think that it's too early to comment on?
Raj Bahri:  Maybe I interpreted your questions properly if didn't re-ask it, but just talking about the comparative health of the dealer channel and effects that we are seeing. So first of all, we believe that there was just a meaningful reduction in dealer inventories in the fourth quarter. Now any individual dealer doesn't necessarily hold a whole lot of inventory for a large dealer it might be $1 million to $2 million at Trimble staff. For a medium size dealer, it might be more in the range of a million dollars. So per say each individual dealer doesn't carry a whole lot of inventory. But if you take, let's call 50 to a 100 dealers across the world that are of some significant size, if each of them brought down their inventory by a meaningful percentage. It does add up to a fair number, so we believe we did see a meaningful inventory effect on our revenue in the fourth quarter, but what we would have expected at the end of the fourth quarter given that we were going into the Ag seasonal high quarter and that we were at least in the early stages of moving into the construction, seasonally high quarter. We would have expected inventories to rise in the fourth quarter instead we saw them fall in the deals now it was more than that. Our people reading headlines and being concerned and just conserving cash. Now it's also in effect a good thing, because it does represent the improvement Trimble has made over the last three to five years on delivery performance that dealers can now count on more reliable delivery functionable and therefore can actually reduce their inventory. So I think at some point here, I am not calling for this quarter certainly. But at some point in time, I think we see some natural rebuild of inventories occurring, but I couldn't call the time at this point in time. But whether it was a part of your question or not, but let me.
Sunil Dapshadar - Sentinel Investment:  Yeah, that’s essentially to what I wanted. But now since you have improved your supply to the dealers probably it means that dealers I think forward permanently meet or your level of inventory in that case? Is that the way we should read and you'll answer right now or is it that the restarting may just happen, because dealers are in the near-term carrying extremely low inventories?
Steve Berglund:  Well, again what I am saying is that in terms of looking at the company, I would say is that it would be not be probably, conservatively smart thing to do is to assume that we get a step function either in the first quarter or the second quarter of an inventory rebuild factor. It may happen and may start to happen, but I think that in the greater order of things it's not going to be a meaningful effect for us in the first and second quarter, so I would say is the inventories are down. What we're going to see now is that what I would expect would be the true underlying demand in the marketplace, because I don't think we saw the true underlying demand totally in the fourth quarter as result of the inventory effect. But I think we will see that from now on. And along the way, there may be over the next two to four quarters there maybe, let's call a gradual rebuild of inventory in the dealers, but I think it going to be very hard to detect.
Sunil Dapshadar - Sentinel Investment:  Okay. On China, you mentioned that. Okay, China's infrastructure stimulus package is going to be spent, it's being spent now currently, and how much is China as a percentage of your revenues?
Steve Berglund:  We don't break it out as a separate entity. Let's just say it's getting to be a.
Raj Bahri:  It's top five market for us.
Steve Berglund:  Well, okay. Let's characterize it that way. In terms of the national market it's now firmly in the top five national market for us as a company.
Sunil Dapshadar - Sentinel Investment:  Okay. And if you had a very high margin degradation in the E&C segment, if the market improves okay, maybe three quarters down the road. Do you think that your margins can get back to the levels where they 18% to 20% of revenues, or in that E&C segment, or you think that those margins compressions, there might be some kind of a margin compression overall going into probably 2010 period, or is that the way one should look at or?
Steve Berglund:  No. Actually I don't think that's way to look at it. So, okay call this aspiration on my part in the call aspiration on the part of the management group. Again, we have to produce numbers to say that we are worthy of that aspiration. But I don't think we are conceding. Okay, so we view let's call E&C segment. And before I start, let me kind of breakout as side category that we will talk about, we will have a tendency to talk about separately as an item, because it will be an investment and we will talk about discreetly, which is this virtual side activity the new joint-venture with Caterpillar and the associated activity around Trimble. So on that one, I am saying okay that me affect results, but it's not part of the base line at this point in time. But if we are talking about the baseline E&C business, we are not conceding in the short-term, we are not conceding those margins even in the short-term. Again, we started taking actions in April, but been cumulative set of actions since last April. They were stepped up in January, but the actions being taken are really intended to let's call restore a margin in the vicinity of 20% that has just taken the ground internal for this company. We'll see how we do against it. Obviously depends to certain extent on the external environment, but we are not backing away from kind of those near 20% operating margins as our stake in the ground even in the short-term. Now the effect that we could see that I talk to in the script, is that if it does turn, if we see the inflection point, is what we are likely to see as we did back in 2002 is what we are likely to see even if we restore to those near 20% operating margins, what we are likely to see is a early on in the recovery is a significant acceleration of improvement on those margins. So I don’t think the right attitude for us, and again you could sit back and watch us and we will see if we deliver, but I don't think the right view on us is that there has been even let's call the medium-term impairment on those margins as that we expect to recover those margins at this point.
Sunil Dapshadar - Sentinel Investment:  Okay, if I may ask a last question on the market share, probably. You had talked about the competition is particularly from John Deere and not on the low end. Did you see that in the fourth quarter that you may probably, or I don't know may have lost any kind of market share, or you think that you have pretty much held your market share and you expect that thing to continue and probably might be more competitive in the future?
Steve Berglund:  Yes. So, certainly I've learned to spell the word humble in the last three to four months more so than I would have historically. So it's hard given the market confusion, I'm not going to be overly categorical here. But I would say it's certainly my belief, and I've got in most cases date of the supported is across the board. I don't believe the loss in the market share, and I can believe that pretty much in most of our market, I can make the case that we gained in market share in the fourth quarter.
Sunil Dapshadar - Sentinel Investment:  Great. Thanks Steve, thanks.
Steve Berglund:  Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Berglund for any closing remarks.
Steve Berglund:  No closing remarks. I look forward to talking to you in three months, hopefully in a clearer environment. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you all for participating in today's Trimble fourth quarter and fiscal 2008 conference call and webcast. You may now disconnect.

We look forward to seeing you there, Steve?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon. Today we will add some additional third quarter details, the comments we made on October 6 and establish the context for Trimble within the unprecedented... uncertainty that surrounds us all. In summary, our fourth quarter forecast is significantly less precision than normal because we remain predominantly a book and bill business that is in the short-term subject to the ways of fear, uncertainty and doubt that are enclosing short-term buying behavior by businesses. We anticipate 2009 to be a difficult year, but believe we have businesses within our portfolio that can grow. Finally, our confidence in our three year strategic path remains undiminished. As we indicated in our earlier call, we came up short on our expected third quarter revenue, largely due to the chilling effect of the freeze up in the credit markets on our customers. Much of the impact is decidedly short-term with some of the effects having obvious implications for 2009. We can point to dozens of anecdotes where the credit crises has resulted in loss sales for Trimble late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. In some cases banks and other financing entities have denying credit to our customers. However in the significant majority of cases, our customers simply been afraid of the effects of the credit crises and have shutdown spending until some clarity emerges. Until confidence rebounds and some kind of steady state is established, it will be difficult for us to regain precision in our short term forecast. We believe we are well positioned to confront a traditional U.S. recession, one that does not involve the fear of systemic financial collapse, and our anticipating being in that environment during most of 2009. We have gotten to this week; emerging from the third quarter is on earnings; in spite of the revenue shortfall we exceeded our earnings guidance and achieved an improvement in the quality of our earnings model. Our gross margin was up year-to-year demonstrating a favorable product mix, improved costs and the absence of major pricing pressure. Our sales, marketing, and administrative expenses were also down year-to-year as a percentage of revenue demonstrating our seriousness of purpose on maintaining the quality of our model under a revised revenue scenario. As a result we saw non-GAAP operating margins expand over the prior year. In the third quarter we continue to see strong performance in our agriculture business and continued robust international growth outside the U.S. and Europe. We also saw a further reduction in the tax rate. We remained challenged in the E&C segment and we're comparatively flat in mobile solution segment as expected. The agriculture story remain centered on comparatively strong pharma cash flows and need to mitigate high input cost for fuel and fertilizer and strong product innovation. While commodity prices have dropped in the short-term, we do not believe this is a major factor for us because our justification is centered on cost reduction and yield improvement which remain as relevant as ever. Agriculture continues to develop as an international story with rapid market development beyond our historical core geographies of North America, Brazil and Australia. We believe we can sustain double-digit growth performance in this business through 2009. This view is based on anticipated demand for existing products, international expansion and a product line expansion into new emerging agricultural applications. The other business in the field solution segment mapping and geographic information systems had a respectable growth quarter with strong margins but do not see the traditional strong end of year... end of fiscal year push from U.S. government, presumably because of tougher spending controls in Washington. As expected the mobile solution segments quarterly results were unimpressive for the quarter with relatively flat revenue and earnings compared to the prior year. While we also expect fourth quarter to be relatively flat compared with the prior year, we are increasingly pleased with the prospects for 2009 in this segment and believe it has potential for taking end process steps in the next 15 months in subscriber growth and resulting financial performance both in the U.S. and internationally. Although the owners of small fleets of vehicles are in a comparatively hunted down state as they confronted slowing economy, we're seeing unprecedented levels of activity and interest among large fleet operators who have the potential for eliminating significant cost by adopting our technology. We are aided in our pursuit of these enterprise accounts by the Trimble brand and reputation which puts us in a good position to represent ourselves as a strong and reliable life time partner as compared to a universe that is still often populated by much smaller competitors with much shorter history. The army improving prospects for significant enterprise level orders, we are also seeing an expanding sales pipeline internationally against the baseline of close to zero a year ago. This activity is taking place in Europe, Latin America and parts of Asia. Against the positives within the Mobile Solution segment, we continue to wrestle with some businesses within the segment. The handheld field service and direct store delivery business has a growing sales pipeline but continues to be a financial drag. Our expectations for this business are tied to our new platform product the Mobile Application Platform aimed at a market of tens of million of workers which explains our relative patients. Our transportation and distribution business and our efforts in Asia-Pacific are also a drag on performance. We are achieving increased traction in the Asia-Pacific Mobile Solution market and believe we can achieve stronger performance levels during 2009. The construction supply, pre productivity, Telco and public businesses... public safety businesses are all reflecting healthy trends. Third quarter engineering and construction segment revenues reflected continuing high levels of uncertainty in U.S. and Europe while our international business outside those regions continues to be generally strong. The slower economy in U.S. and Europe is translating into fewer construction starts and fewer capital purchases. This is an environment we believe we can sell into since productivity and cost reduction become more relevant to contractors during tougher times, a factor that is not allowing us to engage in an effective sales process, and E&C is the paralysis of decision making that is resulting from the freeze up of credit markets and resulting reactions by business managers. In a number of cases we have seen investment decisions that were already made get put on hold as a result of a blanket spending freeze. The negative picture's not consistent across the segment. Our laser tool's business which was our largest exposure to housing fell sharply from the prior year. Other categories such as survey instruments which began to slow in early 2007 after an exceptionally strong 2006 was up single digits... up strong single digits year-over-year in the Americas. Under more traditional circumstances we might be asking ourselves that we had touch bottom and we are seeing early stages of recovery. In the current macroeconomic environment it is impossible to put these market moves in context and create credible judgments. Overall we are looking at 2009 with a combination of concern about the macroeconomic environment together with a view that we have a number of upside scenarios within the company. The key question will be by how much the upside will exceed the down side. The upside beyond the positive picture I've already outlined for agriculture and mobile solutions will result from a number of other elements. We are seeing robust growth potential outside of the U.S. and Western Europe. Since most of our sales in these areas are for government funded infrastructure development, we are not directly exposed to slowdowns in commercial spending. We expect international to remain strong for us in 2009. Many of our recent corporate efforts have been focused on extending our international presence to realize the opportunity. We also believe we can produce points of growth based on new revenue streams from new adjacent business concepts. For example, we discussed the introduction of our new Forestry product line in the July conference call. While we have yet to make our first sale, we've generated a meaningful sales pipeline in the three month since product release. The purchasing cycle is comparatively long but we expect decisions in most cases in the next six months. While acknowledging the possibility of macro economic follow-up, the sales pipeline alone has the potential to create 1 to 2 points of growth for Trimble next year from an entirely new source. Another new adjacent area for Trimble is our Geospatial initiative. Here we are creating new tools to provide our existing customers Geospatial information with which to more efficiently plan, build, monitor, and operate their infrastructure. We are initially focused on three vertical markets: roads and highways, transmission and distribution for electrical and water utilities and oil and gas transmission and distribution. We will develop imaging and lighter systems in software to collect data and process within the high fidelity 3D models of vital infrastructure. These high fidelity models are used for applications such as road alignments studies, environmental impact assessments, infrastructure design and cost estimation, vegetation management, road condition assessment and roadside asset management. To accelerate our position in this emerging marketplace, we have made four small acquisitions in the last year. Rollei Metric is a developer of high resolution, ruggedized metric cameras using aerial and terrestrial systems to collect imagery. TopoSys is a developer the aerial of data collection systems comprised of high resolution cameras and LiDAR. GEO-3D is a developer of mobile vans that collect similar imagery and LiDAR data from roadways. INPHO is a developer of office software to process the LiDAR data and imagery using photogrammetry techniques to generate the 3D models. This portfolio enables Trimble to offer an end to end solution to our customers. By leveraging Trimble's worldwide capabilities, we believe we can generate meaningful short term growth in this new business during 2009. These are two examples of new ideas becoming new sources of revenue. Beyond these two applications, we are actively pursuing a number of other adjacencies within the company with the potential to establish ourselves in new market segments during 2009, with implications for 2009 and beyond. The new joint venture and distribution agreements with Caterpillar announced on October 6th have major implications strategically, but also have short-term potential as well. The announcement has been well received and participants in the distribution channel who have been awaiting the announcement are now moving forward with implementation plans for the new SITECH concept. Market conditions aside, we expect a much more energetic channel from construction machine control and the emerging connect-to-site products in 2009. As we said in the earlier call we expect the effects from these agreements to add two points to Trimble's annual growth rate going forward. While all our actions are undertaken with a three-year view, we expect these and other actions will make 2009 something other than a one way street of doom and gloom and certainly make us something more one trick pony tied to the construction industry. We are not backing away from the concept of generating meaningful revenue and earnings growth in the year. Without a doubt 2009 will be difficult and at the moment too difficult to forecast. With the apparent continuing easing of the credit markets, we hope to see a more conventional recession in the U.S., a slow growth environment in Europe and continued growth elsewhere. Our points of focus will be to take the actions necessary to preserve our financial model, to take the aggressive steps necessary to emerge from this period competitively and strategically stronger than we entered it, and to take this as a unique opportunity to improve across the company. Just as the actions we took in recession years, the 2001 and 2002 created the platform that launched us on a six-year trajectory of growth. We anticipate using this period of adversity as an opportunity to establish a stronger position for ourselves. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Good afternoon. In the third quarter of 2008 revenue was $328.1 million, up approximately 11% from revenue of $296 million in the third quarter of 2007. Operating income for the third quarter of 2008 was $54.1 million, up approximately 24% from the third quarter of 2007. Operating margins in the third quarter of 2008 were 16.5%, up from margins of 14.8% in the third quarter of 2007. Excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense and amortization of inventory step-up, non-GAAP operating income was $69.9 million was up 21% compared to the third quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating margins were 21.3% in the third quarter of 2008, up from 19.5% in the third quarter of 2007. We contributed 38% of the increase in revenue to the operating income line this quarter. Net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $39.1 million, up 43% compared to the net income of $27.4 million in the third quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008 were $0.31, up 41% from diluted earnings per share or $0.22 in the third quarter of 2007. The tax rate for the third quarter of 2008 was 30% compared to 39% in the third quarter of 2007. The lower tax rate is due to the previously announced implementation of a global supply chain structure. Adjusting for the items noted above, non-GAAP net income of $50.2 million for the third quarter of 2008 was up 40% compared to non-GAAP net income of $35.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008 were $0.40 up 38% from non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29 in the third quarter of 2007. By geography in the third quarter 55% of revenue was in North America, 24% in Europe, 14% in Asia Pacific and 7% in the rest of the world. Versus prior year this represents growth rates of 9% in North America, 5% in Europe, 21% in Asia Pacific and 29% in the rest of the world. I will now cover results by segment on our underlying non-GAAP basis. Engineering and construction revenue was $191.9 million, up approximately 5%, when compared to revenue of $182.1 million in the third quarter of 2007. In general, international sales were solid particularly in Middle East and Asia. But E&C was impacted by continuing slow conditions in the U.S. and Europe. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $42.7 million or 22.3% of revenue, compared to $43.7 million or 24% of revenue in the third quarter of 2007. The margin decline in this quarter was lower than what we experience in the first half of 2008 as the restructuring efforts we implemented earlier on gained traction. Field solutions revenue was $64.4 million, up approximately 44% compared to revenue of $44.8 million in the third quarter of 2007. Revenue growth again was driven primarily by strong demand for agricultural products. Non-GAAP operating income in TFS was $22.3 million or 34.6% of revenue compared to $12.1 million or 27% of revenue in the third quarter of 2007. Operating margin expansion came from operating leverage resulting from increased revenue as well as some improvements in product cost. Mobile Solutions revenue was $40.8 million up approximately 4% when compared to revenue of $39.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in TMS was $4.6 million or 11.2% of revenue compared to $4.3 million or 10.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2007. As we discussed last quarter, we expect operating margin expansion in TMS as we roll out the new direct store delivery product which should begin to favorably impact TMS margins in the first half of 2009. Additionally we are anticipating some new customer amends in the first half of 2009. Advanced Devices revenue was $31.1 million, up 4% when compared to revenue of $29.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $7.2 million or 23.1% of revenue, compared to $5.2 million or 17.5% of revenue in the third quarter of 2007. Improvements in operating margins were due to product mix and increased licensing revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2008 cane in at $102.7 million or 31% of revenue compared to 32% of revenue in the third quarter of 2007. The expense reductions that we took at the end of second quarter had a favorable impact on the third quarter operating expenses, hence we contributed 38% of incremental revenue to the bottom-line. Non-operating income for the third quarter of 2008 was $1.6 million versus $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2007 due to lower interest expense and higher profit from the CTCT joint venture. We finished the third quarter of 2008 with $70.5 million in cash compared to $79.8 million in the second quarter of 2008. In the third quarter we generated $41.6 million in cash flow from operations. We used this and $51 million in borrowing primarily to buy back stock and for acquisitions. As part of our stock repurchase program, in the third quarter we purchased 2.452 million share of Trimble stock at an average purchase price of $32.43 for a total of $79.5 million. This is in addition to purchase of approximately 968,000 shares at an average price of $26.71 in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately 287,000 shares at an average price of $36.25 in the second quarter of 2008. In the third quarter, net accounts receivable were $257.5 million down from $267.2 million in the second quarter of 2008. Day sales outstanding was 71 days down 4 days from 75 days in the third quarter of last year. Inventory was $162 million compared to $153.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. Turns were four times. Now for the fourth quarter guidance. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we forecast revenue between $315 million and $323 million. We expect fourth quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.25 and non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.32 and $0.35. Non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of 2008 excludes the amortization of intangibles of $11.5 million related to previous acquisitions and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $3.8 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance use a 23% tax rate and assume 125 million shares outstanding. The tax rate is expected to be lower due to the supply chain streamlining project we discussed in previous quarters along with the extension of the R&D tax credits by the U.S. congress. Thank you, we will now take questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question. In terms of the slowdown and the weakness you are seeing among your customers and their credit problems, is it... it seems like the weakness is much more in the fuel solution side, do you expect to see something similar in the E&C side? And then a follow up to that is, how much in these businesses start and stop. If distributor stop's buying today, can he restart in a quarter or two or does it... usually take longer to get the business up and running again?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, so first of all... virtually all of this credit related stuff, we are seeing is on the E&C side field solutions which is agriculture and GIS is... so far we haven't detected anything like that in the agriculture businesses, it's all been on the E&C side and GIS is really in a different realm. So, the credit related or let's call it the psychological effect of the credit problems and it's virtually all on E&C side. As far as the stopping and starting aspects of it, it tends to be... the normal business tends to be a... call hundreds or thousands of individual small transactions. So it really is post forming [ph] and it's really a deferral. It's very unlikely that we ever loose a sale completely because the justification once done is as relevant two months later as it was two months before. So it's in the after market. So in reality I don't think our sale is actually lost. It may be postponed for a period of time based on seasonal factors, a contractor in season say from April to through September is many less likely to take a machine out of production to installing machine control system for example. But aside from that we would look at the sort of activities being more of a deferral than an actual loss and could be picked up at any point in time.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: And what about your customer's business. I understand that you wouldn't necessarily lose the sale. But if a construction project is postponed today because of credit problems, doesn't it take... is there a longer than expected lead time to get it up and running again?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, certainly if construction projects are differed or cancelled that eliminates kind of the need for the applications. So yes there is a larger issue here in terms of the ongoing financing of construction projects. So yes in that case... but the first psychological effect is one thing, I think the underlying market dynamics are another.
Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strauss with JP Morgan.
Mark Strauss - JP Morgan: On behave of Paul Coster. A couple of things first, R&D declined a little bit more than we seasonally see in 3Q. Should we expect the same kind of normal bounce back that we get in 4Q or are we going to keep it kind of depressed until we through this?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Now if you look at R&D it was around 11% of revenue last year still at 11% of revenue and so the leverage we are getting versus last year is prime and we look at things versus last year primarily is the leverage is coming from sales and marketing and G&A expense but if you look at R&D as a percentage of revenue, it's pretty close to 11% last year as well as this year.
Mark Strauss - JP Morgan: Okay, Got it. Thanks and then you mentioned the tax rate for 4Q, what should we be thinking about longer-term?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: I mean this fourth quarter is a sustainable reduction because the Congress extended the R&D credits till end of next year and they always have been extending it for the last few years. We just not forecasted it in our projections because the law was just extended end of September. So yes, that should be a sustainable reduction into next year and we should see a point of benefit on the total tax rate for next year because of this.
Mark Strauss - JP Morgan: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: Thank you. Just if I could get a clarification on the tax rate, what is the average tax rate you expect for '09?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Well, this year we expect our total year tax rate with the 23% coming down to full year tax rate to be somewhere in the 29% to 30% range for '08. And I don't see it would a reason to be different next year, unless the mix of our sales by geography changes significantly. That will be the only caveat, but I would expect next year's rate to be in the 29% to 30% range as well for the full year.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: Okay, that's helpful. And with respect to the Ag market.... you say you haven't seen anything yet, but obviously crop prices have dropped pretty precipitously some key ones sort of cut in half, I mean what have you seen or I guess maybe what is your estimation of how significantly the dramatic jump in crop price has boosted your business, because presumably that's the part that you might be at risk, I mean obviously there is always the ROI aspect of the component of what you sell, but there were some upside I think driven by crop prices doubling and now with that cut in half, I would presume there is some downside here. Just wondering what your thoughts are on that?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: That's right, so I think the way to maybe characterize it is through most of 2009 we have seen extraordinary double-digit growth rates in agriculture. I think for 2009 we're looking for strong double-digit growth rates but we're certainly as we have been saying I think all along is we... the rates that we've been saying in early part of 2009 were simply not sustainable in the long-term, because of the froths from commodity prices being so high and the fact there was incredible amount of money flowing through farmers. But again because of the ROI and because yields for example have been high and cash flow is still comparatively high but in primarily because farmers are under margin squeeze and more so or now than they were six months ago and that actually helps us, we think make the pitch. So we're anticipating in 2009 what's called strong a double-digit growth as oppose to an extraordinary double-digit growth rate.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: Great. And then for the fourth quarter I know you made a small acquisition recently, is there much in the way of acquisition revenue contribution in the fourth quarter relative to the third?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Acquisition strategy is consistent, we will be... we did couple of acquisitions in Q3, couple in Q2 and we have a pipeline here and we will keep on executing one to two acquisitions per quarter. So it's a pretty standard strategy we have and it will be consistent with the past.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: Great.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: But again are characterizing the acquisitions we're making there they are all relatively small typically $5 million, $10 million a year would be a fairly typical revenue strength from the acquisitions we are making. We are making them to establish positions in the marketplace or in a technology. So it certainly sequentially quarter-to-quarter there is they blend very much in to the background and not a discernible factor.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: Great. And finally on the gross margin you did have a very nice apparently mix this quarter, can give us any sense of the sustainability of margins at that level are if you expecting the sort of revert back to sort of more historical levels?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me speak generally and Raj maybe can do a better job in answering the question. But gross margins at the corporate level really don't necessarily have a great meaning because we run the individual businesses, top line and operating line and there will be different gross margins depending on the businesses around the company. So, I would say in general it doesn't per say have intrinsic meaning with a stronger dollar that will generally help the ratio of that entrepreneur percentage standpoint. But I don't think there is anything that would say that it's not sustainable given the relative product mix.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I agree with Steve. The product mix up is.... generally our gross margin have been going up except for first half of this year and if look at our strategies it's all driven by higher subscription revenues next year in Mobile Solutions more software sales in the connected site, so in general all the things that strategically we're doing would lead us to believe that gross margins have upward bias to them going forward.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Good afternoon.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Thanks for question. Can you talk about the benefit of foreign currency and the impact of foreign currency in the third quarter and what you would assume for the fourth quarter? And I know that you told about next year a little bit, if these things were probably particular interest?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Versus prior year, dollar was still weak. So that hurt our revenue a little bit, not much a little bit there and it was pretty much neutral on that bottom-line. Now versus when we gave the guidance earlier on in the quarter, the dollar did strengthen since then. And that hurt our bottom-line versus the guidance. And we quantified that as $4.5 million hit on the revenue line that was when we gave the Q3 guidance three months ago, after dollar de-strengthened and we did get impacted on the top-line, but bottom-line actually it was slight benefit for us when the dollar strengthened.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay.What about in the guidance for the fourth quarter, I guess that's?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: We are assuming where the dollar is right now. It looks great. So if it strengthens, it will be slight hit to our revenue and a slight benefit to our bottom-line.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: So it is helping you a little bit. Another thing I want to on the technical side you showed where was the buyback stock each quarter and now that we're having a true bargain sale for the company. You talked about the stock repurchase plans or the thought process about buying stock in the fourth quarter, given the ridiculous valuation of things to be put on stock at this point?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we don't talk specifically for each quarter. What we announced in the beginning was we announced that $250 million planned and we have executed $160 million of that $250 million. Every quarter we look at our acquisition needs, we look at our cash flow situation and we're also going to be understanding where this credit market is, that's the new phenomena and we will balance all those factors and decide what we want to do for Q4.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: I guess, I had one here and I'll try to get back and navigate the area, the question is, is your focus in this quarter really on maintaining liquidity or would you step up your share repurchase over the next couple of months given the kind of price levels of the stock?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes Eli,it all depends on, what we believe the credit market is going in the credit market, is it going to be unfreezing that will lead us to be aggressive in our borrowing theme. But as the credit market continues to be destabilized then we will not, so it all depends on the mix and we'll do what happens.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. Well if we go back to your Ag business just a little bit. Our distributors have to plan in advance to sell the product are their preorders or what is order cycle from your distribution system for products the next year. And what are they doing, because it started off to show product that it's going to up the show, they are going to have it there. Do you have any idea what are you seeing from your distribution system as far as preparing for next years Ag market?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say in this case fortunately, it being October is we don't... we and our dealers really don't need to really confront issues of the inventory levels until probably into December and into January is that. We obviously are planning for over three to six months in terms of our inventory levels. But our dealers actually don't have to make commitments in terms of purchases really until December, to be ready for the Ag season and then December and into January to be ready for construction season. So, right now October and November were going to be in a seasonal low period for the year; but the obvious exceptions of Australia and New Zealand and Brazil and places off of the equator, but by and large let's say it does not become an issue until December. They placed the orders with us. We've respond that typically within 20 to 48 hours in supplying those orders. So it's a very short cycle.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: And did they.... when this deal that placed the order that did do doing it on an anticipated demand or do they have really based on commitments from customers or what they are trying to do? Do you have any sense of how they go about the process?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I think it's more in terms of anticipating the market than hard commitments. Our typical dealer whether it be agriculture or whether it be construction or whether it be the serving instruments, we'll be out in the marketplace everyday talking to a wide variety of customers; demoing product and the like. So we'll have a pretty good sense as to, who's going to make a buying decision and when, but they will buy inventory and at it's a station. They are not actually buying inventory to fill specific orders typically, so there will be a little bit... so we expect our dealers to maintain a reasonable inventory levels so that they can effectively be off the shelf, for most product categories when the customer makes that buying decision, but the dealers will buy in anticipation a moderate level of inventory.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Yes. And final question and you've been able to demonstrate tremendous control of profitability despite variation of demand as in kind of uncertainty. I mean how far would demand have to pull before we will see or is there a number that demand will have to pull before we see a real impact on margins or can you really scale it almost linearly up and down with demand?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I don't know that we can now make that commitment to scale up and down with the demand. I think I had won it for some boundary conditions on that particular statement. But I... you followed us for long time Eli, you understand that we are very serious about, we don't control profits, we control cost by the way. But we are on a daily basis asking ourselves the question about what we're seeing in terms of future demand we're making priority calls, we are controlling cost we have done that for many years and so as result we've been comparatively predictable. We would bring that same ethic into in this environment of uncertainty, so it doesn't come automatically, we don't have magic the formula here but we do tend... we don't have to make, what we don't have to make is six month or 12 month kind of commitments related to capacity all those sorts of things. Our environment is such as that we can scale up or scale down relatively quickly and that's what we've been doing really since April in this environment and we would anticipate continuing to do it but all within some level of constraint to it.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Thank you very much.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co.: Good afternoon and I just want to say congrats on these results I mean there is very impressive given the difficulty of the market and I think you had a lot of pressures in storing the cut... your cost early; few companies have been able to do that as well I think. The question kind of about some of your end markets, I think one of the bigger uncertainties out there is how state and municipal funding is going to be for construction and roads and even government buildings. How do you go about assessing that risk in the U.S. and I guess for that matter in the rest of the world I mean, I think we all understand the places like China have plans to invest considerable funds over the next few years in their infrastructure what do you think the risks are if they see their economy slowing they also have to take their foot off the paddle maybe more gradually than private companies do but still?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay well. Lets start with places like China or India or our non traditional markets where we have been seeing significant growth. So lets just postulate that if there is a feedback cycle here from U.S. and Europe and okay we see Chinese or Indian growth firm slowdown and if they start to ease. I think the opportunity set for us as a company is still enormous from a standpoint that if you look at them penetration if you look at the number of jobs for infrastructure in China or India or anywhere else. If you look at the... our percentage penetration in to those markets pick a low number but its got one digit associated with it. So even if for example just postulating that those markets fall 30%-40% our available market if you will fall 30%-40% that still leaves us enormous potential to penetrate the market. So, even a smaller market in China or India or places or Russia still gives us enormous opportunity. And we... is focusing maybe for a moment on machine control elements and the other construction elements. The other thing that is we'll be new in the very near future as we have not necessarily have the best most capable and most muscular distribution in those areas. We have been building up a dealer channel with this agreement with Caterpillar and this the development of this new distribution channel SITECH we will more or less in a step function away suddenly have significant distribution... well funded distribution with a set of connections in those markets. So we would expect in places like China, India or whatever as even if those markets fell from current levels. Our ability to penetrate the market and maintain or increase our growth rate in those markets is still available to us in a big way. Now working back to the U.S. without a doubt tax revenue environment is not good at all for states, municipalities and alike. So they... it's a point of concern I have no particularly good insight in terms of what's going to happen, we'll adjust to it as we come to it. Now on the flipside, is when Congress and other start to talk about stimulus packages, at least there is discussion about making infrastructure road and bridge and other forms of infrastructure development part of that which makes a lot of sense given the state of infrastructure in this country. So there it maybe come in a mixed form here, there may be some negatives, there may be some positives but I think it's really too soon to tell. But I think it's a point of concern going into 2009, we've attempted to the factor. We are attempting that factor that in terms of our relative views on 2009 but we're still pretty bullish on in the international front and pretty conservative when it comes to looking at the U.S. with Europe somewhere in between.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, that's actually helpful. And can you give us a sense of how you see your competitors, being impacted by the kind macroeconomic environment and what its doing for you or against you in terms of competitive landscape?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well I may be not talking terribly specifically, but our view looking back to 2001 and 2002, we spent 18 months in a pretty dire environment from nearly the end of very end of 2000 through the first half of 2002 there was an 18 month period there that we view it as a pretty tough recession. When we started to emerge from that in the third quarter of 2002, we were in a significantly better place competitively than in the December of 2000. We would actually expect that same phenomenon to occur this time around is and actually that is the message to the management group and the employee group. Out of times of adversity we set the stage for the next round of growth and that's really what we will intend to do. But back to the R&D question that was asked earlier, we would not intend to take our foot off that particular pedal, we'll still keep pushing on it, we'll find leverage elsewhere in the company but the idea here is to use this as an opportunity to build long-term structural competitive position. So I think we have advantages going into this period competitively, again referring to the Caterpillar agreement is I think we have taken a step function forward in terms of strength and quality of distribution. We have to execute of course over the next year in pulling this off, but if we execute well we will have established a much stronger distribution channel both for yes, Caterpillar branded products but with this Trimble ready program we have that has been where with every other machine manufacturer we have varying degrees of cooperation. We can essentially I think move forward very, very much on the construction side during the period of smallness or adversity or whatever. Agriculture, again its a number of factors that are working here. We have strong position but I think you can expect from us over the next months, indications that we're expanding our frame of reference in agriculture. We are taking... we are investing in this business, we believe in this business, we will expand our relative exposure to agriculture doing more in terms of applying technology to the agriculture problem. You will see us taking steps during the slow period not that agriculture slowed, but taking advantage of this time to push harder into the marketplace. And I think the mobile solutions area we're again, we are seeing at the enterprise level of medium to large size enterprises we are seeing, significantly more interest than we have ever seen before. And again there is a case where competitively if you scan kind of the competitive set in that market segment you will find that both from a financial standpoint and a size standpoint Trimble is large but increasingly from a brand standpoint its kind of like the old IBM you don't get fired for picking IBM. That's kind of the role that we're trying to fill in that marketplace. So pretty much across the board and the company is... yes, we may take some body blows in the next year from the macroeconomic environment but relatively we're looking forward to improving our position.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you, Steve I will get back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Evanson with Dougherty.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company, LLC: Good afternoon everybody can you hear me okay?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we can hear you.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company, LLC: Great. Steve within E&C I have been curious to know how much of your growth this quarter came just from market share gains. Would you give us as kind of a general figure there?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: We have to clarify the category, I cannot calculate that might had to have real time, let me characterize more broadly. So I think that we are gaining share I think we are gaining share... we now are gaining share in some markets where we have specific information. So I believe in serving instruments we are gaining share both high end and low end in U.S., in Europe and rest of the world is a little bit more confused. But we believe we're gaining share there. Again I think that, in the areas of construction machine control, I believe we have gained share, I don't have nearly the same quantitative basis for saying that as I do. But where I am confident is that we've had a distribution channel really for the last nine months that has been awaiting the Caterpillar announcement that hasn't been as energetic or as engaged, as we would have, it is now up and engaged. So looking forward, I would be much more I would have much higher expectations in terms of share gain there. I think agriculture, I believe that we are just in terms of differential growth rates by arithmetically, I believe we are gaining market share in agriculture. And then in mobile solutions, the market hasn't really served to tired out so there is less quantitative data, but looking forward to 2009, I am very hopeful there. So I am dodging your question from a quantitative standpoint, because I don't have a ready answer for you. But, I would say qualitatively, I like what I see across the company.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company, LLC: One of my question implied that I do think you're taking market share so that's good and I would love to get your thoughts later on specifically which you think that add in. Steve I think I heard you say that you have a... there is a lot of moving parts for '09. We are trying to model your company just as you are and it's difficult to do, but I think I heard you gave a pretty specific commitment to growth in revenue. And I assume EPS in '09. I guess what I would like to know is what would you put as a probability that Trimble not grow in '09 from '08 on revenues and EPS?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: On that one I am going to dodge you completely, because I am going to ask you then to define the macroeconomic scenario country-by-country. I think that certainly from prior conference calls, we're acting in a more humble state here, simply because week-by-week every Monday morning is a new adventure in terms of what might have happened over the weekend. And we're just saying, we just believe in the last three to four weeks, as there has been some terrible body blows delivered to the economy, the real economy from financial the crisis and it's a question as to how quickly things recover, whether confidence returns or... and whatever. I'm just saying, I think my fundamental message is given what does seem to be universal doom and groom and nothing but negativism out of there is that we as a company are certainly not going to be passive victims in this environment. We believe we can do things to actually create growth in 2009, but in terms of the probability one thing or the other, I'll wait until LIBOR is down below a certain point before I'll open my mouth on the subject.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company, LLC: Okay. And then last question. I assume you talked to E&C customers quite regularly. I'm curious to know how frequently you're touching base with your end customers and what you're hearing from them, I mean obviously you're telling us that there's concerning fear out there. And therefore, the people are delaying purchases. Can you give us the sense of what you're actually hearing from these customers? And then just going back out of caution are they actually starting to see program cancellations?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: The answer is while... asking kind of asking flight question, yes, today I have already talked to a customer in the UK and one here in the US. So I'm certainly personally have a sense of the market at last anecdotally. But I think the clear thing that we're getting from the market at this point is just everybody is looking in the direction of Wall Street.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company, LLC: And but we already established we don't know what we are doing?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well, I can certainly confirm that Jeff. But so I think that preeminent issue at this point in time is, I think on Monday mornings, maybe Monday mornings three four weeks ago CEOs or principles of construction firms or the like, was something wrong. The CEO equivalent was walking in our Monday morning saying I don't understand this stock buying anything and we saw that effect immediately after 9/11 in 2001 which kind of put things in a state of paralysis for nine months nobody was willing to make a decision. I think we're seeing a similar environment at this point in time where right at the moment until people see some sort of clarity that they're simply not willing to make the decision. So I think it's at the moment its significantly more of I don't want to make a decision until I see something out there, more so than at the moment kind of what I recall the classic session of there isn't any business. Now with that, I am not in any fashion denying that economic activity has slowed down. We expected to continue slow or slower in the U.S. and so we're anticipating that but I think that if we could just find a something of a study state, if the banks were working if the financial system was working and we were simply dealing with slow times again we know who to go see? We know how to make that sale? We just need somebody willing to make a decision based an ROI and right at the moment nobody is willing to entertain the decision in any regard at this point in time until they get a better feeling as to whether there is going to be a collapse of Western civilization as we knew it.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company, LLC: Alright thanks a lot Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good bye.
Operator: Our next question is from the line Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Great, thank you and good afternoon. So couple of questions here when you talk about the international opportunities maybe looking mostly at E&C and Ag, what are the main emerging regions that you see that you have the most opportunity to penetrate that and incrementally benefit your revenue?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sorry Scott I, you kind of faded out there, can re-ask the question?
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: It's alright. So you talked a lot about the new product opportunities in areas you're moving to maybe talk a regionally about opportunity of regions you'll not really well penetrate in there, you think your target over this next year that really help drive some incremental revenue growth?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay well. It's probably the kind of the standard west but its actually a fairly global list. Latin America probably becomes a little bit more targeted in terms of product done. I wouldn't necessarily put Latin America necessarily in same category as others but in some ways, there are still some targeted opportunities in Latin America but starting with the Africa which doesn't usually play into U.S. public company conference calls but Africa to us is a fairly significant opportunity because there is a great deal of infrastructure development being done in Africa. Lot of it Chinese funded, a lot of it funded by international aid agencies but we've got a serious sales pipeline into Africa for our fundamental infrastructure products VRS and the like to establish a surveying infrastructure in Africa, to establish things like property lines and the like and there is actually common wide activity going on; coordinated common wide activity taking place. But from our standpoint, okay the first step is to capture that infrastructure business the VRS business to establish virtual reference stations all over Africa and that enables construction and survey rovers to follow and becomes the source of more sustainable business for Trimble. So for example at the moment we have a South African presence. We have actually have a company in South Africa. In the next few months, we will be opening an office in Nairobi, Kenya to support that part of Africa. So we see Africa as actually maybe in the 2009 context it's not going to add tremendous amounts of a dollar growth to the company but over the next three four years, we would actually see Africa as a growing source of revenue for us. The Middle-East even with the decline in oil prices, still tends to have a great deal of construction, is a hot and what I would call a hot market for us. And I would see that continuing through 2009. A Lots of infrastructure development, lots of project development still growing on in the Middle-East. With oil prices being down there maybe some cut back but again it's still a fairly hot market. China is still China, so it even if it takes offs some points of growth, just huge amounts of infrastructure still on the books to be built. We are gaining significant traction already in terms of channel development and organizational development in China. We are much more confident organization today in China then we would have been three, four years ago. Again the SITECH concept coming out of the Caterpillar agreement puts us into the play on things like construction machine control. Our construction machine control sales in China have done deminimus up to this point in time and so for example next year we could achieve a step function piece of growth on construction machine control. Same goes for agriculture. Now we think there are... parts of China there are potential Ag markets for us. We've not made any serious sales into China or at least noticeable sales into China at this point in time. We now have resources in place in China. So actually... that could actually become... start to become a meaningful market for us starting next year. Russia, kind of a confused place at this point of time but still a rich market. We're seeing significant potential for agricultural. Our agricultural capabilities in both Russia and Eastern Europe as these former collectivize farms... large farms, get new management. So I would tend to just say it's pretty much everywhere outside of Western Europe and the U.S. excluding Latin American and obviously excluding places like Japan. But we see the opportunities for construction machine control, we see possibilities for this emerging concept we got of Building Information Management, BIM. That's a new product area for us that is getting some early traction in some of these countries. So construction machine control, some of the other construction stuff survey and survey infrastructure, agriculture and then the Mobile Solution. So we actually see an opportunity set pretty much around the world with a couple of exclusions.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Well that a pretty extensive list, I will give you break and direct my second question at Raj here. Putting your guidance into the model of 22% tax rate, it looks like a year-over-year decline in operating margin. You need to count Q3 with some good cost management and understand summaries and be conservative. And could that... could you talk about is it gross margin, is it some expenses due to this Cat partner... JV that you are doing. What's going into the margin being more flattish, even down based on your guidance?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: If you assume the high end of the guidance it's not a flat margin. Low end of the guidance is slightly lower than flat. So there's some conservative inbuilt in the low side of the guidance. But our guidance is $0.32 to $0.35. And if you assume $0.35, that assumes a margin gain versus prior year. And on the low end you are right, we built in little bit conservatism just respecting the environment out there.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: And is there anything... is there anything built in with cap ramping effects relationship that's been creating more cost than --
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: No, No that's deminimus.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Good afternoon.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Hi.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: A couple of quick questions. I think the first one is regarding acquisitions. I think you pointed out earlier today that while you are expecting to make acquisitions that are very much in the same kind of size and nature of what you have been making over the past couple of years, but you have made too relatively large acquisitions in the past and just given the current market environment and watching evaluations coming broadly, Is it something that you would consider making another large acquisition. I know there was like 6.5 years between the last two or is that something that's out of question?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's certainly not out of the question and I guess you could quote our own past at me I think if I said it was out of the question, the interesting fact there... the interesting calculation here is that if we are going to stay strategically centered on our businesses, the fact that we are pioneering those businesses in many cases that we are creating applications means almost by definition is there aren't a whole lot of other large players populating those markets. And therefore, there are very few what I would call transforming acquisitions that could be done out there. So I would... as a statistical probability say that it is unlikely that we are going to do anything terribly large. There are opportunities in the mobile solutions segment that are a bit larger than what we've done before. There are companies in that range of $40 million to $50 million here in revenue. But in general, I would not be looking for a big game at this point in time, just because to a large extend it doesn't exist unless we take ourselves out of our points of strategic focus.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. And then when you are looking at the available credit right now that you have as a company could you give us... could you remind us what the total amount is, what the agreed upon rates are and what the length of that agreement is?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So we have a credit line and we have $300 million as you... we announced right now we have $50 million of debt on our balance sheet. So we have as of close of Q3 $250 million available to us, all our banks what we call the acquiring bank. So it's led by people like JP Morgan, Scotia, Wells Fargo. So it's holding... we have... we've been withdrawing money from it and it's holding very solid. The cost of our borrowing at this point is LIBOR plus 65 basis points and this agreement is valid for another four years. So our credit facility is very solid very, very cost effective and is there for us for the long-term.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. And just given the fact that you have this credit facility and also the fact that your stock prices come in quite materially does the attract... is your stock more attractive now for share buyback than it was earlier or is there some different kind of math that you are making when you are looking at the cash flows and use of cash flows to acquisitions in your stock price?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: On a particular one year just came here at silence from the sound of the front-end [ph], I am afraid.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I mean typically we don't say anything before the quarter starts. And you have seen our past behavior. So it all depends on acquisition pipeline and what's happening if you have more than normal acquisitions. And as I said two or three banks who go under in the next two weeks; we may not do anything. But if the credit situation continues to be stable as it stabilized somewhat we may do something so.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. Thank you.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next comes from the line of Corey Toben with William Blair & Company.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Hi, good afternoon.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: A couple of things I wanted to touch upon here. Steve in your prepared remarks you'd mentioned that growth in the Rest of World outside of U.S. and Europe would be relatively stronger in E&C business. It would be very helpful if you could just give us a feeling for what percent of the E&C business today is concentrated in the US and Europe?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: We don't disclose that but I look to Raj. We have said some things about that in the past so I'll let him craft an answer for you Corey.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Kindly ask the next question while I try and get you an answer.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Got it. Okay. Shifting gears for a second. Any feedback you could provide on the response from the Caterpillar dealer network thus far in the SITECH announcement. And also on a quantitative basis, what is the capital that you anticipate is needed for the build out of this network in total, and I know you've said in the past that Trimble's portion of the minimal, but could you clarify exactly what you anticipate in terms of capital spending to that build-out moving forward? Thanks.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, so maybe taking in them in reverse orders as far as capital requirement basically from a Trimble perspective effectively nothing. Okay so the idea is here is again the cap dealer principal not the cap dealership or the cap dealership will sit off to the side what we are building here is an entirely new channel. But the idea is for the cap dealer principle, the owner of the cap dealership to buy into the Trimble dealer. But... so the capital requirements there will be somewhere else but they won't be Trimble's. Now we will have to step up in class in terms of the levels of support in such to that dealer channel but in reality there won't... I wouldn't anticipate for the dealer extension, for the distribution channel development, I would not actually expect any CapEx or at least anything meaningful from Trimble. Now in answer to question what's been the response thus far since the October 6th, announcement, really it's been very enthusiastic, it's been very gratifying in part because of the Trimble dealers as well as the Cat, many of the Cat dealer principles anyway have really been in the know as to what was going on since early this year. So this has been a long anticipated event and people have really been sitting and waiting for it to happen. Maybe to our detriment in terms of the levels of activity so far this year. So the response has been a burst of energy, a burst of enthusiasm and really a desire to get going to better penetrate the market. So the response has been positive.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: And can you just, it was the understanding that Trimble's commitment nor the dealers that had the principles. Can you give us a sense of the order of magnitude, how the total commitment to that has about in dealer network?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I don't know and we've actually kind of quantified in aggregate. We're quantifying it kind of region by region and such, but typically to create a dealership for, and to do what we were talking about, there is an obvious investment in inventory. Let's call that a seven figure number, but not a big seven figure number. There is, okay the need to finance and receivables again probably a low seven figure number. And then there is the need to built out the... a service center which does involve some capital expenditure. But again there'll be, let's call kind of two models here. If there is an existing Trimble dealer, it will be a transaction between that existing Trimble dealer and the Caterpillar, the principle of the Caterpillar dealership. So the business is already there, it's already intact. It may get expanded, but again I think the actual capital requirement.... its an equity transaction first and primarily and then, okay, there maybe an additional injection of capital to increase the capabilities. But again I would call it a low seven figure, number of kind of region by region or area by area. Now, the alternative model will be where Trimble has essentially a white spot on the map, where we really don't have kind of that dealer or dealer or dealer of any substance in place at that point in time it will be more of a Greenfield type solution which is the opportunity for Trimble out of this to fill in the map more quickly. And there, there would let's call it a somewhat larger seven figured number to be invested. But, so in aggregate there is a fair amount of the money involved, but it will be spread over that well pretty much so the capital investment level here will not be a any kind of constraint to the about... when we are talking about, kind of the people we are talking about here.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Okay, thanks.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Doyou want to...
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Certainly that question you asked, typically we don't disclose that, but this we did disclose at one of our previous calls. So, what we said was 20% of total company revenue is exposed to construction market or E&C market in U.S. and that continues to be true even in small range.
Corey Toben - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of David Daleyo [ph] with Canaccord Adams.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys thanks for taking my call. Just in for Jeff. I have a quick precision Ag question. So I understand kind of tempering growth in 2009, but does that kind of deceleration start to happen this quarter in Q4 that being said, aside from these economic meltdown that we are seeing. We have a got tough comp coming up in Q4, so just trying to get the feeling for a year-over-year growth in precision Ag in this quarter.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So I don't think we're comfortable kind of breaking out on one quarter guidance. Any particular element of it, because the next question will be about construction and before long, we've kind of broken out the entire forecast.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Let's just say looking forward that we're anticipating the comps that we generated for this year are effectively and possible to sustain. So you're pointing out year-to-year comps. So I think you can probably come for the right judgment on your own on that one, but again we're still looking to a lot of potential in the agricultural market.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No closing remarks. Thanks for calling. We look forward to talking to you in January.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call and webcast for third quarter earning. You may now disconnect. .

I'd also like to ask that during the question-and-answer period, you limit yourself to two questions, so that we can cover all of the questions. Thank you. Steve?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon. Trimble's third (sic) quarter financials is reflected continued exceptional performance in our agriculture business, and continued robust international growth outside of U.S. and Europe. It was also aided by further reduction in the tax-rate, most of which is structural and permanent. Year-over-year revenue growth of 15% was respectable and consistent with our expectations. Year-over-year non-GAAP operating margins could not expand due to some specific short-term factors. Based on our current expectations and a continuing sober view of the environment, Raj will maintain our baseline revenue outlook for the year, and increase the earnings outlook because of the income tax rate. Let me begin by characterizing the agriculture business. And then step through the other issues that impacted our results. The agriculture story remain centered on strong farmer cash flows, the need to mitigate high input costs for fuel and fertilizer, and strong product innovation. Beyond those factors, agriculture continues to develop as an international story with rapid market development beyond our historical core geographies in North America, Brazil and Australia, with new regions such as Europe growing at strong double or triple-digit growth rates. We believe we can sustain strong performance in this business for the foreseeable future because the underlying market drivers are not likely to subside and since we believe the addressable market remains substantially un-penetrated worldwide. Out side of Field Solution, the foremost relevant questions for us relates to the revenue growth trajectory and engineering and construction, operating margins in engineering and construction, revenue growth in Mobile Solutions and markings in Mobile Solutions. Engineering and Construction segment revenue levels reflect a continuing high levels of uncertainty in the U.S. and higher uncertainty in Europe. Our international business outside those regions continues to be very strong, but is not yet a sufficient size to fully contract the U.S. and European conditions. We continue to believe there are two factors at work. One is the slower economy which translates into fewer constructions of supplier and fewer capital purchases. This is an environment we believe we can sell into. The other factor is the unprecedented level of uncertainty revolving around financial sector. Small to medium sized construction of survey of firms which are not certain of their... of the reliability of their traditional lenders help for strategic direction, are likely to become conservative on new capital purchases until the uncertainty passes. While these uncertainties make precise forecasting difficult, we believe what we can see today that the second quarter may have represented an inflection point and that we will see an increased rate of year-over-year growth in the second half E&C. You see operating margins as a percentage of revenue declined year-to-year. Some of this was a result of net... of a number of external factors such as exchange rates which negatively affected the E&C segment margins. Part of it was product mix. For example; we demonstrate a strong double-digit year-to-year revenue growth in lower price Survey Instruments, and muted activity and high-end Survey Instruments. While our delay in the long-term mix of high-end and low-end Survey Instruments remains unchanged and is driven by technological substitution, the mix in the short-term has shifted. While some of this shift was undoubtedly cannibalization of the high-end by the low-end in a slower economy, we believe the logic factors that were with the rapid growth in developing economies, which entered the market by acquiring basics Survey Instrumentation, and then move up in capability. And a meaningful increase in Trimble market share in lower and Survey Instruments worldwide. While our expectations at lower end and higher end instruments with delivery equipment operating margins, the path for achieving that outcome is different. Because the lower end instruments carried a lower gross margin, we have not yet fully adjusted our short term cost model to correspond to the changing circumstances. In spite of these short term margin issues, the relative strength of the low end reflects a positive strategic shift for Trimble as we gain share in the in trade level Survey Instruments, that in turn becomes the foundation for our future migration to higher technology products. This was an explicit defined objective in 2003, when we established the joint venture with Nikon, and created an alternative brand strategy. We did take aggressive action early in the second quarter to reduce our cost base, and we'll be taking continuing actions as we bring our E&C model back into alignment. The Mobile Solution segment produced unimpressive year-to-year growth in the second quarter. While there are some specific business portfolios on operational issues that have impacted the short term growth rate, the fundamental market outlook for this business is the strongest it has been since we entered the market in 2001. Increases in fuel prices and other costs are putting significant pressure on the economics of manager's of vehicle fleet and mobile work forces. As a result, our sales pipeline and qualified leads were substantially higher than it... at any point in the past. And the six months since the end of 2007, this perspective sales pipeline has quadrupled and consist of a comparative weight long list of companies. While we need to land these deal against competition, we believe we can demonstrate significant increases in revenues, number of subscribers and profitability in 2009 based on in sales pipeline. We did not demonstrate the full potential for Mobile Solutions business in the second quarter for a number of reasons. The single largest reason for the lack is significant revenue growth in quarter was the handled field service and direct store delivery business we have discussed in the past. As we discussed, we effectively withdrew from this market in the latter part of 2007 until we have a compelling solution. We began to rollout our platform product to mobile application platform at the end of 2007, and has been building sales pipeline across that's during 2008. This is generally an enterprise sale and is dead and it has taken some time to fully develop the pipeline into a revenue stream. Because we have not yet replaced the sales of the old product which was still selling in second quarter of 2007, we saw a substantial revenue drop-off in this product category for the quarter compared to the prior year. Because of revenue drop in this product category, the Mobile Solutions segment would have demonstrated a double digit year-to-year revenue increase in second quarter. Operating margins for the Mobile Solution segment were also unimpressive. Part of the margin pressure resulted from continuing to run R&D high within the segment. We expect to get relief from the higher spending during 2009. Overall, we are approaching the issues Mobile Solutions margin improvement, as an exercise in segmentation in which we break that Mobile Solutions segment down into a number of distinct businesses that are operating at different performance levels. A significant majority of the segment is generating very healthy margin. In the second quarter, the core businesses that accounted for 87% of the segments revenue generated operating margins of approximately 20%. These businesses include construction supply, free productivity, Telco [ph] and public safety. Three intra segment businesses lost money and drag down the total segments margin into single digits. We're being reasonably patient with these losing businesses because we believe each have significant revenue potential within the next 12 months to 18 months, and because we understand the path to bringing them up to Trimble's average operating margin. The three businesses that are losing money are the Handheld Field service and direct store delivery business, the transportation and distribution business, and our Asia Pacific initiatives. We believe we have pictures in place for both the Handheld base business and the transportation and distribution business and that we grow... leave 2008 with significant momentum. In the Asia Pacific business we are... sales pipeline build with expected improvements in 2009 and a significant financial payoff in 2010. Another source upside in this segment is the potential for significant additional operational improvements at @Road. Although we have already seen meaningful improvements, we can expect to see additional improvements as we continue our initiatives to bring out @Road to the operational and financial standards for the rest of Trimble, by focusing on reducing churn, improving customer satisfaction, establishing clear that balance inflow priorities, decreasing selling productivity and achieving greater synergies with the rest of Trimble. One outcome of these initiatives thus far is that we have reduced @Road headcount by 20% while increasing revenue by more than 20% since the acquisition. Company wide the second quarter did not reflect Trimble's traditions of revenue growth coupled with the expansion of operating margins which were flat year-to-year. Some of this was results of external market conditions. Some of it our decision to continue investments in markets that have strong control, strong 12 to 128 months revenue potential, and some it was that our costs and revenue that came inline. We believe we have adjusted exchange certain potential and we'll make further adjustment as required. Our assessment of our three year prospects remains unchanged. Our continued growth depends on executing in number of key areas. One of these areas is our commitment to international growth. We intend to drive each of our businesses towards an international profile of take advantage of major worldwide trends which includes the massive infrastructure build-out taking place in emerging economies. The increase in pressure to increase food output, the increase comps for transportation and the growing emphasis on environmentally friendly practices. We are seeing and expect to continue to see very strong growth in China, India, Russia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. Another area of focus is the pursuit of adjacencies to our existing market position. The adjacencies take the form of either breaking the new products to our existing customers, or applying our capabilities to entirely new customer groups. Let me give you one recent example; yesterday we announced a new forestry product that extends the capabilities developed in the Mobile Solutions segment into the E&C market space. They consists of application software developed in E&C, delivered to the user via the service platform from within the Mobile Solution segment. The size of the addressable market for this recurring service model has the potential to reach tens of thousands of vehicles worldwide, and between $100 million and $200 million a year of annual revenue. The solution minimizes distance traveled from transporting timber from cutting sites to mills. Our field tests lead us to believe our solution will be used distance travel by 10% to 15%. With the resulting fuel and capital savings, we believe we can generate a significant savings to the customer, while returning strong margins to Trimble. In addition to extending our addressable market by exploring adjacencies and by pursuing new international markets, we have substantial growth still available to us in our current core markets, which remain largely un-penetrated. These growth paths enable us to look beyond current economic circumstances with undiminished confidence in growing this company. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Good afternoon. In the second quarter of 2008, revenue was $377.8 million, up approximately 15% or from revenue of $327.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. Operating income for the second quarter of 2008 was $62.9 million up 1% from the second quarter of 2007. Operating margins in the second quarter of 2008 were 16.7%, down slightly from margins of 17.1% in the second quarter of 2007. Excluding amortization of intangibles, stock base compensation expense and restructuring expense, non-GAAP operating income of $81 million was up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating margins were 21.4% in the second quarter of 2008, approximately flat compared to 21.5% in the second quarter of 2007, reached out 21%, of the increase in revenue due to operating income line. Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $48.6 million up 39% compared to net income of $35 million in the second quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2008 was $0.39, up 39% from the diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in the second quarter of 2007. The tax rate for the second quarter 2008 was 28% compared to 38% in the second quarter of 2007. The lower tax rate is due to the previously announced implementation of the global supply chain structure. We now expect a full year tax rate to be at 31% versus previous guidance of 33%. This is due to a high mix of international profits versus U.S. profits. Adjusting for them additional of intangibles and the impact of stock base compensation and restructuring expenses, non-GAAP net income of $61.7 million for the second quarter of 2008 was up 40% compared to non-GAAP net income of $44.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of 2008 were $0.49 up 5% from non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 in the second quarter of 2007. In the quarter, 53% of revenue was in North America, 26% in Europe, 15% in Asia Pacific and 6% in the rest of the world. This represents growth rates of 8% in North America, 15% in Europe, 38% in Asia Pacific and 48% in rest of the world. We are clearly becoming an increasingly diversified company, both from a geographical and as from a segment point-of-view. Excluding our @Road business, international revenue in the second quarter represented 56% of total revenue versus 46% in the... from a couple of years ago. From a segment perspective, in the second quarter of 2008, E&C represented 56% of revenue versus 69%, versus three years ago. Turning now to the results by segment which I will cover on the underline on a non-GAAP basis. This excludes general corporate expenses, amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges. In addition for each segment, non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of stock base compensation expense. Engineering and construction revenue was $213 million, up approximately 7%, when compared to revenue of $198.9 million, in the second quarter of 2007. International sales continue to be strong, but were partially offset by store conditions in the U.S. Additionally, the year-over-year comparison is difficult, because of the second quarter of 2007 at strong revenue growth rate of 18%. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $46.2 million or 21.7% of revenue, compared to $53.2 million or 26.7% revenue in the second quarter of 2007. As in the first quarter of 2008, the decline in the operating margins resulted from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, the impact of recent acquisitions, product mix, and an overhead structure that was not aligned with lower revenue growth rate. During the quarter, we took a restructuring charge which will reduce the overhead structure going forward, and we expect E&C margins to expand in the fourth quarter and beyond. Field solution revenue was $90.1 million, up approximately 63% compared to revenue of $55.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong demand from agricultural products. Non-GAAP operating income in EMS was $25 million, or 38.9% of revenue, compared with $18.6 million, or 33.6% of revenue in the second quarter of 2007. Operating margin expansion came from operating leverage, resulting from increased revenue. Mobile solutions revenue was $42.3 million up approximately 3% when compared to revenue of $40.9 million in the second quarter of 2007. The revenue increase was driven by @Road partially offset by declined in the Direct Store Delivery business. Non-GAAP operating income in EMS was $3.1 million or 7.4% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 10.8% of revenue in the second quarter of 2007. Operating income was lower due to increase losses from the Direct Store Delivery business, as well as the fact that it continued to invest aggressively in the segment, particularly R&D as utilizes the new products. These effect investments with a backlog stability this year with margin expansion expected in 2009. An additional point to note is that there are three discrete investments that are driving the lower margin in this business. If we turn these investments off today, this could be 20% margin business immediately. Advanced Devices revenue were $32.4 million approximately flat when compared to revenue of $32.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices were $6.9 million or 21.3% of revenue compared to $5.7 million, on 17.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2007. Improvements in margins were due product mix and overhead efficiencies. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the company in the second quarter of 2008 came in at $113.3 million or 30% of revenue compared to 31.2% of revenue in the second quarter of 2007. Non-operating income for the second quarter of 2008 was $4.1 million versus $271,000 in the second quarter of 2007. This improvement was due to lower interest expense and higher profit from the CTCT joint venture. Now turning to the balance sheet, we finished the second quarter of 2008 with $79.8 million in cash compared to $71.4 million in the first quarter of 2008. In the second quarter, we generated a record $80 million in cash flow from operations, which we used to take $60 million in debts and buyback stock. We now have no debt outstanding on our credit facility. In the second quarter, net accounts receivable were $267.2 million compared to $280.7 million in first quarter of 2008. Day sales outstanding were down by 8 days to 64 compared to first quarter of 2008 and down by 1 day compared to second quarter of 2007. Inventory were a $153.4 million compared to $148.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Returns were 4.5 times slightly higher than the first quarter. In January, we announced a stock repurchase program for up to $250 million. As far as this program, in the first quarter of 2008, we repurchased approximately 968,000 shares of Trimble's stock, at an average price of $26.71. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 287,000 shares at an average price of $36.25. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased an additional 741,000 shares, at an average price of $33.18. Let me discuss our guidance before we take your questions. In the third quarter of 2008, we expect revenue to grow 13% to 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2007, with revenue between $335 million, and $340 million. We expect third quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share between $0.26 and $0.28, and non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.34 and $0.36. Non GAAP guidance for the third quarter of 2008 excludes amortization of intangibles of $10.9 million directly with acquisitions, and anticipated impact of stock base compensation expense of $3.8 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance use a 31% tax rate, and is due 125.7 million shares outstanding. We have modified our full year 2008 guidance to incorporate the lower tax rate of 31%. Revenue for the full year 2008 is expected to grow 15% to 17%. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $1.54 to $1.59, versus previous guidance of $1.50 to $1.55. Thank you. We will now take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: Thank you, good afternoon. Steve in your prepared remarks, I thought you mentioned that Europe you were seeing some slowness in E&C. And just wanted to clarify if that was the case? And if that is the case, I think last quarter you mentioned that the U.S. exposure of E&C was about 20% of total of revenue. If you added Europe to that, what would that bring as a percentage of your total revenue?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Relatively to the breakup, I don't have the number readily at hand. But I think what we were... I think last quarter we talked conversationally about UK and Ireland and elements of Spain having seen the effects. I think the environment in Europe is more uncertain today than it was three months ago without a doubt. I think today's data would support. And so I think that we've become more cautious about Europe than maybe we were three months ago, at least publicly, I think we were already cautious about Europe three months ago and we're hedging our expectations a bit, not knowing what was exactly going on in Europe. So I think it's hard to be definitive about elements of Europe. I think Eastern Europe is one story. I think Germany and France are another story and the UK, Ireland and Spain are kind of suffering from post bubble relative collapse in some ways, although there are elements of within those economies that are still positive. So I think that for the moment I'll differ on your question in terms of the 20% number until we can formulate that a little bit more precisely. But we are definitely more cautious about Europe than we were three months ago, and I think we're watching in, although it still has elements of buoyancy depending on which country you're talking about.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: That's helpful. And one more if I could on @Road. In the period... sort of the one to two year period prior to when you purchased @Road, they suffered some seemingly pretty significant impacts from an economic slowdown in the U.S. at that time, not withstanding the fact that they are obviously a productivity enhancer, and a fuel saver. Have you seen anything yet in this downturn, that would suggest that enterprises are cutting back or being more judicious about expenditures even on efficiency enhancing products like what @Road provides?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. Actually, I think we're probably seeing the opposite at this point. I think that there maybe some element. And I am sure that as the margins of the market in terms of small fleets and whatever is there. So tendency to react by cutting off everything. So I wont deny that probably at the margins, probably in the smaller fleets, there maybe some falloff from either the real economy or a perception of what might be coming down the road in the economy in the terms of the cutback. But I think overall what we're seeing here is a more blind environment, particularly on what's called the larger fleets. The fleets that are numbered in the hundred to thousands, and I think there is... we may have actually passed through what I would call the inflexion point, and maybe entering at the mainstream. The mainstream sort of thinking at this point of time. So I think that the... the economics... the economic benefits of our solution are now becoming compelling. So again, I think that what we're seeing here is the economic environment and as much kind of inflation induced as anything. I think we're overall seeing a more positive environment and even though there maybe some, some economic turn at the... at the margins.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Company: That's helpful. Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajit Pai from Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Hi good afternoon. Two quick questions. The first one is the just looking at your tax rate right now I think you know in this quarter itself it was lower than was expected and you're lowering the tax rate for the year. Could you give some indication as to with the same trends continuing what that could look like in 2009?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Here Ajit, we have a fairly successful business and we have a supply chain... global supply chain, so we took advantage of that and basically created a structure in Netherlands where our international profits are now residing at a very favorable tax rate. And the reason we lowered our tax rate from 33% to 31% is that international profits... more and more international profits are residing there than what we had forecasted. And as seen a stock, few times that international... growing internationally is a big part of our strategy. And if that strategy is successful, that mix should continue to be the same or could even get better. So at this point, I would expect 2009 to be between 31% to 30% 31... 31% to 32 % with a carrier thing, the mix can change things going forward. But at this point our expectation is to be... the tax rate to be at 31% to 32% for 2009.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. And then just looking at uses of cash because that cash now is going to be a resident overseas. Is the cash... the primary use of the cash as to overseas CapEx, are you planning to grow the company through acquisition overseas? And what is that M&A environment look like overseas? And then also looking at international... second part of that question I think you talked about sort of weakness in the U.S. and somewhat in Europe... parts of Europe. When you're looking at Asia there is been high inflation there and also set of credit tightening by the governments of there because of that. So do you expect that to impact your business in those areas? Or you don't see that impacting things.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: As such the uses of cash is concerned there is a lot cash will be generated in U.S. But you're right the international profits, the cash will reside internationally. And we have strong pipeline of international acquisitions that we are looking at that will use that cash up. For the rest of the question I'll hand it over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.So as far as the outlook for the stock non-North American non-European sales, most of our sale most of our sale... most of our revenue in those regions comes out of the ENCD segment. Agriculture is building, but it does not represent a significant presence there. Our GIS sales are relatively small, Mobile solution sales are relatively smaller, our comp sales are relatively small. So it is largely an Engineering and Construction element. At this point in time and we will continue to be that way for the next year two or three. But kind of change that by building up the rest of the company. But then you look to the funding sources for those E&C sales and it is typically infrastructure build, government funding or in certain regions such as Africa, its international funding. So that funding would not typically be that exposed to our let's call it short term economic fluctuations. So, I think that... I won't be overly confident here. But I think that to a large extend that funding is committed on a multi year basis, with a long term objective in mind, it tend to be government funded. So I think it's relatively immune lets call it short term kind of commercial market fluctuations.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. Thank you so much.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer & Company.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: Hi good afternoon. Have a question on again on the U.S. E&C portion of the business. We're actually on E&C in generally. You mentioned that you thought we may have him in deflection point in this starting next quarter, revenues could actually... growth could accelerate. Is that a reflection of the fact that U.S. E&C has been weak now for I guess some time? Or is it also reflection that you really think we've kind of hit a bottom or close to it here in the States? and I guess the follow up to that would be when you look at Europe, may realize you got to slowed down there, as to really early stages. Do you think we could have as much downside to that market as we've seen here in the U.S.?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: So relative to the U.S., what you should not be doing is using Trimble as declaring that there's a profound change in economic direction here. I think that there are some specific... we believe there are maybe some specific... there are some issues specific to Trimble that allows to show, let's call very guarded optimism here, and we qualify this fairly heavily, and still a very uncertain situation, pretty dynamic. But part of it is yes, just from a calculations standpoint, if you look at... if you look at the last year in particular, first half, second half, second half was materially weaker than the first half in terms kind of revenue robust. And so we do get a need easier comp in the second half of this year then we do to the second period, compared to second half last year. So we get somewhat from that alone. I would say there are other things that we are doing that we are not necessarily talking about that have the possibility as we get deeper into the second half of the year into 2009 that could provide some lift. So we believe we have the potential to take our own destiny in our hands to a certain extent here. And... so this represents the bottoms up view of where we think we stand. It's heavily qualified depending on what happens to the U.S. economy in particular. But we... both because we have an easier comp, but also because we think we are taking specific actions that may have, have some effect out there. We do see the ability to start to may be show some of better performance than we have. Relatively... relative to Europe I just do not speculate. Again I think that the situation is fluid, we're not... our 4-K [ph] as a company is not necessary making great macroeconomic projections. I just do not get into that business. We will react aggressively to what we see in the marketplace and we'll work to succeed whatever the market condition. But aside from that I think I'll dodge that particular question.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: Fair enough. And then if I may have a different follow-up. This is more on the side of competition. I'm just wondering how the conditions here in the U.S., I guess increasing in Europe are kind of impacting the competitive dynamic and potentially pricing and also what is the competition like, in some of newer regions where your growing a lot. Is the same competitors and are you seeing a certain of your rivals doing better than others?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So first of all if we restrict it to the Engineering and Construction segment the competitive ground is actually pretty narrow. There is, Topcon, there is a like a flash hexagon [ph] and then in China there tends to be a little more un-grown competition. But I think it's fair to say that the margins of the market during a downturn pricing become pretty intensive at times. But in both my script and Raj script, what you didn't hear us taking about in terms the reasons for the drop in operating was pricing. Yes there is some pricing pressure. But I believe is largely tactical at this point in time. It doesn't represent necessarily represent a distinct structural strategic change in pricing levels. So we will of course be looking into in the marketplace. But again, I don't see at this point in time anyway, there has been a structural change in pricing. As far as the new regions, I think it gets to be a pretty complex... again restricting it to the Engineering and Construction, same group competitors. But I think it plays out country by country, in it's own unique fashion. Some places, one competitor, another has an historical position. But I would say in general, we are pleased in these developing economies. We're pleased with our position. We continue to act very quick at resources in each of those markets. So I would say in general... ask me again the same question, in two, three years, and I'll have a more precise answer. But at this point in time, it is all of these markets are performing well. I don't think there is a... I won't claim absolute a shift for Trimble is what we are targeting. But I think its still early days in all of these markets and the answers are yet to be evolve there.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: Great. Thank you and have software on the nice results.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarden with Longbow Securities.
Eli Lustgarden - Longbow Securities: Good afternoon. A very nice quarter. A couple of quick questions, one the ad business. Should we... I know it should stay strong for an extended period of time, but we shouldn't seen normal seasonality in the second half, with some degree that we have versus the first half? And then is that a fair commentary at this point?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Raj may have some color, but I would say is that I think we are still a seasonal company. It's getting to be harder. To be honest its getting harder to... its becoming more of an art form to actually determine full effects of the seasonality. But again construction and... the E&C segment will tend to have the strongest quarter in the second quarter that would be tend to be strong as in first quarter and into the second quarter. And... so the second half is generally less blank than first half of the seasonality perceptive. Ral any--
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. The total company perspective that's right on first half tends to have more revenue driven by E&C. But I think your question was on the act side Eli and quarter-to-quarter we are lucky to see strong double digit growth in ads. The ad environment is solid. It continues to be very good for us. So from a value end perspective these solutions should continue to deliver strong digit growth rates. But having said, yes first half is more stronger from absolute revenue point of view.
Eli Lustgarden - Longbow Securities: And there is nothing structural capacity limitation that would prevent showing very good strengths in 2009 at this point. We are in the pipeline filling the product or something like that distributed.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No I don't think, I think we've seen the market continuing strong and there are no what I would call stressful constraints to meeting that market. So I think the question it's just after relatively predicted results in 2008, the question is what's probably on 2009. But certainly there is nothing that I would identify as being kind of a constraint to continuing robust environment.
Eli Lustgarden - Longbow Securities: We'll follow-up, I mean on their Trimble long enough to know that I wouldn't put a macro environment typically in E&C business. But then alluded to things that you're doing that should make as you look out better... somewhat improving E&C. Can you go through some of those things because from a macro environment E&C and in a high risk construction goes down a lot over the six months to nine months and we actually getting from you're caterpillars and all that stuff is well cutting production in the second half into next year. So I mean could you disconnected, that we have to appreciate, I don't think you can go through go to some of things that with that perspective?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So again how is this in conservative terms since we're not pumping the table, we're not pumping our chests, declaring that we're totally kind of cyclical here. So again residential doesn't tend to be a like third order market force. So it has affected us. In fact that's not a primary driver. So I think it's less to do with the market than discrete individual actions, we maybe able to take to improve our position in the marketplace. And those, Eli I think again we're not banking big number on these but we believe that there will be something that we can point to not now but in future quarters that will have a lead to a little bit more optimal involved.
Eli Lustgarden - Longbow Securities: I guess, I'm trying to get some color on that I mean I certainly has something to do with the product, product migration, something I just trying to get them feel to what those kind of things may look like as we look foward.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I mean there are range of actions that we can take. Some have to do with product, some have to do with improving the distribution channel. And I would say that the actions I'm talking about would take place in those two grounds.
Eli Lustgarden - Longbow Securities: Alright. Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Friedland with Soleil Group.
Peter Friedland - Soleil Group: Hi. Talk about OpEx it looks like you grew that line of 10% year-over-year in Q2. So what's the best way to think about the growth rate for those lines going forward?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. On the OpEx side it's grew 10% but there were lot of factors. Foreign exchange, for ForEx the dollar weakened though, of that, OpEx was up $30 million, so $4 million was driven by up by ForEx, $2 million was driven by acquisitions. We also had a restructuring reserve that we didn't have last year that was another $2 million on top of last year. So on an organic basis, the OpEx was up just 4%, versus prior year. And if you look at our headcount, actually it was down. We have a report, we have a chart at the end of the press release it shows the headcount was 3,627 people at the end of Q2, and it was 3715 at the end of Q1. We took some specific actions during the quarter to know the headcount. So I think going forward you could expect our moral to be the same. Operating expenses drawing at lower rate than revenue and that just completely give us leverage going forward.
Peter Friedland - Soleil Group: And then a gross margin, I think you should just talk about what it looks like sequentially into Q3 and some of that year?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Gross margins are, again is back to the performance this quarter, so there is a slight decline in some product mix also impacted this quarter. But I think if you look at from a year-over-year perspective we should see gross margins, plus minus in the range of one point depending upon product mix and product change rate, we should expect it to be in a plus minus, you could expect flattish gross margins on an ongoing basis. Plus minus one point.
Peter Friedland - Soleil Group: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: You're next question comes from the line of Corey Tobin with William Blair.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick things, I'll start with a housekeeping question, Raj what's your account are you incorporating into both the third quarter and the full year guidance?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So for the second quarter, we ended up at $145.7 million shares and we are based on the buyback program that we had. We are basically saying it will offset the dilution that happens during the third quarter, so we are forecasting $125.7 million in the third quarter as well and again if we keep on doing the buyback, you could expect it to be $125.7 million in the fourth quarter and inside that is as you know it expect it also depends on what happens to our stock price and what happens to the out of in the money options. This besides variation for forecasting purposes I would say $125.7 in Q2, $125.7 in Q3, and $125.7 in Q4.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Excellent, okay. And then shifting gears back to the into seven for a minute. Steve you mentioned in some statistics you gave in your prepared remarks that the company in whole is heavily weighted outside the U.S. when you remove @Road which is there is pretty interesting to see those numbers. Can you give us a little bit more granularity is there anyway to break out a rough geographic mix specifically for E&C?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm not sure that there is a magic formula you can drive from the outside I think that what we've characterized E&C as being as more international than the rest of Trimble and that Trimble currently is roughly a 50-50 deal U.S. to non-U.S. so what we're doing is implying that E&C is larger outside the U.S. relatively larger outside of the U.S. when it is to U.S. and this point of time I'm not sure we're willing to go into much more clarity on that but maybe in the future just make it clear or maybe we won't.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Is that take that assume out at the percentage coming from outside the U.S. and E&C is significantly up year-over-year at this point?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's a safe assumption, that's a very safe assumption.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Okay. And then along the same lines you mentioned last quarter and couple of previous quarters that you are ramping enough distribution there. Can you give us a feeling for I guess the number of dealers that you're currently or selling through overseas and where that number was about a year ago or so?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Not, something I carry around with me, kind of ready to answer. I think in the answer maybe would even if I gave you the answer I think it might be a little bit misleading so for because I think the style internationally is larger more substantial dealers than we see in the U.S. or New York does I think we have lots of dealer in U.S. and lots of dealers in Europe, whereas in China the number of dealers for example E&C would be less than 10. And a part of this is learning that we've down elsewhere in world in terms its important well financed dealer organizations. So I'm not sure that would be necessarily be a meaningful metric in another self. But I think it's more a matter of quality of dealer, the relative financing of the dealer. The ability of Trimble to the support that dealer and as aggressively as we need to make them successful and I would say that across the world as we're putting with the Trimble we are putting much Trimble players into play and our dealer capability is increasing kind of proportionally.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Just to wrap up on that point. As you look ahead to the next twelve months, next 24 months, whatever the timeframe might be. Can you give us a sense where the magnitude in increase in number of dealers you hope to take on, or is it something that could grow by 50% double, is there any sort of internal goal you guys have?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. I mean again kind of back to characterizing it, and the answer varies from business to business in Trimble. So in the engineering and construction, I think for the machine control and for the high end surveillance for example, that tends to be a relatively exclusive dealer channel where there is a dealer with the geography, and there is a need for that dealer to be relatively muscular in terms of financing, because there is a level of support, there is a level of capability that's required. So it's less the matter of how many dealers we have under that channel than the quality of the dealers. Now for other businesses, for example, ad tends to be by it's nature a multi tier, multi channel sort of distribution process, and so there the number of dealers would tend to be more meaningful in terms of...its important to have lots of outlets there, for things like GIS and some of these other businesses, again, it come comes back to being more of a quality dealer than anything else, and then again at the low end construction and low end survey realms, I probably shouldn't use the world low end, but for those class of products, it does tend to get back to more of a how many distribution points do you have, and if the user has a need, is there a readily available supply So I think the. I'm dodging the question just because I think if it's, if I gave you raw statistics, it wouldn't necessarily need to a truthful answer.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson with Dougherty [ph] and Company.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. I wonder to figure if you will just unpack your outlook on Field solution here and then also look at the quarter whether market share gains, whether specific products geographies that really broader that out or is this more of a total macro environment that's allowing you to put up these kinds of numbers?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I will give you the simple mind of the answer and then I'll to refine it a bit, but the simple minded answer was everywhere and in everything to some extent. So we have what we would consider on internally four internal product classes if you will with any AG. One is the in it, one is the autopilot product, which is a highly automated relatively expensive product offering that had outstanding success and it had outstanding success in kind of all the relevant geographies. The next class of product is our lightbar class product which is...gives the operator key just to turn left and right, same thing based on this easy guiding 500 product that we introduced a year ago. We had outstanding results there and again it was broad based geographically and like... did we have small, much smaller category of water management that gets to be interesting strategically in this water short world of ours. That also promotes smaller base, also should show very good growth. That tends to me a little bit more geographically selective, but there for example we, places like China become much more relevant for that product class right here, right at this moment of time. But again strong success. And the four categories is a still smaller category that will showed probably the most significant percentage growth. It was triple digit number, but was flow control, so we announced that product in the latter part of 2006, our entry into flow controls, which is extending out taking advantage of the fact that we have GPS receiver on the tractor, and a computer on the tracker and expending it out our farther into the farm operation. But while we have seen in the...certainly the last two quarters was a triple digit growth from a small base but getting significant attraction on that product as well so. Pretty much everywhere and everything.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then I wanted to talk again about ENC operating margins and you guys said that you can see them expanding from here I wonder where that is the revenue growth level, the gross margin levels if the product mix improves and how fast that product mix will improve for you guys. Where do you see the leverage there?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well I think we are starting out from the bottoms up and Raj add any color here. But certainly we are on the expense side kind of the lines between gross margin and operating we are definitely in hunter down mode at this point of time. Raj talked to cutting back costs in the early part of the second quarter so what we are doing there very consciously very methodically it is saying okay. With the current product mix that we're generating and the gross margin that results from that what is the appropriate level spending on R&D, marketing, selling, administrative and we are working backwards to it actually define find the missing corporate level spending. I think that product mix is relatively key here we talked in terms of the fact that the, there has been a shift in product next year ahead is producing at least for the moment, a lower gross margin in ANC. I think there are things that we think we can do over the next six or nine months to improve that product mix, which would tend to lift gross margin. But we will not..., we're not counting on here is necessarily the walking of the [Indiscernible], but what we're not counting down here is a revival in the overall economy.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you and then one question on TMS here. It sounds like you guys, you are making the investments, and you have the horizon of the next 12 to 18 months for those to pay off. I wonder if you can just put the metrics around the what the opportunity is there in terms of mobile workers, the fleet, really where the hockey [ph] stick is for you guys there and what we can kind of think about going forward?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I don't know that we want to all that specific in terms of dollarizing this, but I'll give you hopefully a helpful hand. I made the reference to the fact that in terms of opportunities we're sitting in front of somebody whose going to make a bind decision say in the next six months. This... what we're seeing is a unprecedented level of interest in this class of product out there, so we don't; give subscriber... level of subscribers out there but I would say we're currently involved in discussions that involves six figure numbers in total in terms of numbers subscribers out there which would be if you work it through in terms of success rate and all that could be a safe case significant pump to our both out returning revenues as well as the revenues for the segment. overall. Beyond that I think it's characterize it, but too closely but I think the environment is ....has shifted and again I think that we are seeing an inflexion point. I would not describe it is a hockey stick though as we've [Indiscernible] long ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc: Yes, Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan. Good afternoon, couple of questions. You said in your previous comments you said that there is like a 4X increase in the mobile solution pipeline. Can you talk about where we are on the sales cycle, because we have not seen he revenue yet. Is it along the sales cycles or is it [Indiscernible] in the next few quarters?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well again I made a specific reference to the pipeline and talked about 2009 so I don't think it would be smart to assume that there is going to be pop from this activity in 2008. So I can desert activity in 2008 so again these tend to be enterprise level sales so they work to a deliberate process so some of them are relatively link stage, some are relatively early stage but that I well I would say is that I with would expect to fall into 2009 rather than 2008 in terms of volume I most of this pipeline.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc: Okay. My same question E&C side we have seen little bit of weakness domestically. You're moving to some pockets of Europe that you mentioned earlier. How would character the isolation I the emerging market from what's happening here in parts of Europe and the U.S.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again as I as I said earlier is that I think that emerging market tend work to a different funding source. There is much less what I will call passive and in fact in some country there is virtually no commercial business that tied to private developers and private sources of funding. It is...it tends to be much more even government or international financing and then so I think that again it is in this environment it is hard to say anything categorically but I would say is that the emerging markets will tend to operate to a different rhythm than either U.S. or Europe.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc: Okay, great. Thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: You are welcome.
Operator: And you have no further questions at this time. At this time I will turn the call back over to leaders' the for closing remarks.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. No closing remarks. But thank you for attending and talk to you next quarter. Thanks.

Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon. Trimble generated strong financial results in the March quarter based on exceptional performance from our agriculture business and continued robust international growth in all segments. Year-over-year revenue growth of 24% enabled us to continue our expansion of non-GAAP operating margin, which was further enhanced by a structural drop in our tax rate versus expectations. Our first quarter performance, the tax rate effect and our expectations for the remainder of the year will allow Raj to maintain our general revenue outlook for the year while raising our annual earnings guidance. The quarter reflected the evolving Trimble business portfolio. Because of the higher growth rates in mobile solutions and field solutions over the last several years, the Engineering & Construction segment fell to less than 55% of total revenue in the quarter, down from 65% in the first quarter two years ago. Beyond that, the significant majority of E&C sales are outside the US, which means that only approximately 20% of Trimble's total revenue is directly exposed to the slowdown in the U.S. construction market. The elements of our Agriculture story remain consistent, and are centered on strong commodity prices, the need to mitigate high input costs for fuel and fertilizer and strong product innovation. Beyond those factors, we're seeing a rapid evolution of the market beyond our historical core geographies of North America, Brazil and Australia with new regions such as Europe, growing at triple-digit rates. We believe, we can sustain strong performance in this business for the foreseeable future, because the underlying market drivers are not likely to subside and since we believe the addressable market remains less than 30% penetrated worldwide. For the entire company, international growth remains a key and growing element of our strategy. Today, the survey instruments business is our only truly internationalized business with roughly a third of its revenue falling into each of the geographic categories of North America, Europe and rest of world. We continue to push each of our other businesses towards this profile to take advantage of major worldwide trends, which includes the massive infrastructure build out taking place in emerging economies, the increasing pressure to increase food output and the growing emphasis on environmentally friendly practices. We're seeing and expect to continue to see very strong growth in China, India, Russia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, central Asia and Southeast Asia. The three logical questions for us relating to first quarter performance revolve around sequential development in the Mobile Solutions segment, US market conditions in the Engineering & Construction segment and margins in the Engineering & Construction segment. Let me address each of these and leave a more detailed explanation to Raj. In the January call, we discussed the special circumstances that led to the very strong results for the Mobile Solutions segment in the fourth quarter and urged that it not be used as a new baseline for the business. The fourth quarter included a number of large contracts for which we were able to recognize the revenue within the quarter. In the first quarter we did not have those same beneficial effects. While the first quarter reflected year-over-year progression in Mobile Solutions operating margins, they are not yet at the targeted level. The largest impact on operating margins in the Mobile Solutions segment continues to be the field, service and direct store delivery business, which generated a quarterly loss of over $1 million and is taking approximately 3 margin points off the table for the segment. We came to the conclusion in early 2007 that we did not have a compelling product solution for this market and, effectively, we withdrew from that market until we did. We began to roll out our new platform product, the mobile application platform product, the mobile application platform, which I've been referring to as V4, late in 2007 and are beginning to build a sales pipeline. Because this is generally an enterprise sale it will take some time to fully develop the pipeline into a revenue stream. We're being patient in this effort because we consider this to be a significant opportunity for us to use this product platform to access between 7 million and 10 million mobile workers worldwide. We also believe that in the MAP platform, we have a compelling offering that can achieve a significant competitive advantage as we roll out its full capabilities. We have already landed a premiere consumer packaged goods company as our flagship account for the product. Another area where we expect significant operating margin expansion is from @Road. We have intensified our efforts to bring @Road up to the operational and financial standards of the rest of Trimble during the last six months. These efforts are focused on reducing churn, improving customer satisfaction, establishing clearer developmental priorities, increasing selling productivity and achieving greater synergies with the rest of Trimble. This should accelerate the improvement in operating margins we have already seen from @Road. Another source of future margin expansion in the Mobile Solutions segment is in R&D spending. We are consciously driving R&D spending at a hot level, near 20% of revenue in order to extend and internationalize our products. As R&D spending converges on a more typical Trimble profile, we expect that we can add multiple margin points to segment results. With the combined effects of turning the Field Service business into a contributor, achieving @Road's profit potential and bringing R&D costs into line with our model, we believe we are on a credible path to bring this segment to our target operating margin of greater than 20%. In the first quarter, we continued to see slower conditions in the US construction market, which impacted the E&C growth rate in the first quarter. The slower results in the US are a result of the combination of a slower economy, which is impacting new construction starts, a late spring in some parts of the US and the decision by uncertain contractors to defer buying decisions until there's a greater understanding of the extent of the troubles in the financial markets. These market issues continue to be counteracted by continuing strong growth in international markets. Our internal planning and guidance for the rest of the year presumes the US market does not recover and that we will face a difficult construction market for the rest of the year. While acknowledging the general lack of clarity on the state of the economy, and also acknowledging that it could get worse, we also believe we may have reasons for guarded optimism for the E&C segment in the second half of the year. This view is based on the potential that if the uncertainty associated with the financial crisis subsides, we can deal with the underlying recessionary conditions more effectively. In addition, we have action plans underway in the market that can also have a significant beneficial effect. Uncharacteristically for us, E&C operating margins as a percentage of revenue declined year-to-year. Some of this was a matter of the relative measurement framework as the operating margins for E&C in the first quarter of last year reflected an increase of 6 points from 2006, which represented a non-sustainable benchmark. Some of this was environmental as rapidly fluctuating exchange rates materially affected the operating margin metric as E&C has significant elements of its cost structure outside the US. Some of it was internal as our cost structure has become somewhat misaligned with the level of revenues. We have begun aggressive cost containment actions to restore the balance between revenue and cost and we should be returning to our traditional pattern of margin progression within the segment during the year. Stepping back beyond the current economic confusion, we remain comfortable and confident with our multiyear outlook. Our story remains centered on being a highly innovative Company that brings compelling value to significant unpenetrated markets. Short term, we are reaffirming the 2008 picture based on our best updated judgment of current circumstances and what we believe we can do to mitigate economic conditions. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Good afternoon. In the first quarter of 2008, revenue was $355.3 million, up approximately 24% from revenue of $285.7 million in the first quarter of 2007. Operating income was $58 million, up 48% from the first quarter of 2007. Operating margins in the first quarter of 2008 were 16.3% compared to 13.7% in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding amortization of intangibles, in-process research and development, the impact of stock-based compensation expense, our restructuring and amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, non-GAAP operating income of $73 million grew by 32% compared to the first quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating margins were 20.5% in the first quarter of 2008, up from 19.4% in the first quarter of 2007. We dropped 25% of the increase in revenue due to operating income line. Net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $40.1 million, up 40% compared to net income of $28.7 million in the first quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 were $0.32, up 35% from the diluted earnings per share of $0.24 in the first quarter of 2007. The tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 33% compared to 32% in the first quarter of 2007. Trimble's tax rate was lower than forecasted due to the implementation of a global supply chain structure which is expected to result in a structural tax rate of 33% for fiscal 2008 and beyond. Adjusting for the amortization of intangibles, in-process research and development, impact of stock-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP net income of $50.1 million for the first quarter of 2008 was up 26% compared to non-GAAP net income of $39.6 million in the first quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 were $0.40, up 22% from non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 in the first quarter of 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, we continued to see strong revenue growth internationally, with 54% of revenue in North America, 26% in Europe, 13% in Asia-Pacific, and 7% in the rest of the world. This represents growth rates of 16% in North America, 25% in Europe, 54% in Asia Pacific and 54% in rest of the world. I will now discuss the results by segment, both on an underlying and reported basis. Please note that segment operating income excludes general corporate expenses, amortization of intangibles, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up and in-process research and development. In addition, for each segment, non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense. First-quarter 2008 earnings in Engineering & Construction revenue was $194.2 million, up approximately 11% when compared to revenue of $175.6 million in the first quarter of 2007 with strong international sales. First-quarter 2008 operating income for E&C was $37 million or 19% of revenue compared to $42.2 million or 24% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $37.9 million or 19.5% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $43 million or 24.5% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. We expected first-quarter comps to be difficult given that margins in the first quarter of 2007 expanded by 6 points year-over-year from 18.7% to 24.5%, clearly an unsustainable trend. The decline in operating margin in the first quarter was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of recent acquisitions and product mix. In anticipation of a continuing slow U.S. economy, we're taking steps to reduce our costs to generate improved margins regardless of the state of the economy. We currently expect E&C operating margins to expand year-over-year in the back half of 2008. First quarter 2008 Field Solutions revenue was $88 million, up approximately 73% when compared to revenue of $51 million in the first quarter of 2007. Sales were strong across all regions and product lines, with the majority of the increase coming from the Agriculture business. First-quarter 2008 operating income in TFS was $35.1 million or 39.9% of revenue compared to $16.6 million or 32.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in TFS was $35.3 million or 40.1% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $16.8 million or 33% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Operating margin expansion was due primarily to high revenue. First-quarter 2008 Mobile Solutions revenue was $44 million, up approximately 47% when compared to revenue of $29.9 million in the first quarter of 2007. First-quarter 2008 operating income in TMS was $2.5 million or 5.6% of revenue compared to $1 million or 3.4% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in TMS was $3.9 million or 8.8% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $1.8 million or 5.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Operating margin expansion was driven by higher subscription revenues and operating synergies, which were partially offset by higher new product development costs. Non-GAAP operating margins declined sequentially because the fourth quarter of 2007 benefited from completion of a large customer contract. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2008, the DSD business continued to be a drag on the margin with the loss of over $1 million in this business. In spite of the inherent lumpiness of the overall business and the DSD impact, we expect to improve operating margins in the TMS segment for the full year with margin improvement in each of the quarters except the second quarter of 2008. First-quarter 2008 Advanced Devices revenue was $29.1 million, approximately flat when compared to revenue of $29.3 million in the first quarter of 2007. First-quarter 2008 operating income in Advanced Devices was $4.7 million or 16.1% of revenue compared to $3.3 million or 11.4% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $5 million or 17.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $3.7 million or 12.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Margins improved due to product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2008 came in at $107.7 million or 30.3% of revenue compared to 32.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007. Non-operating income for the first quarter of 2008 was $1.8 million versus $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2007, due primarily to lower interest income on lower average cash balances and slightly lower income from the CTCT joint venture. Now, turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter of 2008 with $71.4 million in cash, compared to $103.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. In the quarter, the cash balance declined as we paid $39.6 million for acquisitions and spent $25.9 million to buyback 968,000 shares of Trimble's stock at an average purchase price of $26.7 million. Debt remains flat at approximately $61 million in the first quarter, but it should be noted that we are paying off $35 million of additional debt in the month of April. In the first quarter, net accounts receivable were $280.7 million, compared to $239.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. DSOs were flat at 72 days versus last year. They increased by two days versus Q4 of 2007 due to the inherent seasonality of ag and construction sales skewed to March. In the first quarter of 2008, our deferred revenue balance was $68.5 million, compared to $65.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Inventory was $148.5 million, compared to $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Turns were essentially flat at four times. Let me discuss our guidance before we take our questions. In the second quarter of 2008, Trimble expects revenue to grow 14% to 16%, compared to second quarter of 2007 with revenue between $374 million and $379 million. We expect second quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share between $0.36 and $0.38 and non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.44 and $0.46. Non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of 2008 excludes the amortization of intangibles of $10.9 million related to previous acquisitions and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $3.9 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance use a 33% tax rate and assume 125.9 million shares outstanding. We have modified our full year 2008 guidance to incorporate our current outlook for the year as well as the lower tax rate. Revenue is expected to grow 15% to 17% versus previous guidance of 14% to 17% revenue growth. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be $1.50 to $1.55 versus previous guidance of $1.39 to $1.44. Thank you. We will now take questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Corey Tobin with William Blair.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a very nice quarter.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Corey.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: A couple of quick questions if I could. You mentioned in the E&C segment some impact from foreign exchange. Can you just walk us through exactly some sort of feeling for what the magnitude of the impact was there and how that plays out in your P&L?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Corey, the way it works is that the dollar has weakened, primarily against the euro, and our revenues get a slight uplift because of that, but we have a lot of operating expenses and R&D expenses in Europe. So we get hurt when we translate those expenses back to the US dollars. So net-net on the bottom line we get a slight hurt with nothing -- none of that revenue increase falling to the bottom line. So, hence, our margins get depressed because of that.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Okay, and is there any way that -- can you quantify the benefit to the top line from the foreign exchange?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: For the total Company, it was around 3 to 4 percentage points.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Total Company about 3% to 4%.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: 3 points, around 3 points, yes.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Okay.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Three points of growth.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Great. And then one other if I may, in terms of visibility, can you give any comment on whether or not the visibility has remained about the same in what you've seen in prior years or given the challenges that you've highlighted in the E&C and the domestic business, has the visibility declined in any material way?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would tend to characterize it as being much the same. Depending on the market, it's been variable. So, I would say in general, Mobile Solutions tends to be roughly a little bit better because there's a more discernible pipeline to be looked at. The quarter in which the business may fall is a little bit hypothetical at times, which is why we urge people to look at us in that segment more on a rolling basis than any given quarter. But for the E&C segment, for Field Solutions, I would describe it as basically being the same. I think the first quarter was particularly difficult from a visibility standpoint because I think as I said before, I think there's -- although I guess the recession has been called yet, let's call a recession. There are recessionary conditions out there which are affecting our business. But then, I think there is a bit of a headline factor which also works in. So, for example, in the first quarter, is, we left the CONEXPO show, which was the major US construction show that's held every three years, we left it feeling pretty good. That was on a Friday. On Monday, Bear Stearns news hit. And I believe that it actually shocked buying behavior. I think buying decisions instantly reverted from a Procurement Officer to the Vice President or the President. And so I think that made visibility in the first quarter a tougher at the very end of the quarter. But I would say aside from things like that is that the visibility remains pretty much as it always has been. I don't think it's necessarily gotten worse.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Great, so would you say by the end of the quarter, in terms of sort of linearity, the linearity of the quarter was obviously more front-end loaded toward January and February?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. Typically in the E&C segment is there is a very strong end of quarter seasonality as a contractor's and surveyors, for that matter, are able to get out in the field, which tends to be the last three weeks of March. There does tend to be a very heavy seasonality kick at the end of the quarter. Because we think in part because of the headline effect from Bear Stearns plus the general background, we didn't see quite the kick that we normally see at the end of March. We've taken that depressed level and we baked that into the rest of the year, but I think some of this is as the relative panic about whether the financial system is falling apart maybe starts to pass as we're going to move back into what I would call a more normal buying behavior, which net-net from the way we have it positioned at this point in time might give us some lift.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: And then last one if I could, and just continuing this thought, referring per your guidance that it hasn't deteriorated more since the end of the quarter but rather it stabilized or improved?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sorry, can you say that again, Corey?
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Just inferring from your guidance that it hasn't deteriorated more since the end of the quarter but rather has stabilized or improved? Is that a safe way to look at it?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's only a few weeks into April. I wouldn't necessarily want to characterize it. Let me just say that in terms of in terms of the outlook for the year, we have taken an awfully dim view of the US for the rest of the year and built that into our internal model, so, that's what we are reacting to, that's what we are reacting on, which is a pretty ugly view of the US economy for the rest of the year. And again, I think that if we can get through some of these factors and there gets to be a sense as hey, we're dealing with a traditional recession, not something worse as I think there's some potential lift.
Corey Tobin - William Blair and Company: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer and Company.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer and Company: Hi, Yair from Oppenheimer. Just to follow-up with the last question, have you seen any kind of spillover from kind of the commercial side into the customers who would traditionally be characterized as heavy in highway as a slowdown across the board or are there still some pockets of relative strength in the US?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say that it's still, strangely enough, there are still what I would call pockets in the US And to be honest, the anecdotes are not nearly as negative, as the background economic news in the country is that frankly we have a dealer channel out there that is more optimistic in general with ups and downs, but is more optimistic than maybe we are postured as a Company at this point in time. So I would say there are regions in the country where construction activity is up from -- general sense of construction activity is up from last year. There are others where it's down, there are others where it's confused and there are others that may be saying actually showing relatively a stable environment, so I would say conditions are variable across the US.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer and Company: And in terms of cutting back on some of the expenses to bring the year-on-year kind of margin kind of into the positive growth, what are some of the steps you plan to take?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, to be honest, most of the steps have already been taken, so our view as a Company, the people who run P&Ls in this Company are fundamentally modelers and we've worked to the model. And that's when we got surprised a bit in the first quarter, we took immediate action. So, the actions have taken place across a large number of cost categories; also, in terms of headcount and other cost categories, but we've already taken the actions that we intend to take in E&C, and we believe we've already reset the bar.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer and Company: Okay. One final question then I will get back into queue. Cash flow from operations was a bit light, given the strong top line, a lot of little things down the cash flow statement, any kind of general remarks about when you expect that to reverse?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. It's already reversed; as I mentioned in my call, that we, in the month of April, we have paid down in one month only $35 million of debt. So we had a little bit of a higher increase in the working capital in Q1; that impacted our cash flow slightly, but it was reversed in Q2. As I mentioned in April, we had a strong cash flow generation, leading to the debt reduction of $35 million.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer and Company: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Evanson with Dougherty and Company.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty and Company: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. Let's see here. Steve, you mentioned that kind of mid-March, coming back from CONEXPO, things kind of started to weaken. Now, we are now well over halfway through April. Are you seeing things coming back in April? What are you seeing in April here on E&C?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me be real careful here, just because circumstances are still, I would say, volatile out there. Let's just say that there is nothing we have seen in April that has caused our level of discomfort to rise. Consider that a negative something or another, but negative to a negative. But effectively, I'm not going to declare that any kind of inflection point in April. But thus far in April, we've seen nothing that causes us to increase our level of concern. I'm not declaring any kind of comfort yet, but thus far in April, things are not going badly.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty and Company: Does that mean no change from the back half of March?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say, again, too short of a time period. Again, I think that March -- first of all I have a personal belief system; the Company is acting to a different belief system. My personal belief system is this Bear Stearns news rattled the markets, rattled buying behavior and changed buying behavior more or less instantly. Just to causing a sharp contraction until we kind of in the sense of a contractor or a company saying until we understand what's going on out there, let's hold back on buying. So I think there was a headline factor in there. That's my personal belief system. Again, as a Company, we're acting as though the conditions we saw at the end of March will continue throughout the year and we're building our cost structure around that.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty and Company: Raj, you talked about an FX impact to the top line, 3% or maybe a little more impact to growth. I'm assuming that had the most favorable impact to the E&C division. Is that correct?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Well, E&C is our most internationalized division, and ag to a certain extent because ag is becoming fairly international as well, with a lot of sales growth in ag as well. So I would say E&C and ag.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty and Company: Okay. And I'm going to try to slip in number three here. Usually, you talk about incremental margins. Not hearing that today. I'm assuming that they are weak. So if you could give us your thoughts on what did you calculate?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Jeff, I think you just missed it.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: The incremental margins I talked about was we drop 25% off our margins to the bottom line, so our incremental margins as a Company are very strong. Our operating margins improved by more than 100 basis points in this quarter.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty and Company: Okay.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: So the answer is 25%, Jeff.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty and Company: Great, thanks a lot, guys.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Friedland with Soleil.
Peter Friedland - Soleil: Hi, two questions. First, on the ag markets, you had phenomenal growth in Q1; and would you expect that level of growth to continue throughout the year, or was there something specific to Q1 that boosted the sales in the quarter?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: So I think, we're not going to call the growth rate for a particular segment for the year, but as I said in my script, we don't see any -- in terms of the general environment, there was nothing unique about the first quarter. What we're seeing here is a market for underlying basic reasons taking off; we're well positioned to take advantage of that. And so, we're looking forward for the foreseeable future to just call it a very robust agriculture business here.
Peter Friedland - Soleil: And then within the E&C segment, was there any product line or product area that fared better in the weaker economic environment, or was it across -- talking about the weakness in the US was there weakness across the board?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it was -- I wouldn't call out any particular product one versus the other. I think that the -- if you look, at back at what we've been saying now for a year, probably, since the first quarter last year, we saw comparative slowing in survey instruments first, and then later in the year, construction. So what we're seeing on survey instruments at this point in time, in the US and only in the US; international is a totally different story. In the US is what we're now comparing ourselves against was a baseline to last year that was already under pressure, so the year-to-year comparisons are actually getting easier in survey instruments. And, to the extent that we are showing some relative optimism for the second half of the year, when we get into the third and fourth quarters is, again, the baseline for construction is going to be -- or the comparison to the prior year is going to get easier for us in the second half of the year. We had exceptionally strong growth in construction last year. And so it's just a real tough benchmark that we're comparing ourselves against on the construction. So I would say survey and kind of for arithmetic reasons or the like, had a relatively easier time construction maybe had a tougher time. But construction just had a hugely difficult baseline to compare itself against to the prior year, and that starts to return to kind of more of a steady state in the third quarter.
Peter Friedland - Soleil: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajit Pai with Thomas Weisel Partners
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Good afternoon. Quick question about the M&A environment, when you're looking -- you have been very acquisitive in the past and usually it's been relatively small sort of technology-based acquisitions and then you've made a couple of fairly large ones. Given the current environment right now, is your pipeline of acquisitions getting richer or are the things that you see that opportunistically as things slow, or get volatile that would like to be belonging to a company like Trimble and fits in with your portfolio? And also the lending environment for you, are you seeing any of your lenders raising the cost of capital for you folks in case you need to access the credit?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll let Raj answer the second question. In terms of the M&A question, I think overall, I would like to be evasive and relatively opaque on the issue. I really don't want to comment on what may or may not be happening on the M&A front. Other than to confirm is that we expect our traditional style of M&A to be continued into the future, generally comparatively small to medium-sized acquisitions that fill in strategic needs either to establish a market beachhead or to fill a product or a technology gap, when it turns out to be more cost-effective or more timely to acquire as opposed to do it inside. So, I'm just going to be deflecting the whole question onto Raj relative to the lending question.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So we have a revolving line of credit that we can draw on immediately up to $300 million and can expand it to $400 million. And that line is very solid and continues to be in place. The lending rates are basically based off LIBOR and it's 50 basis points to 75 basis points higher depending upon our EBITDA at that point of time. So, yeah, we have a very good solid line of credit and interest rates are very favorable on that line of credit.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Right, and then just looking at the receivables, was there any pattern that you observed in the quality of your receivables over the quarter?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: No. The aging continues to be excellent on these receivables. In Q2, if you look at the last five years, Q1 receivables go up versus Q4 of the prior year because agriculture and construction tends to be a March phenomenon. A lot of sales come out in March, so if you look at -- so that seasonality played out. We went from we increased it by two days. And if you look at last year same time, there was also an increase of three days from Q4 of 2006 to Q1 of 2007.
Ajit Pai - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.
Mark Strauss - JPMorgan: Hi, it's actually Mark Strauss on behalf of Paul. Just one quick question within Mobile Resource Management, are you still running two data centers supporting that?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: We are. We are running multiple data centers, that's when I talk to the synergies between Trimble and @Road, we still have further work to do there, and that's in the planning stages at this point. So, the answer is yes.
Mark Strauss - JPMorgan: Okay. That's all we have. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Spinola with Needham.
Andrew Spinola - Needham and Company: Thanks. A question about the TFS operating margin, is it safe to assume that the 40% in the first quarter is basically because you are running very hot right now, maybe you have to make some investments in that business that might weigh on the margins going forward? And sort of maybe if that assumption is correct, do you have a sense of what a more normalized operating margin is in that business, is it 2007? Any color you can give on that.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Maybe Raj can talk in some details, but let me just say, let me caution you on making judgments based on any given quarter in that business because it is a highly seasonal business. So, that margin will flop around a little bit over the course of the year just for nothing other than seasonal factors. But Raj, do you have anything else to add?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. What I would tell you is, yes, the margins will fluctuate based on seasonality. But as a whole, we model the Company to generate around 20 to 25% of incremental revenue falls to the bottom line. So, you'll see margins fluctuating around by segment and business units. But what you'll see consistently and you have seen in the last four or five years is, every quarter we have dropped on an average of 25% of incremental revenue to the bottom line. And we continue to plan to do that this year as well.
Andrew Spinola - Needham and Company: Got it. And just one other question on the Advanced Devices in the quarter, the revenue was a little weak, was that a one-quarter issue? Was that expected to rebound? Can you just provide some color there? Thanks.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So Advanced Devices is largely our components business. And there, it's a business that is typically characterized by unit volumes go up and average selling prices because of the competitive nature of that market tend to come down, so it's generally hard to, at least historically hard to get a lot of revenue growth out there. So I think that, let's just say in terms of the annual guidance, in terms of our actual strategic view, we're not looking for huge amounts of revenue growth out of the Advanced Devices segment. So I would say is, I'm not predicting a major shift for the rest of the year. I would say is it will tend to bounce around a little bit just because of the nature of the market. But again, I'm not putting high growth expectations at all on that business. We're managing it conservatively for cash and earnings, but not looking at, at least at this point in time for significant revenue growth out of it.
Andrew Spinola - Needham and Company: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan Securities.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: A couple of questions. First, on the E&C, I think you mentioned last quarter [multiple speakers]
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Can you hear me?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we can hear you.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: I think last quarter you mentioned in the E&C that it was domestically flat on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk about what it was in Q1 and maybe what you're looking for the rest of the year? It sounds like at least the back half of the year, the comps have become easier domestically.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, again, we're not going to talk to guidance by individual segment. I would characterize -- I would characterize the first quarter as a down quarter for us compared to the prior year in E&C in the U.S. And how much of that is what I would call underlying recession and how much of that is what I would call this headline factor I guess we'll have to sort out. But it was a down quarter for us in the quarter.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: You talked a lot about cutting back some costs in the E&C segment, but you're also pursuing the international opportunities, which there is growth. Can you discuss where you're seeing some international markets that are growing that you haven't yet penetrated well in both the E&C and Agriculture? And can you actually redeploy internal resources toward those markets or was it just cutting back in some areas and hiring in other areas?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so, I mean I think we are in a sense redeploying resources all the time. So, you've seen us over the last couple of years do things like open offices in Bangkok. You've seen us add a software development center, a service center, and well a factory in China. And so, increasingly, we are shifting the mix of resources to take advantage of the international, or at least the growth in resources are heavily being weighted towards the international realm at this point in time. So I think -- I might not be terribly precise on this -- but I think right now, the headcount of the Company is now 40% or more international. And with the @Road acquisition, for example, we now have a software development center in India. So, I think building physical presence assists the marketing effort. So, I think we're committed to investing internationally as rapidly as we can work and as prudently as we can. So, I think that net-net, I'm talking about cutting back but we're cutting back let's call it on a selective basis, and business by business, we're making judgments. But we're not backing off at all from the areas that need investment. And so we are -- what we're doing is tweaking ourselves back into the model that we think is sustainable for E&C.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: And I wanted to just clarify my question -- a part of my question. You mentioned in Agriculture Field Solutions, you're seeing some opportunities now in Europe beyond Brazil, Australia and U.S. Can you talk about in E&C where you are not yet pursuing opportunities where there is good construction infrastructure build out?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Okay, so I mean in terms of penetration international, so in my script, I talked to the fact that Survey Instruments is really the only business that kind of at this moment is affecting an international profile that we're targeting and they still have work to do themselves. But I would say in terms of construction and agriculture, in terms of unpenetrated markets, where there is still significant potential internationally. For Agriculture, pick anyplace outside of Brazil, outside of Australia and outside of North America and that, in my view, is still very much unpenetrated territory. And, in terms of Construction, I would start with Eastern Europe and then it gets to be pretty much everywhere outside of North America, Japan and Europe is what I would call largely unpenetrated territory for Construction. So, I think there is a colossal upside for us over the next few years as a Company if we can execute.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay. Great, that's helpful.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Blanton with Ingalls & Snyder.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Hi, good afternoon. I had to get off for a minute so you might have covered this. But, you mentioned early on that the market is only 30% penetrated. And could you elaborate on that? What market are you really talking about here? What do you mean by 30% penetrated?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so the specific comment was relating to agriculture. So, on a worldwide basis we believe Agriculture, in spite of horrendous growth over the last couple of years, we still believe we are less than 30% penetrated worldwide. So, the comment was specific to Agriculture.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Oh, just to the AG market?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And how -- have you looked ahead to say how much time will go by before its fairly fully penetrated or are we talking five years, 10 years, or what are the parameters?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm not sure we have that level of precision. And again, we're surprising ourselves by how intensely productive the agriculture market is at this point in time for us. But I would say is that for the next five years, for Agriculture or Construction, for the high-end survey instruments we sell, I don't think for virtually any market Trimble is in, is that the word saturation or product replacement cycles is going to be part of our vocabulary for at least five years, pretty much across the board.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And this agriculture market is becoming global now, it's not --
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So, until really almost now, it has been a market that has been focused in North America, U.S. and Canada, Brazil and Australia. It just those three regions accounted -- two countries and one region accounted for a vast percentage of the agriculture sales. What we're announcing is Europe growing at a very, very fast rate. We're seeing other areas of the world growing. And we've begun -- we actually believe China is a market for us and so we've begun to deploy resources in China. So, it's not a manner -- the China question is, okay, you're saving labor? Well, what we're not saving is labor. What we're enabling is a lower use of input costs, fuel and fertilizer, which are becoming very expensive; and, therefore, what we're seeing is a whole new economics coming into play that were not available in -- well, just last year, even. So, what we're seeing is that smaller -- that our solution for agriculture is becoming economic for smaller and smaller farms just because of the increased natural gas, which drives fertilizer costs and the increased fuel costs; we're able to add enough productivity for smaller farms that essentially our market has grown even in places like the U.S. in the last year, just because of the increase in fuel and fertilizer costs.
Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Berglund.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, that's it. I appreciate your attending and talk to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Lea Ann McNabb - Investor Relations: Thank you for joining Trimble's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2007 Earnings Call. I am here with Steve Berglund, our President and CEO and with Rajat Bahri, our CFO. Before we begin the call, let me remind you that during the course of this call we will make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. The words intend, expects, plan or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially. Important factors relating to our business including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are disclosed in our Forms 10-Q, 10-K and other filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in assumptions or other factors. With that I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon. The quarter ending in December represented the end of a strong year for Trimble. Revenues were up 30% year-to-year and were over $1 billion for the first time. The second half of the year was as strong as the first half with both being up 30% demonstrating that US recession concerns did not have a material negative effect on Trimble revenue growth in the second half. Non-GAAP operating income continued to grow at a rate faster than revenues and grew by 45% for the total year. Operating leverage for the full year was 26% and the full non-GAAP operating margin grew to 19.4% despite the drag effect from @Road. During the year, we also made significant progress in developing our major strategic themes in the Connected Construction Site, Precision Agriculture, and especially in Mobile Resource Management where we significantly increased our market presence with the @Road acquisition. In last quarter's conference call we characterized Trimble's current environment and give our best judgment on the outlook for both the fourth quarter and into 2008.At this point, we are reaffirming that picture based on our best updated judgment of current circumstances. We of course need to respect the higher degree of uncertainty in the financial markets and increasing concerns for a slower US economy. At the same time, we are basing our outlook on what we can currently see and on what we believe we can do to mitigate the US economic conditions. In October we commented on what we saw as continuing slowness in the US Engineering and Construction market and the relative volatility we saw during the third quarter in that segment in the US. As expected, the US market for E&C continued to be slower than the prior year during the fourth quarter. While we continue to monitor the construction market for additional changes, our basic outlook for 2008 remains the same as it was in October and assumes the US economy is slower, but does not dramatically worsen. Of particular importance is how quickly the financial markets move through the subprime-related problems and enable the credit markets to resume providing liquidity to our US users. In the third quarter call, we made the additional observation that international revenues were continuing to be strong in the Engineering and Construction segment, and we are offsetting slower US conditions. During the fourth quarter, our international revenues continued to be very strong with no signs at this point of slowing down. A significant portion of management effort in 2008 will be devoted towards intensifying our efforts to grow our international presence across all our segments. Another observation we made in October was that we did not intend to wait out the slower conditions in the US Engineering and Construction segment and that we will take proactive actions to mitigate the slower US construction market. This belief has formulated around our view of the characteristics of our US E&C market. One characteristic is that during tougher times the better run and better capitalized surveying and construction firms will use these tougher times as an opportunity to improve their market position, using the productivity achieved through technology as a competitive edge. We expect this group of users to continue buying whatever the conditions and we need to make sure we are there when we make that decision. In addition, we believe there are market segments such as the Heavy and Highway or Cadastral segments which will retail a relatively healthy spending rate regardless of the macro economy. We need to ensure our distribution channel is appropriately focused on these comparatively healthy segments. Based on this view of the market, we stated in the October call that we believe that fourth quarter E&C results will demonstrate better year-over-year growth performance than the third quarter. In reality, that is what occurred as the E&C segment growth year-over-year was 17% in the fourth quarter compared to 12% in the third quarter. We also noted that our Field Solutions segment has seen strong performance throughout 2007 based primarily on exceptional performance from our agricultural business. Agricultural performance in the fourth quarter was again exceptional, both in the US and internationally, and the expectations is that we will continue to face a buoyant agricultural market throughout 2008. We also spoke to the continuing development of our Mobile Solutions segment post @Road acquisition. The fourth quarter represented a significant step forward in this segment with a year-over-year acquisition-assisted revenue increase of 181% and operating margins for the quarter 14.8%. While the segment margins reflected highly beneficial product mix, it did reflect both our progress as well as potential for this business. The combination of all of these factors contributed to a strong fourth quarter and a comparatively robust view of the first quarter and total 2008. The key question is how much of the 2007 success we can carry into 2008 against the backdrop of the uncertainty about the state of the US economy. The macro views on the effects of a US slowdown are relevant, but only partly relevant when applied to Trimble. Given that we have already embedded lower expectations for the US economy in our outlook, the key determinants of success for Trimble in 2008 are rebated to continued growth outside the US, driven most heavily by infrastructure projects on highways, runways, railways and pipelines and secondarily by reasonable general European growth; a continuing robust agricultural segment; our ability to execute our mobile resources management strategy and capture the growth available in that segment; and avoiding an economic dislocation in US that is significantly more severe than what is currently in evidence. Based on both what we can see at this time and what we can do, we continue to view 2008 with guarded optimism in spite of the current general backdrop of economic concerns. More importantly, our three-year view remains unguardedly buoyant based on our views of how our strategy will play out in markets that have significant penetration potential still remaining. Finally, I will leave to it Raj to explain the details of our announced stock buyback program. Let me emphasize that our priority remains to invest in the strategic development of our businesses. However, our businesses do not require substantial capital expenditures and require relatively modest investments in working capital. In addition, we do not see any major internal programs in the next few years that would require a change in our historical business model relative to cash investments. Although we intend to continue to make strategic acquisitions, we believe that we will conform to our historical pattern of being relatively small and focused. Based on these considerations, we believe the cash flow we currently expect to generate from operations in the medium term will generate cash in excess of the investment needs of the business. As a result, the Board of Directors authorized a stock buyback plan to enable any excess cash to be used to benefit shareholders. Let me turn call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Good afternoon. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $312.8 million, up approximately 34% from revenue of $234.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fiscal 2007 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 30% when compared to fiscal 2006 revenue of $940.2 million. Excluding the acquisition of @Road, revenue grew by approximately 20% both for the quarter and full year versus prior year. Turing to operating income, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $39.3 million, up 44% from the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2007 were 12.6% compared to 11.7% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Please be aware that for year-over-year comparisons, amortization of intangibles increased from $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Stock based compensation expenses... expense was $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. And there was no in-process research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 while there was a $860,000 in-process research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2006. If you exclude these impacts, non-GAAP operating income of $53.4 million grew by 51% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 and non-GAAP operating margins were 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007, up from 15.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006, an expansion of 200 basis points. For the full year 2007, operating income was $178.3 million, up 32% compared to 2006. Fiscal 2007 operating margins were 14.6% compared to 14.4% in 2006. Again it should be noted that amortization of intangibles increased from $13.1 million in 2006 to $38.6 million in 2007 due to acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense was $15 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. In-process research and development expense was $2.1 million in 2007 compared to $1.9 million in 2006. There was a $3 million restructuring expense in 2007 while in 2006 there was no restructuring. If you exclude these impacts, 2007 non-GAAP operating income of $237 million grew by 45% compared to 2006 and non-GAAP operating margin increased from 17.3% in 2006 to 19.4% in 2007. Our 2007 non GAAP operating leverage was 26%, which means we dropped 26% of incremental revenue to operating income, which led to margin expansion. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was up approximately 10% to $26.3 million compared the net income of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $0.21, up from diluted earnings per share of $0.20 in the fourth quarter of 2006. The tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 35%, up from 25% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Adjusting for the amortization of intangibles, in-process research and development, and the impact of stock-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was up 18% to $35.5 million compared to non-GAAP net income of $30.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $0.28, up from non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net income for fiscal 2007 was up approximately 13% to $117.4 million compared to net income of $103.7 million in 2006. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 were $0.94, up from diluted earnings per share of $0.89 in 2006. The full year tax rate for 2007 was 36% compared to 30% in 2006. Adjusting restructuring charges, the amortization of intangibles, in-process research and development, and the impact of stock-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2007 was up 26% to $155.1 million compared to non-GAAP net income of $123.2 million in fiscal 2006. Non-GAAP earnings per share for 2007 was $1.25, up approximately 17% from 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.06. When we look at revenue mix by geography, as we saw throughout 2007, fourth quarter revenue growth was very strong internationally. 52% of revenue comes again from North America, 29% from Europe, 13% from Asia-Pacific, and 6% from rest of the world. This represents a 23% increase in North America, 52% increase in Europe, 24% increase in Asia-Pacific and 92% increase in rest of the world. For the full year, 56% of revenue came from North America, 27% from Europe, 12% from Asia-Pacific, and 5% from rest of the world. This represents a 22% increase in North America, 41% increase in Europe, 30% increase in Asia-Pacific and 87% increase in rest of the world. Let me now discuss the results by segments, both on an underlying basis and reported basis. Please note that segments operating income is revenue less cost of goods sold and operating expenses, excluding general corporate expenses, amortization of intangible and in-process resource and development. In addition for each segment, non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Fourth quarter 2007 Engineering and Constructions revenue was $186.7 million, up approximately 17% when compared to revenue of $160 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter, E&C saw growth in all businesses within the segment and a strong international market. Fourth quarter 2007 operating income in E&C was $36.8 million or 19.7% of revenue compared to $32.6 million or 20.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $37.9 million or 20.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $33.6 million or 21% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating margins were slightly down due to product mix and acquisitions impact. Fiscal 2007 E&C revenue was $743.3 million, up approximately 17% when compared to revenue of $637.1 million in 2006, driven by all businesses segments. Operating income in E&C was $174.2 million for 2007 or 23.4% of revenue compared to $136.2 million or 21.4% of revenue in 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $177.8 million or 23.9% of revenue in 2007, compared to $140.1 million or 22% of revenue in 2006. The strong operating margin expansion came from gross margins, due to increased products software content and operating expense leverage. Fourth quarter 2007 Field Solutions revenue was $49.6 million, up approximately 62% when compared to revenue of $30.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter, sales of agricultural products continue to be robust, driven by a strong global market and success of our products. Fourth quarter 2007 operating income in TFS was $14 million or 28.2% of revenue compared to $6.5 million or 21.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in TFS was $14.2 million or 28.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $6.8 million or 22.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fiscal 2007 TFS revenue was $200.6 million, up approximately 44%, when compared to revenue of $139.2 million in 2006. Operating income in TFS was $60.9 million for 2007 or 30.4% of revenue, compared to $37.4 million or 26.8% of revenue in 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in TFS was $61.7 million or 30.8% of revenue in 2007, compared to $38.4 million or 27.5% of revenue in 2006. Margin expansion was driven by strong revenue growth. As a reminder, year-over-year comparisons for Mobile Solutions results excluded the acquisition of @Road in 2006. The acquisition was completed in February of 2007. Fourth quarter 2007 Mobile Solutions revenue was $47.7 million, up approximately 181% when compared to revenue of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter, of the @Road acquisition completed in February of 2007 continue to exceed expectations in terms of financial performance. Fourth quarter 2007 operating income in TMS was $5.7 million or 12% of revenue, compared to $828,000 or 4.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in TMS was $7 million or 14.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $1.1 million or 6.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Both revenue and margin benefited from successful completion of significant deliverables for two major @Road customers. This was partially offset by weakness in the direct store delivery business. Fiscal 2007, TMS revenue was $157.7 million, up approximately 159%, when compared to revenue of $60.9 million in 2006. Operating income in TMS was $12.5 million for 2007 or 7.9% of revenue compared to $2.6 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in TMS was $17.5 million or 11.1% of revenue in 2007, compared to $3.3 million or 5.4% of revenue in 2006. The margin expansion was driven by a higher subscription base. Moving on to Advanced Devices, fourth quarter 2007 Advanced Devices revenue was $28.8 million, up approximately 8% when compared to a revenue of $26.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter, sales of Applanix products were strong, while there was some softness in embedded product sales. Fourth quarter 2007 operating income in Advanced Devices was $3.7 million or 12.7% of revenue, compared to $1.4 million or 5.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $4 million or 14% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $1.8 million or 6.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fiscal 2007 Advanced Devices revenue was $120.7 million, up approximately 17%, when compared to revenue of $102.9 million in 2006. Operating income in Advanced Devices was $17.3 million for 2007 or 14.3% of revenue, compared to $10.1 million or 9.8% of revenue in 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $18.6 million or 15.4% of revenue in 2007, compared to $11.9 million or 11.6% of revenue in 2006. Margin expansion was driven by the full year impact of licensing revenue from Nokia and mix of products. For the overall company, gross margins for the fourth quarter of 2007 were 49.8% and excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation; non-GAAP gross margins were 51.6%. This compares to gross margin of 49.4% and non-GAAP gross margins of 50.4% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Gross margins for 2007 were 50.1% and excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margins were 51.9%. This compares to gross margins of 49% and non-GAAP gross margins of 49.7% in 2006. Gross margins expanded both on the quarterly and yearly basis, due to new products, increased software sales and higher subscription revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 came in at $108.1 million or 34.6% of revenue, compared to 35.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2007 came in at $397.3 million or 32.5% of revenue compared to 32.4% of revenue in 2006. Non-operating income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.3 million versus $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The reduction was driven by higher interest expense and loss on foreign exchange transactions. Non-operating income for the full year 2007 was $5.5 million versus $12.7 million in 2006. The reduction was driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by increased joint venture profitability. Looking now at the balance sheet, we finished the fourth quarter of 2007 with $103.2 million in cash compared to $84.1 million in the prior quarter. Our debt levels, primarily from the @Road acquisition is $60.7 million, down from $81.1 million in the third quarter of 2007. The strong cash flow from operations resulted in reduction of debt and increased in cash balances. For the full year 2007, we generated $187 million of cash from operations, an increase of 38% over 2006. In the fourth quarter, net accounts receivables were $239.9 million compared to $242.6 million in the third quarter of 2007. More importantly, days sales outstanding declined to 70 days from 75 days in the prior quarter. The reduction was driven by a more linear quarter and better collections. All though days sales outstanding declined significantly versus prior quarter, we have seen a shift in our business to international this year. Internationally, the payment terms tend to be higher than the U.S. business. This change in mix causes an increase in our day of sales outstanding. Inventory was $143 million compared to $142.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. The turns were flat at 4.3 times. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our deferred revenue balance was $65.3 million, which was relatively flat compared to $65.6 million in the third quarter of 2007. Our deferred revenue balance was up 133% year-over-year from $28.1 million to $65.3 million. I will now talk about the guidance for 2008. In the first quarter of 2008, Trimble expects revenue to grow 17% to 19% compared to first quarter of 2007 with revenue between $334 million and $339 million. Trimble expects first quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share between $0.26 and $0.28 and non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.33 and $0.35. Non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of 2008 excludes the amortization of intangibles of $10.2 million related to previous acquisitions and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expenses of $3.7 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance use a 38% tax rate, compared to an actual 32% tax rate in the first quarter of 2007, and assume 127 million shares outstanding. For the full year of 2008, Trimble expects revenue to grow 14% to 17% compared to fiscal 2007, with revenue between $1.39 billion and $1.43 billion. Trimble expects 2008 non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.39 and $1.44. This assumes a non-GAAP margin expansion of 100 basis points in 2008, a tax rate of 38% and 129 million shares outstanding. Non-GAAP guidance for the full year excludes the amortization of intangibles of $41.2 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $14.7 million. Including these impacts, Trimble expects 2008 GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.12 and $1.17. Last week, we also note that our Board has approved a stock buyback program of $250 million effective February 1st. Our first priority continues to be, invest our cash in the business through internal development or value enhancing strategic acquisitions. However, based on the current multi-year outlook, we believe we will generate cash in excess of those needs and returning that excess cash to our shareholders through a buyback program is the most effective mechanism to enhance shareholder value. Thank you and we will now take questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Amit Kapur with Piper Jaffray.
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Hey, thanks a lot for taking my question. In terms of the E&C business, could you guys maybe update us in terms of the competitive environment and how you see the market share trending in 2008?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think I prefer to characterize where it is, and where isn't in 2007 and would characterize the trend as likely to continue into 2008. I think that the competitive environment for E&C remains largely the same as it has for a number of years. There are three principal players currently operating in that space, us with the number one share, Topcon and Leica which is now owned by Hexagon, and the three of us basically are the three principal players in that marketplace. I would describe our position as I would have for a number of years as being at the number one. If you look at our... if you look at the breakdown regionally, I believe we are doing comparatively better than the other players in the U.S. I believe we have taken significant market share in Europe recently and across the world, the picture isn't quite as clear, but I would say is that we are expanding aggressively internationally and we are seeing strong growth internationally. So, I would suspect, but really couldn't prove very comprehensively that we are taking share internationally. So I would say structurally, the market stays very much the same as it has for a number of years, I would say, as our net position is improving.
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. And maybe a quick question on your guidance and Q1 looks like year-on-year, you are looking for revenue growth of 17% to 19% and then for the full year, 14% to 17%. So that implies maybe a little bit of a deceleration later in the year. Is that just caution with some of the macro economic volatility we are seeing out there or there are other factors at play?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think that as always as we try to be sober and a bit cautious as a company I think we are still largely a book and burn business. So we don't have great visibility out into the second half of the year. So I think we're being very respectful of the commentary out there. And are talking about a number we believe is consistent with our internal view and I think we'll see what comes in the second half of the year. But again, I believe that we have established based on what we can see at this point of time is sober. Our sober view of the total year and again I think that we'll have to wait and see what comes in the second half of the year end to see if there is any volumes beyond these numbers.
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Sure, that's fair enough. Maybe one final question, in terms of the strong agricultural margins you reported, is that simply a matter of the strength in Ag offsetting some of the seasonality or is there something little bit more structural there?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say is... I wouldn't attribute any of it to any kind of structural changes within the agricultural business. Certainly as we grow revenues at a rapid rate, we're getting some scale advantage certainly. But pricing is not a factor, not the question you ask but a related question I guess is that pricing is comparatively steady. We are acting as a pricing leader at the low end of the market, not characteristic of Trimble. But we believe we have a cost position at the low end products in agriculture, the market has proven to be very elastic. So we are using our cost position to advantage there and our leading the way on pricing there, but otherwise there's really nothing structural from the cost end point or pricing standpoint, that's going on in agriculture.
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Great, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Benett Notman with Davenport & Co.
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Could you just give a little more detail on the two deliverables that benefited the Mobile Solutions in the quarter and sort of if we should expect then some sort of drop off in the coming quarters and those who are behind us. That would be the first question. And then secondly, can you just talk about Mobile Solutions in general. I mean, we haven't seen any sort of large lead announcements or any of the type of things that we used to see from @Road since they came within Trimble, so I am just trying to get a feel for sort of how that business is progressing versus your milestones.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so I would say is that there were some what I would call... as we talked about for a number of quarters now is that, that business in particular and as result Trimble overall has become bit lumpier in terms of the revenues that reports from quarter-to-quarter and the fact that there is a need to kind of look at, if you will, rolling performance to get a real ideas for the trends in the company. So I would necessarily call it a drop off coming in the next couple of quarters because there is pipeline behind those items. I wouldn't necessarily say that... I would say that there were some one-time effects in the fourth quarter that may or may not be repeated in the first quarter or the second quarter, but again I would say is, it's part of an overall flow. As far as not announcing wins, I think what you're saying here is a bit of a contrast in corporate styles. It is not our style necessarily to go out with press releases on every win, we tend to be a bit more conservative that. So again, as we've been... since we entered this business in 2001, we've been saying watch the financials, don't necessarily watch the press releases and we're going to hold ourselves accountable to improving financial performance. Implicitly, asking the implicit question, have there been wins? Yes, there have been wins, have some of them been large, yes, but we haven't chosen to announce what they are.
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company LLC: Okay. And then just sort of clarifying a little on the first part, should we expect sequential growth from Mobile Solutions over the next couple of quarters or with the one-time items that happened, a significant enough that it's very challenging to grow off the most recent quarter of trend?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again we don't give guidance by segment, and so I think I've said about as much as we mean to say at this point of time. But again, I would say, is over a period you will see a trend. The trend is upwards and we are kind to go on record in past quarter, as to what we expect out of that business.
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company LLC: All right, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Thank you, good afternoon. A sort of follow-up on engineering and construction. In two prior quarters, now you've had two separate issues. In one case, it was sort of regional softness and another it was an attempt to try and get the surveying segment of the market to stop buying your equipment. Can you just comment on those two aspects of engineering and construction?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think by and large, they've been the same this year. I would tend to look at them, the issue as surveying issues, we're throughout 2007, we're focused in the U.S. We have had outstanding growth outside of the U.S. But through out the year 2007, we have seen a bit of a struggle relative to the 2006 comparison. So I would say is that the market... overall market conditions, the background of the market conditions did not approve... did not improve in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. But I would say is that further surveying is... surveying business really much the same in the fourth quarter in terms of the general market conditions in the U.S. And what I would say is that a lot of that comparison has been against 2006. So the relative struggle we've had throughout 2007 both for surveying instruments and for E&C in total, as we have been comparing ourselves against a spectacularly probably historically unprecedented 2006, which was exceptionally strong in the U.S. followed by a 2007 where market conditions changed. The part of the calculation going into 2008 as we now comparing ourselves year-to-year against the 2007 and frankly, the baseline becomes a bit easier. So I would say is that in reality, nothing in terms of the general market changed all that much in the fourth quarter. We are in the U.S. for surveying or for E&C in general, is not as robust certainly as it was in 2006. But again, we've taken a number of actions in terms of focusing distribution, in terms of our relative corporate focus to count our after market and our basic premises that in hard times productivity is still... productivity may actually be of more value than good times and therefore best of premise we are taking to the market place and we are not going to sit out the slowness in the U.S. We intend to come back... continue to come back with options for the marketplace and sell through this.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Got it. And this can be some cap... many believe there might be capital rationing or actually especially associated with sort of housing starts businesses and possibly with some commercial real estate. Are you in a position to parameterize the business in North America... the economically sensitive business as a percentage of your overall and E&C business, can you even guess of that?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I am not, can you repeat that question, I guess --
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: I guess what I am trying to get to Steve is, we are trying to figure out how much of your E&C business domestically is exposed to the most, sort of economically vulnerable cost of engineering, construction and housing starts and all those related to that obviously the most?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Well, as we kind of pointed out repeatedly over time is that our relative priority in E&C in terms of the businesses that are most important for us in E&C, the dynamic allotments are in E&C are heavy and highway, which tends to be ultimately driven by government spending, both federal and state level, followed by large scale commercial, followed by smaller scale commercial, the strip malls and such and finally housing and effectively, probably in the third quarter of 2005 we took our crumble in related to housing and that's been internalized now for over a year, so housing starts are not a primary concern for us in terms of looking at this business. And just, back to this establishing the baseline, the thing is that our housing related products actually in the latter part of '07 were actually comparatively robust against 2006 as back to the sell through pieces is that, I think the slide stocks related to housing, again a fourth order business for us, at some point in mid 2007 and we are actually seeing comparative, underlying comparative strength there. But again, heavy and highway, large scale commercial, small scale commercial and then housing are the relative sequence of markets that are most important to us.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: That's helpful, thank you. And then lastly, outside of the U.S. E&C once again, are there any catalysts, regulations, any countries that you think you could highlight to us that are experiencing exceptional growth at the moment and you feel that there is very strong momentum and we should be monitoring those nations or regulations or events?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes frankly for 2007, I think you can almost take a... put on a blindfold and throw a dart at a globe and probably hit a market that's competitively strong. So, at this point in time, if you can scan the world, so China still strong, India from a low base is very strong, Middle East is in some respects red hot, South Africa hot, but then we are seeing significant potential from a relatively small base, but we are seeing significant potential, lots of activity in Africa outside of South Africa as development money is moving into there, they're building infrastructure. They are putting a whole lot of emphasis on establishing what property boundaries are in such, entering a lot of fundamental effort, developments in terms of surveying. Russia is strong, Eastern Europe is very strong and Western Europe has been a good market for us for '07. So, at the moment maybe with the possible exclusion of some countries in Latin America, what we are seeing is growth pretty much everywhere outside the U.S.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: All right.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Including Canada very emphatically.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: There are no events or regulations that we should be aware of that might change things positively or negatively?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Not that I am aware of, so if you discover any, please let me know.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions from me; first, again on E&C. You mentioned during the last call that the quarter began very strongly. I was just wondering if you can give us any sense of linearity and kind of what you've been hearing from your customers in the last couple of months and if you have taken their pulse of late, what are you feeling?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Right. So, again in the October call, which was probably a little shorter than the third, all the way through the quarter as we expressed a certain amount of optimism about the quarter and I think as you can see that the entire quarter continued to represent that optimism. So there were no linear effects. We spoke to linear effects in the third quarter in terms of July and August having different behavior than September; I would not characterize the fourth quarter in anyway in that fashion. Okay, in terms of kind of up-to-date, the customer's sentiment, I think what I would point to is last week, there was the World of Concrete, which is a trade show aimed at certain classes of contractors. We participated in that show, and frankly, our people came away from that show very optimistic, very buoyant in terms of it's a show that we sell off of and frankly our sales after that show, I am not totally current in terms of just where we ended up, but we believe that we either equaled or probably exceeded last year and certainly ... which was a record. So there is a bit of a paradox here in terms of just what is going on in terms of the construction economy. So, you wouldn't... if I have taken my cue from Long Street I would have expected a lot of negatives and doom and gloom at that trade show, but in reality what we saw was a lot of comparative optimism or expectations of growth. So one data point, but I think may be it's representative is that it's not all way in this economy, but there are if you will, paradoxes but it is not all doom gloom out there.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Fair enough, optimism on time Las Vegas as we all know. One more question --
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: That depends on whether you are a winner or loser, doesn't it?
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Indeed, indeed. One more question, in terms of the Mobile Solutions business, what's your feeling about the economic sensitivity of that part of your business and is that something that you think that continues to grow even if we do get some economic macro headwinds next year, or rather this year?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well again I'll have to... and all into actual honesty say, it's a relatively new game for us. So, unlike construction, unlike surveying, unlike agriculture, I can't point back to our experience in 2001 and 2002 to give us any pointers in terms what happens, when. Now I will give you my believe system though relative to that market and again, with the idea that... okay, if you look at the customers base there, okay, there are some big players that have significant balance sheets, who are absolutely driven at this point of time by the concept of improving operations and really see the management of the mobile worker, the mobile asset as being absolutely key to their transformation programs. And this is again an international phenomenon. So I think that first of all, let's call it, the large scale customers, they have balance sheet. They will be if there are harder times, they would be even more driven to drive cost out of their operation and using technology as a way to do it is I think the comparatively small investment against the greater scheme of things. And I think that there, I wouldn't expect hard times necessary to push back and again the level of capital investment here to buy our stock is not huge. The ROIs are comparatively in relative terms instantaneous, so I think that we still stay at the high end of priority list even during harder time. Then I suppose there is a middle class or a lower level here of something more moderate sized companies. It's a fair question in terms of if there is a push back from the economy, what will happen? But I would argue that the same thinking takes place, which is we can go and the paper and pencil demonstrate an ROI. We can replace few well other costs with our technology, we can actually demonstrate, we can take cost out during hard times and so again, I think that if we were talking of high ticket item, if we were selling a high ticket item that I would say, yes. When we start to allocate capital, we might take a hit. But again, looking at the level of investment required to put in what we were selling in the equipments of the return on that, I would say that we can sell through that. Again we will have to wait for objective evidence, if and when we do encounter that slowdown you are referring to. The other thing just again answering a question you didn't ask, which is I think one of the things for our Mobile Solutions segment in '08 is that that's far for both @Road side and the Trimble Mobil Solutions side is we... this has been largely a U.S centric business until recently. We are taking this business international in an aggressive fashion. Just in the last few months, we've done a number of things. So to the extend that you buy into the thesis, but there is a whole lot of investment going on internationally that there is a whole lot of infrastructure development. During '08, not talking about '09, but talking about '08, there should be a noticeable effect on the results of our Mobile Solution segment there as well.
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Thank you. I will get back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from Corey Tobin with William Blair & Company.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Good afternoon, congrats on nice quarter. A couple of things I want to hear, let's start with the E&C growth. Steve, in your remarks you mentioned that the E&C growth was domestically lower Q4 versus Q3. I wanted to just check to see if I heard that correctly? And also is there any way we can... I know you don't want to give growth by segment or by geographic region, but is there any way that we could get a feel for the order of magnitude in terms of how large that trend was?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: So I think you got it backwards is that fourth in E&C in the third quarter the growth was year-to-year was 12%, in the fourth quarter it was 17%. So we had projected that in October that we would see a bounce in E&C in the fourth quarter from third quarter. So actually year-over-year growth in E&C accelerated in the fourth quarter over that we saw in third quarter. Now again, it's a mix of international, U.S., it's a mix of different product areas but we don't give guidance by segment, but obviously, we continued to in an overall sense view E&C as being a growth business. We believe E&C will be a growth business in '08 and will contribute a large part of that 14% to 17% revenue growth in '08. So, yes, the U.S. is a slower market than it was in '06. It will continue to be in our view slower throughout 2008. We are counteracting that in U.S. as much as we can, but we also see the international picking up the pace. So, kind of what you see in the second half of '07 is right now kind of what we are expecting for '08 for E&C.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: I am sorry, may be I didn't ask the question correctly, I was referring to growth in E&C in the domestic market in the U.S. Was growth in the U.S. down in the fourth quarter, or lower growth rate in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? I thought in your prepared comments, you mentioned that or probably later on.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Steve, no, that means Steve actually mentioned that our growth rate went from 12% in Q3 to 17% and the growth rates was higher in both domestic as well as international to come to that 17%. Not slower in the U.S. in Q4 versus Q3.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Okay, understood, thank you. And then finally, on the same topic rather, the number you have assumed for 2008 in the U.S. is consistent with what we saw in the second half of this year, is that, did I hear it correctly?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I am not being that specific, but I am saying again is that, I think that we believe that we... is that what that we've internalized a lot of what's going on or most of all of what's going on in the U.S at this moment in time, we internalize that in the second half of the year. So unless things significantly worsen through the U.S., which is always possible but not yet evident, I am just suggesting as a guideline is that what you do is take the second half of E&C, year-over-year and project that forward. That's kind of what we are doing and that's our internal expectation subject to some more data about what might happen out there.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Okay, great. Shifting to the profitability side, it looks like margins in the fourth quarter for E&C dipped a little bit year-over-year. Any comment on that, are there any particular drivers that might be worth calling out?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, a couple of things, so if you look at full year E&C margins, they were significantly up in the fiscal year. What we are comparing is the Q4 of '06 was extraordinary a rich quarter from a product mix point of view. So product mix accounted for a little bit in Q4 particularly and we had some acquisitions like Meridian and XYZ that are still a drag on the E&C businesses year-over-year. So those and a combination of those two things drove the margins for Q4, but as I said, it was just one quarter. If you look at the full year picture, it was still up and so that's the answer there.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: And adding to that again, asking at your question or answering a question you didn't asked. So structurally, the business in terms of margins nothing has happened structurally to that business. Pricing, pricing is on... was effectively unchanged in the fourth quarter to prior quarters, so nothing is going on there, nothing is going on from a cost point. So by and large it's called short term perturbations of year-to-year comparisons.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: And as we look ahead to next year for operating margin in this segment, should we continue to expect sort of your normal trend upward into 2008?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think that's the right way to look at it. In any given quarter, there might be again a perturbation because we are continuing to make some investments and in fact, we have stepped up our investment level in some cases. So in any given quarter, there might be a perturbation, but for the full year I would say that you continue to expect those are some margin improvements, particularly if some of these acquisitions start to contribute more to the party.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Great. And the last one if I could please, on the DSOs I understand the greater international mix impacting them a bit. Where would you say you would expect them to... have they stabilized at this level or would you expect them to continue to trend higher throughout '08, if you would expect international to grow in the fashion of domestic market? And what's a good target that we should be thinking about for the year?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: I mean this year we clearly have taken a step up because of the mix of international sales being higher. So it depends, next year if international continues to outpace the domestic growth, the U.S. growth then we would start... we still see just a mix of price will shift to international and hence the DSOs may start creeping up because of that. But no changes in the payment terms, just the mix of the business.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Okay, great. But there is no... any particular target that you are looking at, with respect to sort of where it could be a year from now?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we always try to balance it with better collections. So if the international business grows and the domestic... U.S. business is flat lined, you could potentially see a three four days increase because of that.
Corey Tobin - William Blair & Company: Understood, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Rath with Canaccord Adams.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Questions here, I was wondering if you could give me some color as to the impact acquisitions would have on your revenue growth guidance for 2008. And you've given us a range here... you don't typically do that, but can you give you some order of magnitude there?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: If you know, Jeff I will try to give you some color around it, but once we begin with acquisitions we kind of, what's acquisition and what's not acquisition get hard to measure because we do integrate technologies, we do integrate product, we use cost... use each others channels as well. So, that's why we kind of try to stay away from giving some magnitude around it. The only thing @Road was a unique one, we did quantify @Road because it was a big acquisition. Everything else is very small acquisitions, they are technology tuck-ins and they are baked into our growth rate, the guidance that we give. If you look at historically, over the last four or five years, they have probably contributed 2 to 3 points of growth. So if you look at last five years excluding @Road, we have grown around 20%, probably 2 to 3 points of that has been due to acquisitions, excluding @Road.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Okay. Looking again your segmented revenue breakdowns, you don't guide on that basis, is there any color you can maybe give us around your Field Solutions business, you came off a tremendous year here, 44% annual growth. Any way we should think about that, are we looking at a market in '08 that could sustain those growth rates or do you think that that has to come down just based on overall tougher comps next year? Any color around that would be helpful.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that... I guess there is a bit of it. Internally, we're waiting to see just how good it could it be in '08. Certainly, I don't think what we would be doing here would be saying you should bank, if it was 44% for the year, I don't think you should bank that because that... maintaining that kind of growth rate over a period of time is very difficult. So, I, again we don't give guidance at that level, but let's just say we're still banking on a very robust agriculture economy and which seems to be borne out by other players in the agricultural economy even having metal types. And so we're counting on let's just say, another excellent year with very strong double-digit growth that I'm not going to sign-up for another 44% a year if that's what it was.
Jeff Rath - Canaccord Adams: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Evanson with Dougherty and Company.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: You know when you guys make me wait this long to ask questions, I just come up with more.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Go ahead Jeff.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Yes, sorry.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Waiting for you.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Yes. So let's start with the guidance, I've got a couple of questions around that. If I figure out just kind of roughly what it's going to add to your Q1 growth to anniversary this @Road acquisition, it seems like that probably adds 5% to 7% to your annual, to your year-over-year growth rates. So that actually looks to me like your guidance excluding that is for accelerating growth. What am I missing there? Accelerating growth throughout 2008.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, you know your right that we have a full year impact of @Road acquisition in Q1 and I'll have to come back again to do it later on as to what that impact is. I'll have to go and, let's talk that Jeff on one-on-one. But yes, there is definitely full year impact.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: So let me twist that question slightly and ask you, do you expect your business climate to improve throughout 2008?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, the answer is no. I guess what we are basically postulating here today is that the environment is [Technical difficulty] It has to dramatically worsen from current level if the international account stays robust. But factoring in this is kind of business by business is what I would call, yes, an improving climate because but we can't talk about today is new products, we can't talk about other changes to the business we might be making in '08. So in general, we're very... whatever the macro economy may be and then it perfect illustrates, we are very pleased with our relative competitive positioning. We're pleased with what we've got in the pipeline, both from a product standpoint, from a business development standpoint, and in terms of other elements of execution. So I wouldn't characterize it as the next... that we're not counting on any real net change in the external environment. But we are pretty confident about the actions that we can take both in terms of developing new businesses, developing our existing businesses and the fact that that will likely have a positive effect as the year goes on. So probably where are you characterizing?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I mean Jeff; we have guidance of 17% to 19%, so @Road, if you add full quarter, there is probably impact of three to four points there. So if you take that out, you have 14% to 17% guidance growth rate, which is consistent with the full year guidance. So I won't say we are accelerating. We are probably giving the same guidance in Q1 as the fiscal full year.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Okay, so tell me what's driving the higher tax rate in '08?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Well, in tax rate in general, there is lot of moving pieces. There is R&D credits, there is manufacturing deductions. There is how the mix of international profits shape up, and generally we don't have anything structural in place, so typically federal tax is of 35%, and your state income tax tends to be two to three points. So at this point, our best guess is 38%. This year, we did get some benefits in terms of higher R&D credits and so forth, so we averaged to 36 this year, so we are calling for 38 and we're going to look at opportunities as we move through the year to see if we can come lower than that.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: So should I interpret that answer to mean you may spend less on R& D this year?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: No. It's a very complicated calculation in terms of how much R&D credits we have used in the past and what it was versus the base years. So, it's not as... our R&D is actually expenses going up year-over-year. It's how much credits you have used, how much are remaining. It all depends upon that. And so you are not calling for --
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: That's enough on taxes Raj, thanks.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Okay. So EU you had dramatic acceleration in your growth from Q3 to Q4. Was the EU growth impacted by some significant one-time sales?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't believe there were any significant one-time sales that would account for the quarter-to-quarter, I think it's some simply business as usual.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: I mean the economy over there is not growing 52%. You must be really building out a lot of distribution or what's going on in the EU?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean just characterizing in... just characterizing some of this as numerically meaningful, some of it isn't. So for example, if during the quarter or either late third quarter, during fourth quarter, for example on the Mobile Solutions side is @Road, which did have more of a European presence than Trimble had on Mobile Solutions took TrimWeb... the Trimble product brought it to market in Europe. So, if that is not numerically significant at this point of time but did add a certain amount of back round and started building a subscriber base in Europe really for the first time as the company using few of the synergistic effect of Trimble and @Road. Agriculture is after a number of years of kind of waiting in '07 starting to getting interesting in Europe. Western Europe is... provide the backdrop environmental regulations, environmental pressures are increasing, are creating an attractive market for agriculture in Western Europe, but Eastern Europe is getting very interesting because thanks to the prior political regimes there, the farms tend to be large, larger than in Western Europe and as we apply kind of up to date management practice to those farms is what we are saying as a very robust market for Eastern Europe; Ukraine, Russia, Poland and so, that's contributing some there. I think that when it comes to E&C again, there is a more of a growth environment in Europe than we have really seen though the last decade. Yes, may be a little spotty, but there against the backdrop of kind of a little, let's call it more optimism than in U.S. we've made a number of changes during the course of the year in terms distribution, we're intensifying our moves into distribution, I think net-net our distribution channel is significantly better in Europe than it was a year ago. And again, the Eastern Europe, European play also plays out relative to E&C in terms of some markets that are fundamentally less developed than the Western European markets and as result, we are able... we got more unpenetrated space in the east to go after, than we did in the west. So, I don't think there is any one thing that I would point out, point out relative to Europe, I think it's a lot of relatively little things that come together.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: That's great. Now conversely APAC growing 24%, I can't imagine you find that an acceptable growth rate Steve, what are your plans there?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again I kind of point to year-over-year there may be some statistical phase there, because China does tend to place larger orders in any point in time. So I tend to... I tend to look at the full year, where I think the growth rate was more like 30% in Asia Pacific and again there is Asia and then there is Pacific. I believe we are probably including Australia, New Zealand in that number. Australia is actually a significant number in that mix. If you actually looked it, we broke out if you will, Asia from Pacific in that case, it is what your are going to see is comparatively slower growth in New Zealand and Australia as you would expect and in a much more dynamic growth relative at the Asia, whether it be Southeast Asia, China, India. And so, again I think the aggregated number hides a little bit of the trend now.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Did you have some major orders in China that push from Q4 to Q1?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, again I don't, there is nothing that I can think of that would attribute anything. I'm just saying it's probably to get the real trend look at the full year as opposed suppose to the quarter number because the quarter number moves slightly around a little bit. I think the EBITDA half year or the full year number probably provides a little bit more certainty relative to actually what the trend looks like.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: All right, that sounds good. Adjust... I have got your adjusted E&C operating margins down 70 basis points year-over-year. Is that roughly correct?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: That's right.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: And you say that's a both mix and these acquisitions. So when do we get rid of the acquisitions in the count there and their unfortunate impact. Will that go away in Q1?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: There is two impacts, one with the product mix. Last year, Q4 was much... if you look at Q4 of '06 versus Q4 of '05, there is a significant margin expansion. And so, I don't know if it will go away in Q1 or Q2 but for full year it will definitely go away.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again Jeff, I'd be kind of pointing out either the half or the full year provides kind of better understanding and I think on the full year earnings we should show strong progression on margins, which I think probably represents a better baseline to use.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: So in E&C there Steve, what products sold particularly well in Q4 that hurt the mix?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, okay, so I would say its one thing, again I am afraid I am not sure that I can point kind of numerical effect. But as I said earlier is that what we saw was again comparatively stronger performance there. Let's talk of housing related products in the latter part of '07, so again, we kind of flushed it through earlier and the year-to-year performance for the housing related products which would be things like rotating light, lasers and such, actually done a stronger performance in the second half of '07. Those rotating lasers carry with them fundamentally lower gross and lower operating margins than other products. So in the background, those were having some effect. How... again, how numerically significant that was, I couldn't tell you, I am afraid here. But again I would say is don't focus too much on the fourth quarter, that was as much of matter of arithmetic. Nothing structural changed in that business really relative to pacing or cost, it was product mix in the fourth quarter and I would suspect in the first half of '08, it will return to kind of a normalized pattern.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Okay so --
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So Jeff can you please --
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: So it brings me to my key question here. I mean we have adjusted OMs for the year up 210 bps, we've got adjusted OMs for the quarter up 200 bps, but the guidance is for up a 100 bps. Are you just being conservative?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: I mean we have always said we will target 25% of... 20% to 25% operating leverage and this year we did expand our operating margins by 200 basis points. And 100 basis points is what we believe is the realistic guidance which leaves enough money for investment in the business. Our history would suggest that we have beaten that number.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Yes.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: And again as I said earlier is that the total year, back half for the year is still not totally transparent to us. And so I think going again listening to Wall Street and the talk about economic conditions I think, yes, we kept ourselves from discussion given the market condition and that margin improvement being hedged in order to call flexibility, I think that's a reasonable premise.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: Okay. Before I bore everyone to death, I'll hold it to one more question. It looks like your core TMS, in other words, your pre-@Road business was actually down year-over-year 5% to 10%. What's going on there?
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: I am not sure that's a good number. I think what has happened is that, starting really at the very beginning of the fourth quarter or end of third quarter, we, after running @Road pretty independently, the acquisition of those two organizations have been very much brought together and very much integrated and so for example, the productivity business which is called the kind of more mom and pop business, not the large scale business, the two operations there have been brought together. So I think relative to fourth quarter, I think it would be even hard for us to pull out one number, that's @Road and another number that's Trimble. Now I think the... the thing I didn't necessarily, I didn't actually address in the script that I had addressed in prior two or three quarters, is the fact that, well, let me break down the... since you've raised it... let me break down the historical Trimble business there a little bit. So already next concrete kind of a flagship application, that's one of these businesses that we are taking international very aggressively. So both Asia Pacific and Europe in the fourth quarter, we had meaningful activity that we'll start to translating into meaningful numbers during the course of the year. That we... at least the second and third quarters we have talked to the fact that we didn't in the Field Service segment or direct store delivery, we didn't really have a whole lot sale in 2007 because of a product transition. That we brought our product now, we now have a solution we refer to as Version 4, that's out in the marketplace. We expect that to... we are engaged with the marketplace, we are building a pipeline and we actually expect that business to turn around significantly in '08. So I don't think... I am not sure your number is actually right. In fact, I don't think it's right. But at the same time, I don't think the distinction between @Road and our historical TMS is actually a meaningful break any longer.
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: All right. Well congratulations on the great quarter. It doesn't look like you are going out of business any time soon.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: That spells on your...
Jeffrey Evanson - Dougherty & Company LLC: It's a joke.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: That better be a joke then.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Friedland with Soleil
Peter Friedland - Soleil: Hey guys, just a quick here. You have the share count going up a fair amount in '08 versus '07 and is that from acquisitions that you have already announced this year? And then what about the share repurchase you think, you'd see the shares go a down a bit, so, what's like, you think about that?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I think the share count is going up, we have the full year impact of showing @Road shares versus not having full year impact in '07. That's one of the reasons. And then no, we don't have baked in any impact of buyback. So to the extend, we buyback shares then that depends upon a lot of different factors, cash availability and the price and all and so forth, that should reduce the share count.
Peter Friedland - Soleil: And as far as the acquisitions that you already announced so far this year. Then would say rough order of magnitude, still a bit, it sort of cost us all of them?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Those are all in the same range as we have done historically. Our historical range could be if you look at the acquisitions they could be any where from $5 million to $30 million and we will continue to do acquisitions, our pipeline in that range right now and what we have announced is all in that range.
Peter Friedland - Soleil: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Research.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Hello, I am great here, every body okay?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: We got a three hour time advantage to you Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Yes I know, I know actually only two for me. One clarification very quickly, are you assuming an R&D tax credit in '08 right now in your 8% guidance?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: We are assuming the tax credit in '08 for that.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay, so you are assuming that there will be tax, I've seen your guidance at this point.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: How much was currency in the quarter from the year?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: On the operating as the dollar weakens, we will get benefit on the revenue side, but on the operating income side we are pretty close to hedge, actually it hurts us a little bit as dollar weakens because we have lot of expenses in Europe, in Sweden in New Zealand in Germany. So operating, but they are not material to our numbers. So we don't talk about it.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: In the sales number, I mean with the big sales gain you have 4%, 5% currency as most people did?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: 4%, 5% no, no, we probably have 1 point or 2 point something like that.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: So ultimately before that -- [Multiple speakers]
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: For the year, yes.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. Joint venture income which went down in the fourth quarter you mentioned something, can you talk about what happened in the fourth quarter with the JV income and what do you expect for '08?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, to be precise the foreign exchange impact was 2 points for the full year.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: I am sorry.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: The foreign exchange was 2 points for the full year.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. And the JV income?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: What was the question like, any way, does that --
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: The JV income was down in the fourth quarter?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it did. If you look at full year, it went up. We had a one-time favorability last year, where some we get... got some favorability from the warranty as well as in Q4. We have been accounting for warranty also in the quarter and then need the money. So we got a $1 million, a significant benefit in Q4 of last year. This was not... have been in Q4 of this year.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: You didn't have a warranty in '08 versus '07 I assume?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: That's right.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay, great. So it doesn't change?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So the revenue was up significantly, but we didn't get the benefit on the bottom line because... well, the profitability declined because we had a warranty favorability in '06 that might repeat itself in '07.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Now are you obsessed a lot by the Caterpillar inventory liquidation that went on all year and that was the gross rate will give you a better width in '08 than '07?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I think basically, that had... they had no effect either for the JV or for Trimble, so I would call it de minimus at best.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. And you talk about in the press release a potential for the Mobile Solutions business and then you talk about bringing Europe, bring it overseas, is your really reference to get the expected double-digit margin, is that the potential that you are talking about as opposed to the top line growth?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: For Mobile Solutions?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Yes.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Internationally?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Yes, well just for the whole sector.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Which still came out still up to single-digit numbers. I am talking about the potential for '08 and that's... is that the go rate to get to meaningful double-digit margins in that business in '08?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So I mean, I think we just reported for that segment for the quarter 14.8% as I remember operating margins. So obviously, and I think at the time we bought @Road is we talked in terms of getting @Road up to Trimble averages, let's call it Trimble average non-GAAP approaching 20% at this point of time. We talked about getting @Road up to the Trimble average within three years, I think it was and certainly we're well on our way there. Now, if we step back and look at that business from an operating margin standpoint, a software rich business profitability run is I would say is that business maybe not in '08 but in '09, '010, should be improving the Trimble average because fundamentally we view that as being a software business profitably run as having the potential for operating margins of 25% plus. And so that's our investment pieces here. And so far, we're on our way to getting that if you look at the progression of that business over time. I mean that business made money for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2005. So from a call it a breakeven position in fourth quarter of '05 two years later, we're now comfortably talking about double-digit operating margins there with significant capacity to improve those margins. So what we're looking out of that business is both top line growth and margin, operating profits growing significantly faster than that revenue growth.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. At what caused the tax rate to be down in the fourth quarter of versus say, was it... it was a surprise a bit, you know that I know to bring the average year gap from 37 to 36. But I guess what you expect is more closer to 38%, 39% tax rate in the fourth quarter and you are under the 35%.
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we have forecasted 38% and we came at 35%. Yes, we look at all the time kind of the provision in terms of what are the accruals, what is the effect, what our true-up has been on the federal tax returns and those are what we accrued. And as we look at all the accruals, we were... we made an adjustment to that. That had an impact of lowering the tax rate.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: And there is, is pricing minimal also... do you have a pricing number for '07, and what the pricing for '08, is something your guidance says also?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Pricing what product?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: You know real price impact? I am talking about the price impact on your numbers at all?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well I think, let me put it this way is that is a... any question that's unique to each individual business, we don't prescribe what's called a top down view of what's happening in the world. We let each business define that in the context of the market now. What I would characterize as being the case is that okay, we are not... we have not been for a number, any number of years subjected to what I would call significant pricing pressure. There is... being in a electronics world, electronics related world, yes, there is pricing pressure, but have we seen step functions now. And with a couple of exceptions and I actually pointed out one earlier, which is at the low-end agriculture product is where we have led the way on that one. But what we have typically seen and what we have typically used as our pricing paradigm here is that over time you see us come out with products with higher functionality that may retain the price more or less the price level of the prior generation products. So essentially, what the user is getting is significantly more functionality for the same price. I think that's the workable phenomenon in most of these markets at this point in time. And I think we pursue that from a marketing standpoint, which is deliver more value to the user, but not necessarily through the kind of the blunt instrument mechanism of simply reducing price.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: All right thank you.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan: Good afternoon
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan: Couple of questions here, when you look at your guidance, especially on the E&C segments, I mean how much are you incorporating any sort of conservatism for spreading that macro conditions to Europe or other countries and maybe you spreading into the small, commercial or large commercial construction projects?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think we've tried to be fairly clear on that which is why we are modeling at this point in time is what's called a picture for 2008 that looks kind of like a snapshot as it exists at this point in time, particularly as it relates to the international markets. We don't employ economists, we take the market as we find it, we react to that marketplace, we stay intimate with that marketplace, so I would say is that at this point in time, we are not kind of building an significant sophistication related to economic conditions, we will play it as it comes an we will just try to be as transparent on that as we see it.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan: Your OpEx went up in the quarter sequentially, how much of that is from foreign exchange, how much is that reinvestment or maybe charging to your international markets more, some of these segments?
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So Q4 tends to be seasonally a higher OpEx quarter versus Q3. We have some big user conference in Q4, where the expense goes up $2 million to $3 million, quarter-over-quarter. And then we kind of make adjustments for what we call our EP and bonuses and all that would also swing things from Q3 to Q4. So those are the two things that cause an increase from Q3 to Q4. There is no major change in terms of investments over there; it's primarily driven by those two factors.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan: And last question I had is on the Mobile Solutions, obviously, you had some good margin expansion in that segment this quarter. What more is there, I mean, I understand that you integrated data centers as we have, have you done some more efficiencies on the device you manufacturing and procurement of the materials?
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, as I pointed out, really, we... when we acquired @Road in February last year, I think the primary... I guess our first priority was not to screw it up. And so we were comparatively walking through the door we were... we listened, we booked, we discussed, but we were not necessarily precipitous in terms of doing anything other than the things that obviously made sense. But as we pointed out is the... we did take our incremental opportunities as the year went on, so the current @Road headcount is I call roughly, 10% plus down from where it was at the time of acquisition. A lot of that G&A related, lot of that is kind of infrastructure related. If you will, the second phase after kind of getting to know each other and getting a new management structure in place and getting better financial transparency, what I would call, careful synergies in the marketplace. So as I pointed out is that @Road if you will, what was @Road has taken the incremental product into the marketplace in Europe and half of it promoted that in four quarters. So we took our opportunities there. I think that given that the @Road employee group has become comfortable with Trimble, Trimble better understands the business. I would say at the beginning... really the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of larger corporate reorganization, we intensified the level of management integration, operational integration between Trimble Mobile Solutions and @Road and I would say today that by and large that they are acting as one unit and increasingly the identity of @Road will kind of be... will move towards the background of a larger Trimble identity. But in terms of things you mentioned, data centers, product and scale factors, other things, I would say it's still early days. So, I would say it's not ... we are now starting to move into more of an active phase of operational execution synergies. It really began less than... well, roughly three months ago. So, I think it's early days, so that I would say in general, the upside is of that sort of things still ahead of us.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Thanks a lot of for attending and I will talk to you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name isDennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I wouldlike to welcome everyone to the Trimble Navigation Third Quarter 2007 EarningsConference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.(Operator Instructions). I will now turn the call over to Ms. Willa McManmon. Pleasego ahead, ma'am.
Willa McManmon: Thank you. And thank you forjoining Trimble’s third quarter 2007 earnings call. I am here with Steve Berglund,our President and CEO, and Rajat Bahri, our CFO. Before we begin the call, let meremind you that during the course of this call, we will make projections orother forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financialperformance of the company. The words "intend," "expect," "plan,"or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Wewish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertaintiesthat could cause actual events or results to differ materially. Important factors relating to ourbusiness, including factors that could cause actual results to differ from ourforward-looking statements are described in our Forms 10-Q, 10-K and otherfilings with the SEC. The Company assumes no obligation to update theseforward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in assumptionsor other factors. With that, I will turn the callover to Steve.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. Trimble’s third quarter performance fit ourstandard operating model of revenue growth, tight control of costs, andextending operating margins. All Trimble segments demonstrated progressincluding good progression for @Road, which I will speak to later. Revenue grewby 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margins grew by 1.5 points, andoperating leverage was 25%. The E&C segment revenues for the quarter grew 12%year-over-year. This was less than the 18%, 12 month rolling growth rate forthe segment and presents an obvious question. The growth rate was impacted bytwo effects. The first is that as our software and services contentincreases, the deferred revenue recognition accounting is making it moredifficult for us to predict the specific period when revenue will be recognizedon the income statement. Besides [reinforcing] the need, as I did in the lastquarter's call for analyzing Trimble's performance over a multiple quarterbaseline, I will leave it to Rajat to describe the effects. The second effect impacting the E&C’s growth rate in thequarter has been that despite very strong international growth, we continue tosee pockets of slowness in the US,as we are since the beginning of the year. The uneven conditions we saw in the US surveyinstruments market in the first half of the year continued into the thirdquarter Our construction product sales, which had strong USgrowth in the first half reflected a slowdown in July and August with a sharpbounce back in September, which seems to be continuing into the fourth quarter.There is not an easy analytical base as to account for the relatively sharpchange of behavior in construction buying. From a strong second quarter to a slowing in July andAugust, with the rebound in September, our belief is that we saw something of aheadline factor in July and August in which contractors reacted to intensifyingspeculation on the effects of sub-prime meltdowns and resulting economicslowdown by cutting back on non-mandated expenditures. We believe the underlying market dynamics kicked in again inSeptember and will lead to stronger E&C growth performance in the fourthquarter. US conditions are highly variable across the country with some areasdemonstrating significant year-over-year growth, while other areas are slower.For 2008, we anticipate, based on what we can see at this point, E&C growththat is roughly consistent with that of 2007. The Field Solutions segment demonstrated strong performancein the quarter with another exceptional performance in agriculture resultingfrom a robust worldwide, farm economy and a strong, Trimble product portfolio.The other business in the segment, the Geographic Information Systems, grew ata double digit rate driven by new products. The Advanced Devices segment also demonstrated significantgrowth in the quarter with the components business reflecting continuing strongdemand, particularly for timing products. The Mobile Solutions segment continues to progress in linewith expectations. The historical business, centered on ready-mix concretedelivery, continued to build recurring revenues and underlying margins, andpublic safety demonstrates a strong year-to-year revenue growth. In prior quarter's calls, we described the direct storedelivery businesses trade on our segment results, while we await a new versionof the field service product platform. The rollout on that platform is underwayand we are seeing promising signs of market acceptance in the beginnings of anorders pipeline. The product provides the capability of extending a workercentric, field service software products into new areas to complement ourvehicle centric fleet management products. @Road, which we acquired eightmonths ago, remains either on track or ahead of the expectations at the time ofacquisition and demonstrates good revenue and profit progression in the quarter.The integration with the rest of Trimble has proceeded well. As an example, @Roadis in the process of taking products from TMS or other parts of Trimble tomarket in a number of countries around the world. Overall, @Road is also deliveringsignificant productivity increases with @Road related headcount down over 10%since the acquisition. We have seen significant margin improvements in theMobile Solutions segment year-over-year with the expectation for more in 2008,as @Road continues its progression, as we turn the top corner in the direct storedelivery business and as we continue to build recurring revenues in the legacybusinesses. We continue to believe in arobust 2008 consistent with our earlier expectations, while we must respect theincreased uncertainty in the USeconomy. We believe that the underlying drivers for success in 2008 remain inplace. They include continuing strong international growth, the potential forsignificant growth of revenues and margins in the mobile solutions segment aswe moved from the transition related activities in @Road to a top line focus. There is a continuing strongoutlook for agriculture with international growth in new product categoriescontributing more. Continuing growth within the E&C segment, as we takespecific actions inside the US to counteract regional slowness, as we extendour international reach, as we extend our product reach within the connectedconstruction site initiative and as we reinforce our underlying belief thatproductivity sales even in uncertain markets. Let me turn the call over to Raj.
Rajat Bahri: Good afternoon. Third quarter2007 revenue was $296 million, up 26% year-over-year. At the same time,deferred revenue was up 170% year-over-year from $24 million to $66 million. Inthe third quarter alone, our deferred balance grew by $14 million or 27%sequentially. Let me take a minute to discuss this.Over time, an increasing proportion of Trimble products are being sold at totalsolutions including hardware, software, subscription services and training.This leads to accounting, which tends to results in deferral of revenue streamsthat a portion of overall solution is under level. With the acquisition of @Road,the revenue in hardware has been deferred and recognized over the term of the contractualsoftware subscription period. Additionally, increased support and maintenanceservices have driven deferred revenue growth in our E&C business. For example, E&C deliveredhundreds of thousands of dollars of new survey products at the end ofSeptember. However, since fair value could not be established for an undeliveredelement within the solutions, the entire revenue stream was deferred. We expectto fully deliver and recognize revenue on these solutions in the fourthquarter. It is also important to look at a cash flow this year.  In many transactions we havereceived cash from our customers before the related revenue recognizing theP&L. The good news is that we will be able to recognize the revenue overtime. The flip side is that the moves up revenue, into and out of a givenquarter, make it difficult to forecast results on a quarterly basis within atight range. Subsequently, when timing revenue, recognition depends onrelatively subtle variation in contractual language. The revenue breakout by geographywas 56% in North America, 25% in Europe, 13%in Asia Pacific and 6% in the rest of the world. This represents a 19% increasein North America, 35% increase in Europe, 28%increase in Asia Pacific and 69% increase in rest of the world. Turning now to EPS, GAAP earnings per share were $0.22 flatwith the third quarter of 2006. When looking at year-over-year comparisons, itshould be noted that third quarter 2007 GAAP earnings were impacted by $0.05per share due to amortization of purchased intangibles and $0.02 per share dueto impact of FASB 123 (R). Adjusting for these expenses, non-GAAP earnings per sharewere $0.29 up 16% over the third quarter of 2006. The tax rate for the thirdquarter of 2007 was 39% compared to 35% in the third quarter of 2006, whichimpacted the comparative year-over-year EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter was $44 million, up 21%compared to the third quarter of 2006. Operating income in the third quarter of2007 was impacted by amortization of purchased intangibles of $10.2 million inthe third quarter of 2007, which represents an increase of $7.3 million overthe third quarter of 2006 due to acquisitions. There was a $3.8 million impactfrom stock-based compensation in the quarter versus the $2.9 million impactfrom stock-based compensation in the third quarter of 2006. Adjusting for these factors, non-GAAP operating income was$57.8 million in the third quarter of 2007, up 37% from the third quarter of2006. Operating margins for the third quarter of 2007 were 14.8% compared to15.5% in the third quarter of 2006. Again, adjusting for the above factors,non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 19.5%, up from 18% in the thirdquarter of 2006. This quarter, non-GAAP operating leverage was 25%. Thiswould have been much higher without the impact of acquisitions. The marginimprovement was driven by a slight expansion in gross margins and leverage ofoperating expenses. Now, I will turn to segment results, which exclude revenue,less cost of goods sold and operating expenses excluding general corporateexpenses, amortization of intangibles and in-process research and development. In addition for each segment, non-GAAP operating incomeexcludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Third quarter 2007E&C revenue was $182.1 million, up approximately 12% when compared torevenue of $162.4 million in the third quarter of 2006. In the third quarter, E&C experienced stronginternational growth, but lower USgrowth than in recent quarters due to certain pockets of weakness in the US market. Webelieve at this point that this is a short-term phenomenon, as Steve discussedduring his comments. Operating income in E&C was $42.8 million or 23.5% ofrevenue compared to $38.3 million or 23.6% of revenue in the third quarter of2006. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $43.7 million or 24% of revenuein the third quarter of 2007 compared to $39.2 million or 24.2% of revenue inthe third quarter of 2006. Third quarter 2007 Field Solutions revenue was $44.8 million,up 53% compared to $29.2 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2006. Salesof both agricultural and geographical information system products were strong,a particular strength driven by the continued worldwide, robust farm economy. Operating income in TFS was $11.9 million or 26.7% ofrevenue for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $5.6 million or 19.3% ofrevenue in the third quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in TFS was$12.1 million or 27% of revenue for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $5.9million or 20.1% of the revenue in the third quarter of 2006. Marginimprovement was mainly due to leveraging results from increased revenue. Third-quarter 2007 Mobile Solutions revenue was $39.2million up 139% from revenue of $16.4 million in the third quarter of 2006.Revenue growth was primarily due to the acquisition of @Road. Operating incomein TMS was $2.9 million or 7.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2007compared to $1.1 million or 6.8% of revenue in the third quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in TMS was $4.3 million or 10.9%of revenue for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $1.3 million or 7.9% ofrevenue in the third quarter of 2006. Margin improvement was largely due toimprovements in the @Road model as well as increases in subscribers in ready-mixoffsets by softness in the direct store delivery products. Third quarter 2007 advanced devicesrevenue was $29.9 million, up approximately 12% from revenue of $26.8 millionin the third quarter of 2006 due to the sales of timing products. Operatingincome in advanced devices was $4.9 million or 16.4% of revenue for the thirdquarter of 2007, compared to $4.1 million or 15.3% of revenue in the thirdquarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in advanceddevices was $5.2 million, 17.5% of revenue for the third quarter of 2007compared to $4.6 million or 17% of revenue in the third quarter of 2006. We arenow a full year into the Nokia agreements. Margin impact from that revenue hasbeen normalized. For the overall company, grossmargins for the third quarter of 2007 were 49.6%, and excluding theamortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, non-GAAP for grossmargin were 51.6%. This compares to GAAP gross margins of 49.5% and non-GAAPgross margin of 50.1% in the third quarter of 2006. Total operating expenses for thethird quarter of 2007 came in at $103.2 million or 35% of revenue compared to34% of revenue in the third quarter 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, operatingexpenses in the third quarter of 2007 were 32% of revenue, flat compared to thethird quarter of 2006. In the underlying businessoperating expenses as a percent of revenue decline, this is offset by dilutiveimpacts of acquisition, where operating expense is a percent of revenue higher.Non-operating income for the third quarter of 2007 was $1.1 million versus $2.7million in the third quarter of 2006. As this was the case last quarter, higherprofitability from the CTCT joint venture was offset by higher interest costrelated to debt for the @Road acquisition. Looking at the balance sheet, wefinished the third quarter of 2007 with $84.1 million in cash compared to $73.8million in the prior quarter. Our debt levels, primarily from @Road acquisitionat $81.1 million, are down from $123 million in the second quarter of 2007.Hence, our net debt position is zero at this point of time. In the third quarter, netaccounts receivable were $242.6 million, compared to $235.2 million in thesecond quarter of 2007. Inventory was $142.2 million compared to $137.7 millionin the second quarter of 2007. Its turns were essentially 4.3, flat to theprior quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first three quarters of 2007was $129.1 million, an increase of 51% over the first three quarters of 2006. Turning now to our guidance forthe fourth quarter of 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we expect revenue togrow 26% to 28% compared to fourth quarter of 2006, with revenue between $295million and $300 million. We expect fourth quarter 2007 GAAP earnings per sharebetween $0.17 and $0.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.24 and$0.26. Non-GAAP guidance for the fourthquarter of 2007 excludes the amortization of intangibles of $10 million relatedto previous acquisitions and anticipated impact of stock-based compensationexpense of $3.8 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance is at a 39% tax ratecompared to an actual 25% tax rate into the fourth quarter of 2006 and assume$126 million shares outstanding. We will now take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come fromthe line of Paul Coster with JP Morgan.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan: Thank you. Raj, perhaps you could just elaborate a littlebit on the deferred revenue, I think I missed it slightly. You started off, itsounded like it was software related and in the end, actually the conclusion ifit’s more related to the @Road service. Can you just sort of clarify a littlebit that please?
Rajat Bahri: Sure. Actually, Paul, it is both. It’s related to @Road aswell as, it's related to the fact that our increasing portion of our productsare becoming more software oriented and as being sold as the bundled solutions.So, both of those factors are driving growth in our deferred revenue balance.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan: It would therefore make sense that what is in the deferredrevenue balance probably is higher than the average margin for the Corporation,is that correct?
Rajat Bahri: Well, the hardware margin tends to be a little bit lowerthan the base. But the other portion, yes, the remaining portion should be atmuch higher margin revenue.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan: Okay. Any currency effect that we should be aware of thisquarter?
Rajat Bahri: Yes. The dollar did weaken against most of the currency. So,we did get slight revenue uplift because of that. And on the operating income,we had a slight hit because a lot of our expenses are in Europe, the R&Dexpenses, New Zealand.So, we had a slight positive impact on the revenue and a slight negative impacton operating income.
Paul Coster - JPMorgan: Can you share with us the subscriber growth rate for theMobile Solutions business and the churn rate, if possible, and how that'strending?
Rajat Bahri: No. We’ve decided long ago that we wouldn't disclose thesubscriber related numbers that we prefer to be graded on our financialperformance not on subscriber performance. 
Paul Coster - JPMorgan: Okay, got it. And then my last question; you mentioned thatsome regions in North America are a little bitsoft at the moment. Can you provide us with a little bit of granularity thereplease, Steve?
Steve Berglund: Yeah. So, it is variable. They are the logical places suchas Florida,which right now is down, as you would expect. And then in certain areas in theSouthwest, but it's actually quite catchy as to on a regional basis. Now theother factor is that if you really dissect the data and look for meaning in thedata, it's not just regional, it's actually different customer groups arereacting differently as well. And some are actually down; some are up sharply. So, I think there is a fair amount of opportunity for us toexploit that data to focus on the areas one that are still doing quite well andto put more attention on those. And then to go and look at some of the areasboth regionally and from a market segment standpoint, where we could probablydo a better job of pinpointing responses to those. So, there isn’t an overall storyfor the US,it largely depends. But the one region that’s logical that I would offer upbeing Floridaas a pretty tough environment at this point in time. I don't necessarily wantto give away too much pretty action data here in terms of where we may belooking at regionally 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come fromthe line of Jeff Evanson with Dougherty & Company.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Good afternoon. Thanks for takingmy question. Steve you mentioned that you might be looking to make some adjustmentsin E&C business considering the environment in the US. Could you elaborate on whattypes of things you might be looking at doing? Steven Berglund Well, I don't want to overdothat. But given the market data that we were looking at particularly on surveyinstruments, is they are – our things like due to and on both the distributionchannel side and relative to our market focus to exploit the data if you will. Again it’s a very uneven picture,as it has been since the beginning of the year. We’ve been comparing 2007against an extraordinarily good year in 2006. And so some of that is just acomparison issue year-over-year, but I don't necessarily want to again giveaway marketing programs before we launch them or actions before we undertakethem. But again looking for where wecould do better, some of this is fundamental, some of this is tactical. But Idon't think we have to be passive victims to market conditions, againunderlying promise here is that even in a software market or an uneven market,we can saw productivity and still our intention is that. We think that we cansell our way through this until things get better.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: So, I know you track yourdistributors very carefully and with a lot of granularity. It sounds likeyou're working through where the patterns are, but it seems like maybe thepatterns are coming through. Do you think this is a distributor performanceissue?
Steve Berglund: I would not call it a distributorperformance issue. I would call a distributor focus issue. Now, we all makechoices on a daily basis in terms of where we put our activity and I would sayis that the relative focus of a year ago, which may have been totallyappropriate a year ago and where people are going to look for business. In a changed market situation itmay not be as appropriate as, say, today. And where we can help ourdistribution and therefore help ourselves is by refocusing on those areas,where we think there is a higher potential for results in the next three to sixmonths. And that we are developing a better insight in terms of what thosepoints of focus should be and what the actions are that we should take.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: And I guess I’m encouraged by thefact that you are taking a strategic view this is oppose to a cost cutting youwould suggest that you don't see this as a systemic issue?
Steve Berglund: No, we actually don't see it as asystemic issue. Now, we are watching for signs that the world is changing allthe time, a little bit of paranoia serves our interest here. But no, we do notsee it has systemic. We've been pretty consistent on that message all yearlong.  The market is, for lack of the better word I would call,uneven at this point in time and certainly not as robust as it was. That thesurvey instruments market is not as robust in the US as it was a year ago. Now, goinginto 2008 we get a little bit of relief just because we have a lower baselineto measure ourselves against in 2007. And so the year-to-year performancebecomes somewhat easier going into next year having gone through a full year ofthis. But I think, we’ve a belief is that we can take actions to counteractwhatever market forces are out there at this point and time, and that this wasnot as you say a systemic problem.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay, good. A few questions on TMS and is probably goes moreto Raj to start. Raj, in the sense, I guess what you told us is as you aregetting your hands around the accountings for the TMS division; it’s little bitchallenging to forecast. Could you talk about your ability to improve yourvisibility there in time?
Rajat Bahri: Well. I think I was referring to that on the E&C side ofthings versus on the TMS side of things. On the TMS side, we’ve got thehardware, deferred revenue and that gets amortized over certain period of time.So, that’s relatively easier to predict. The issues come, when you have inE&C, for example, a multiple contract, which includes hardware, software,training, subscription services and what we’ve done into this when you have, wemay have delivered 90% of the value even if you have delivered 100% of thevalue you need to establish on each element what is the fair value. In other words, what would that element be if it starts tostandalone on its own merits? And if you're not successful in establishing thatfair value, you end up deferring the whole streams of revenue. And that's whathappened in the Q3 on a few hundred thousands, I mean, in a lot of productsthat we sold in September. So, the lack of predictability is more from thosetypes of things. Hardware is actually and it’s relatively easier to predict.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay. So, sales of this nature always going to make itdifficult for you to forecast at quarter end?
Rajat Bahri: Yes. Within the $5 million range, we gave a range of $5million and there may be $3, $4 million growth of value which if you don'testablish the fair value could move into next quarter or the following quarter.And so that causes certain variation in the forecast just within that range.So, the margins have become very difficult, which happened this quarter. Wemoved some E&C revenue into Q4 because we can’t establish some fair valueon some elements.
Steve Berglund: So, Jeff, let me step in here too and just to emphasizeanother, well emphasize two points maybe. One is the business is changing andduring the last year has changed significantly on us both because of what weare doing in the product range, we’ve gotten. So, we’re adapting to thatchange. We will get better out of it. We are not going to (inaudible) rate. ButI think that there is naturally more volatility in the business. The other thing beyond just called the technical revenuerecognition aspects of whether exactly, when a contract is going to berecognized as demand is getting lumpier and at the margin in this company, aswe add @Road, as TMS scales up even in E&C, when we are in operatinginternationally we are taking in more tendered business. So, there are kind of more binary elements of largecontracts that are either in or out and given again the requirements of techeven if we substantially performed on many of those contracts they may againstthe total fallout of the quarter just because we’ve only accomplished 98% ofwhat we need to do. So, the numbers are larger andare either in or out. It tends to be a fairly binary world. So, it’s a newworld for us. We are adapting to it. Clearly we don't have the equation fullydealt in related forecasting. It will work out. But I'm not sure that is goingto be possible necessarily be as accurate as we have been historically onrevenue during the given quarter.
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay. Thanks a lot. I will getback in the queue.
Operator: Your next question will come fromthe line of Yair Reinerwith CIBC.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: Good afternoon. The questionfirst on in the Mobile Solutions. It appears that revenue was down sequentiallyfor the first time in quite a while, any kind of granularity about what’sbehind that?
Steve Berglund: Yeah. In general the issue thatwe are highlighting here is that, if you look at the fundamentals, we are atthe moment and we will be for probably another quarter getting comparatively,well hammered on the Direct Store Delivery business, while we await the fullarrival of the new products, So all other aspects of thebusiness are performing what I recall on-target, the Direct Store Deliverybusiness is dragging us down. So that point on a sequential basis, we had someissues, but it was all related to Direct Store Delivery. @Road is showing sequentialimprovement there. Recurring revenues are growing in the historical business.So, they are getting stronger as this Direct Store Delivery issue that isdragging us down at the moment. But again, we believe that we have a fix inprocess and that is we move into 2008 and should get better.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: You expect that part of thebusiness to come back that was in two or three quarters?
Steve Berglund: Yes. I think, for two reasons.There is a kind of strategic ground here and there is one that relates to thespecific revenue associated with that segment. So, this new software product,we call it V4, internally I guess stands version four. But it's a field service,field support platform that will be initially used in Direct Store Delivery andgive us a shot of adrenalin in the Direct Store Delivery. But it also provides,it's a platform product that is going to be a significant for other elements ofTrimble including @Road. And so as we roll this software out progressively itwill come out in an initial version and then we'll add functionalityprogressively over the course of the next year. This enables us to go access.Well, reinforce the presence in Direct Store Delivery with very strong inproduct and then also allows us to, here because it’s a platform product tobring into other markets round as well. So, this must be a reason to be hopefuland specifically in the Direct Store Delivery, but also I think we're gettingourselves in a strategic platform to bring to the marketplace in general.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: Fair enough. And now severalmonths into the @Road acquisition, how do you feel morale was doing at @Road?
Steve Berglund: Morale, morale is good. That thetransition has gone well. Again what we’ve done in the first, six, seven, eightmonths is, we have installed the new management group. And they are veryengaged and very energetic. Most of those were promotions from within @Road. Only the HR function and the financial function have beenstaffed from outside of @Road. We have organized @Road into a number of newincome statements from one kind of a [morfis] income statement into a number ofincome statements. Consistant with the way Trimble operates and I think thateach month that goes by those new income statement are taking on new meaningand influencing decision making. So, and I think everyone at @Road drove the sameprogression. Now again, we’ve taken a couple of specific kind of rifle shot onefforts to reduce headcount. So, obviously those are never easy, but I thinkthose have gone well. So, I think pretty much on a worldwide basis for @Roadis, I would describe morale has been good.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: Okay. One final question before I get back into queue.Speaking of headcount reductions you had actually a nice drop off in totaloperating expenses to the tune of about $8 million. Were there any one-timeitems there, or it’s just basically the new base kind of moving forward?
Rajat Bahri: Clearly on @Road we’re making progress. But other thingsthat we’ve some trade shows in Q2 that will not repeated in Q3. So, in certainways, those tend to be more of a seasonal impact. I would say those are the twothings that are driving the drop off.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: Great. I’ll get back to queue.
Rajat Bahri: So, Q4 will come back a little bit because we’ve couple ofuser conferences and things going on in Q4.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: But if you look at Q4, it should return kind of to thatnormal seasonal pattern relative to Q3?
Rajat Bahri: That's right.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Corey Tobinwith the William Blair & Company.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: Hi good afternoon. A couple of things if I could please;Steve, in your comments you mentioned July and august being soft in the E&Cbusiness. Can you just give us a little bit more clarity there perhaps somefeeling for the size of the slowdown, was it negative in terms of absolutegrowth in those two months and now it’s bounced back or was it just sort offlat?
Steve Berglund: I don't necessarily want to characterize it too closely.Let’s just say, it was against the backdrop of April, May and June. It was alittle bit of a shocker because there was a real break in the trend line. AndI'm talking specifically about construction here; I’m not talking about surveyinstruments; I’m talking specifically about construction here. And it came backcharacterizing and usually it's roaring back in September. But it was a definite break in the trend line and itcouldn’t really be explained by what I would call macro market data or anythingelse and then September, some September came, they came back strongly. Andthrough that’s far that the September trend seems to be continuing intoOctober. So, a bit of a mystery very hard to identify specifically why but it'sjust kind of slowdown there for a while.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: And again that churn was just in the United States, right?
Steve Berglund: Only the US.International is pretty much everywhere internationally at this moment isstrong to extremely strong.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: And along the same lines. I think in your comment, just wantto make sure, if I heard this correctly you said E&C growth in 2008 shouldbe consistent with ’07, so the growth rate should be consistent in ’08, is thatcorrect?
Steve Berglund: Yeah, plus or minus is too early to call terribly closely.But I think, what we are trying to communicate here is that this on the evenstates exist in the US, as we look globally, as we look to the specific actionswe can take, our sense is that overall, when it comes to E&C is we shouldbe delivering in'08 largely consistent with '07 as it comes to growth rates.Obviously, there is a plus minus factor there and it’s way too early to try toquantify that. But our view of the market hasn't necessarily been displacedfrom what it was three months ago or even six months ago.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: Okay, great. Two more, if I mayquickly. Can you quantify how much of the increase in sequential increaserather in deferred revenue was from the E&C and AEC segments?
Rajat Bahri: So the sequential increase wasaround $14 million. And I'll give you -- just give you rough numbers. So, letme talk year-over-year. Year-over-year increase, we increased $66 million ofthat, in around $24 million was @Road and the rest was spread against E&Cin other segments. And of the $14 million increasethat we saw sequentially, again I giving you rough number. I don’t have exactnumbers with me that probably around $3 to $4 million was driven by E&C.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: In the most recent quarter?
Rajat Bahri: Yeah.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: Okay great. And finally just withrespect to visibility I know it’s typically only a couple of weeks. But if youseen the notable change either in terms of becoming longer or in terms ofdecreasing visibility in the business. Thanks.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: Can you repeat that?
Yair Reiner - CIBC: Is in terms of visibility and interms of revenue visibility do you seen any change, what you would think oftypical amount of visibility which you have in the revenue stream?
Rajat Bahri: I’d say it’s unchanged. It’snever good in this business, outside of places like @Road, where there is anactual, there is a kind of more of a contractual flow, but in E&C and AECand GIS for that matter is a broken burned business. And so, we are not working afterthe contractual backlog. Revenue visibility is never particularly good in eachbusiness in a classical sense of terms, not exactly for the next set ofrevenues that are coming. But in terms of relative confusion, clearly we hadsome issues in July and August. But in terms of clarity and in terms of visibility at thispoint in time, we returned to what I would call a normal pattern at this pointin time.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: And just to be quite typically if memory serves there aretwo to three weeks is the typical pattern, is that right?
Steve Berglund: Yeah. In terms of kind of backlog in place it’s again, it’snot the question, I can’t answer because I don't even worry about backlogbecause it’s a non-factor in the company. But, it's probably on that order ofmagnitude.
Corey Tobin - WilliamBlair & Company: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of ScottSutherland with Wedbush Morgan Securities.
Scott Sutherland -Wedbush Morgan Securities: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon.
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon Scott.
Scott Sutherland -Wedbush Morgan Securities: I had a couple of questions here (inaudible) asked you. Butwhen you could tell might be in the prepared remarks you said 39% tax rate forQ4?
Steve Berglund: That's right.
Scott Sutherland -Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay. Steve, can you talk about how you are seeing differentmarkets within the US, the non-residential, public residential if you're seeingdifferences in those types of markets?
Steve Berglund: Yeah. So, the story remains kind of unchanged from priorquarters is clearly residential is under pressure, well it’s under pressureeverywhere in the US.It’s certainly under more extreme pressure in places like Florida. And I think in Florida, there have been some flow overinto, let’s call it, at least a small scale commercial development, and in somecases, even to large scale commercial development. I think the market for commercialdevelopment isn’t as hot as it once was, but it’s still comparatively wide. Andthen the market that tends to be statistically most important for us is heavyand highway. And I think that the environment may have changed from astandpoint that contractors a year ago, a year and half ago were probablylooking after the multiple year backlog of business, that backlog is probablychunked. But overall we see for us and welook at market differently than a heavy equipment manufacturer obviously. Butfor us there is a -- it remains on historical terms comparatively healthy andsomething we can sell into, they’re still a lot of cash flow there maybeagainst a different perspective is that there has been some change toyear-over-year, but still comparatively healthy environment overall from ourperspective.
Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay. And Steve, as youmentioned, the sequential decline was mostly Direct Store Delivery. When you goout to potential customers or types of potential customers is it that they knowthe new solution is coming? They are waiting to buy the new solution, or isthat the reason, or it’s another reason why it’s holding up some of the salesthere?
Steve Berglund: No. It’s fair to characterize itthat way, maybe I embellished that a little more, is that to a fair extent. Weacquired the 11 now sometime ago, but the version three product just wasn’tsubstantial enough, wasn't muscular enough, wasn't functional enough. And so we have not actually beenactively marketing the version three. So what we kind of only [quality] 11where a whole lot of contraction commitments and built around this versionthree software that we needed to meet. And we have spent some significanteffort meeting the contractual commitments around version three. In other words we’ve been deploying resources on what it’s akind of a dead end from a strategic standpoint, while we prepare version four.So, yeah people have been expecting something to come, but I think its morematter of the fact that we haven't been actually marketing a product that was,that we didn't intent to support. So we have been holding back a bit waitingfor version four. Version four is now in the process of rolling out. So, we nowhave something to go out and sell. There will be a ramp up time obviously. Butwe’re feeling much better about the prospects for this business than we werethree to nine months ago.
Scott Sutherland -Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay. And the last question for Raj maybe in the TMS, youmentioned that @Road grew sequentially. Are you guys still showing a revenuenumber there for @Road?
Rajat Bahri: We’ve given the early number of around a range of $80 to $85million. We are going to hit that range.
Scott Sutherland -Wedbush Morgan Securities: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Noelle Swatland with Lehman Brothers.
Noelle Swatland -Lehman Brothers: Thanks guys. Two questions; maybe first could you justcomment was there any particular strength in international markets you can pointedon the E&C side any new contracts that are expected to continue to buildinto the fourth quarter? Secondly, you have given some thoughts on the E&Cbusiness for 2008. Can you comment or provide any thoughts for the FieldSolutions business. And then also just for Raj any updated thoughts from a taxperspective some of the work that you may have been doing there over the lastthree months found in your comments that you would say with respective tolowering that rate? Thanks.
Steve Berglund: Okay. So, first of all on theinternational side. I’m trying to recall whether there are any points of notein international in the last few months to point to. Let me characterize it bysaying that we’re showing into infrastructure through E&C. So and there is greatdeal of money being spent on the infrastructure in any number of developingareas of the world. So, for example not going to resolve that significant [thecountry benign]. We just are in the process of installing the infrastructuresolution there to give them the infrastructure that actually do a better jobsurveying property lines, as a way of establishing ownership rights. So there are a lot of thoseacross the world, but let me just characterize by saying the internationalgrowth is widespread, in some cases coming of the relatively small base. So theabsolute dollar numbers may not be all that significant, but the percentagegrowth rates are significant. So what we are seeing is both in South Africa and increasingly other parts of Africa, where there was a great deal of theinfrastructure development going on. The Middle East is very strong for us at this point in time. Indiafrom a small base is growing rapidly. China from a larger base is growingrapidly. Europe at this point in time isstrong for us. So I’d characterize widespread during the whole lot ofnecessarily specific examples that I could point to that would account foranything that's meaningful or material or relative to be and see resultsinternationally. Now as far as 2008 in field solutions,breaking that into its two components; GIS Geographic Information System is astrong financial model. It’s growing in the double-digits. It’s growing in theteens. Typically we would expect that to continue. The one elements that newthere, is with the acquisition of Spacient, we willbe getting a little more, more strongly in to utilities as a market focus inGIS. We would expect that to continue into 2008. The dollar amounts in 2008 from revenues should have may notbe always significant but we are positioning ourselves going forward.Agriculture is having a phenomenal 2007 [across] a challenge baseline for 2008.But going into 2008 what we are seeing in my view is still very strongenvironment in general. In North America, we areseeing some very strong growth internationally there as well. That’s far thatbusiness has been largely focus on North America, Braziland Australia.We are starting to see growth in other places such as Europefrom agriculture that have not necessarily been all that significant for us. So, we are seeing a robust environment in that matter. Weare seeing a robust environment internationally in agriculture. And then wehope to improve on that picture by continuing to expand the functionality ofour products. So, we would also expect some product booster as well. So,overall just aggregating those two together, we are expecting a good 2008 inField Solutions.
Rajat Bahri: Well, on the tax rate what we're doing is as ourinternational growth is growing is phenomenal at this point as you are seeingthe growth rate. And we looking at how we streamline our supply chain overallfor the company and support this international growth rate. And by looking at that we are looking at things what it doesdo to our legal entity structure and what are the tax implications of thosethings. But it’s too early for me to say they will be successful in it or not.So, I'm probably three to six months away telling you whether I was successfulin doing something or not.
Noelle Swatland -Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Spinolawith Needham & Company.
Andrew Spinola - Needham & Company: Raj, should we then stick withthe 39% as the tax rate for 2008?
Rajat Bahri: At this point I’d range it, youknow 37 to 39.
Andrew Spinola - Needham& Company: Okay. Just one question, if Ilook at the expenses in the corporate and other segment is sort of the plugbetween the segment, operating incomes and your corporate operating income, itlooks like that was down to negative $7.5 million in the quarter, which wasjust 2.5% of revenue that's typically run around 3.5% of revenue. So anything related to corporateexpenses that was lower this quarter or just potentially sort of a new lowertrend line going forward?
Rajat Bahri: Q1, Q2 were on the high side ofthing. Q3 is probably on the lower kind of thing. I’d say somewhere in themiddle going forward. There were some legal expenses, one-time legal expense inthe first half that we will not incurred that's why Q2. Q3 dropped significantly and thenobviously there is a issue of bonuses, how we grew for bonuses in thefirst-half versus second half, proper conjunctions change also have been impacton quarter-to-quarter results, but clearly first half was in the higher side.
Andrew Spinola - Needham& Company: Okay. And actually last questiondo you by any chance how the revenue from acquisitions in the quarter?
Rajat Bahri: We have not disclosed @Road giventhe yearly number and excluding @Road we are running at a normal rate of, ifyou look at historically we depending upon, which quarter we have ranged fromaround 3% or so on rest of the stuff.
Andrew Spinola - Needham& Company: Okay.
Rajat Bahri: With minor acquisitions.
Andrew Spinola - Needham& Company: Thank you.
Rajat Bahri: And there is no reason to thinkthat would be different.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-upquestion from the line of Yair Reiner with CIBC.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: A quick follow-up, you said a lot of new survey instrumentsby the month and half ago. I just wondering if you can give us some kind offeel for how those are being accepted by your channel and by the marketplace?
Steve Berglund: I think the product that you are probably talking about isthe new intermediate scanner, half of the VX platform, which is the extensionof our S6 underlying platform. So, I think on reality is probably too soon tocharacterize the market acceptance one way or another. I think that over all the platform is success and thislatest product is really intended to if you work fit in between in an upper endand lower end product and provide users in a specific niche with the solution.So, I’m anticipating that will be successful. But at this point in time, Ithink, it’s too early to really characterize it one way or another honesty.
Yair Reiner - CIBC: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And at this time, there are nofurther questions.
Steve Berglund: I appreciate you attending the call and talk to you nextquarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the TrimbleNavigation third quarter 2007 earnings call. You may now disconnect.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Ms. McManmon, you may begin your conference. 
Willa McManmon - Director of Investor Relations: Thank you. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2007 conference call. I am here with Steve Berglund, our CEO and Raj Bahri, our CFO. A press release summarizing the financial results we are about to discuss is available on the IR section of our website.

Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon. Let me begin by acknowledging the passing of Bob Cooper, the Trimble Chairman of the Board who died on July 2nd. Bob had been on the Trimble Board since 1989 and had served as Chairman since 1998. His career spanned academia, government service and business. But whatever his role, technology was always his central passion. As the head of DARPA in the 1980s, he made decisions which were crucial to the creation of the GPS system. On the Trimble Board, he provided the visionaries perspective combined with linear common sense and profound humility.  Dr. Ulf Johansson was elected to replace Bob as Chairman. Ulf has been a member of the Trimble Board since 1999. He is a Swede who received his PhD in Communications. He spent the bulk of his early career at Ericsson, was the Founder of Europolitan, a Swedish wireless carrier and was Chairman of the University Board of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. He sits on a number of European boards, including Ericsson's. We believe his appointment reinforces a number of important themes. First is our continuing commitment to technology and in particular the growing importance of wireless technology. Second, by electing a European with an extensive international experience set, we are reinforcing our commitment to becoming a truly international company. Third, Ulf has been an active chair of the Audit Committee and his election emphasizes our fundamental commitment to good corporate governance.  The second quarter performance reflected continuing strong financial performance. Baseline quarter performance across all of Trimble segments demonstrated progression on both the top and bottom lines. Total revenue grew by 34% and non-GAAP operating margins reflected an improvement of 2.5 points over the second quarter of 2006 on the strength of operating leverage of 29%, which would have been higher without the impact of @Road.  The Engineering and Construction business continues to perform well with some changes in the mix of the business. Aside from the residential construction slowdown in the U.S., which has not had a material impact on our overall results, the construction market continues to be strong worldwide.  The pockets of slowness in the U.S. survey instruments market we reported last quarter continued in the second quarter, but was more than offset by strong international markets. With what we can see at this point, the changes in the U.S. survey instruments market do not appear to be a fundamental market or competitive shift, but are more in the category of a short-term market recalibration which doesn't change our views on longer term growth.  Our international sales growth in the E&C segment has been impressive with underlying factors allowing us to expect this growth to continue for several years. These factors include an improving European economy, generally robust economies in developing regions, significant planned infrastructure projects in Russia, Asia and Africa and a growing Trimble physical presence in the developing world. For example, in August, we will officially open a Trimble owned factory in Shanghai that will manufacture survey instruments for both the Chinese and international markets.  The Field Solutions segment demonstrate strong performance in the quarter with exceptional performance from agriculture, resulting from a robust worldwide farm economy and a strong Trimble product portfolio. Our EZ-Guide 500 Lightbar product, which was introduced late in the first quarter, was met by a very positive market reaction which drove much of the growth in the quarter. The other business in the segment, Geographic Information Systems, grew at a double-digit rate, driven by new products. The Advanced Devices segment also demonstrated significant growth in the quarter with the components business reflecting continuing strong demand for non-automotive embedded applications and timing products.  The Mobile Solutions segment continues its progression in line with expectations. The historical business, centered on ready mix concrete continued to build recurring revenues and underlying margins. Public safety demonstrated strong revenue growth and approving margins and direct store delivery remains a story in development as we await the full implementation of the next technology generation which will be completed in 2008.  @Road, which we acquired five months remains on track with our expectations at the time of acquisition and was profitable in the quarter. While the @Road margin is not yet at the Trimble average, the organization demonstrated meaningful progression during the quarter. We expect to see continual improvement in profitability during 2007 with significant profitability improvement in 2008 as we work through the effects of the accounting for deferred revenue, complete a number of large contracts with front-loaded costs and realize the efficiencies and synergies of programs that are being put in place in 2007.  The acquisitions and internal development of the last few years have shifted the profile of the E&C and Mobile Solutions segments. First, the mix of the business has shifted somewhat to larger contracts and have become lumpier. Second, the software and services content in these segments is growing rapidly. The lumpiness of the demand combined with the requirement to defer growing amounts of revenue makes it important to understand underlying trends and not to place excessive reliance on any given quarter.  That said, all Trimble segments are performing well with an improved overall outlook for 2007. If economic conditions remain relatively unchanged, we expect this trend to continue into 2008 as the strategic moves we have made in the last two years begin to pay off.  Let me turn the call over to Raj. 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Good afternoon. Second quarter 2007 revenue was $327.7 million, up 34% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, up from $0.25 in the second quarter of 2006. When looking at year-over-year comparisons, it should be noted that the second quarter 2007 GAAP earnings were impacted by $0.05 per share due to high amortization of purchase intangibles and $0.02 per share due to impact of FAS 123R. Adjusting for these expenses, non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.35, up 21% over the second quarter of 2006.  The tax rate for the second quarter of 2007 was 38% compared to 31% in the second quarter of 2006. Looking forward, we expect the tax rate for the remaining part of the year to be around 38%.  Operating income for the quarter was $56 million, up 45% compared to the second quarter of 2006. Operating income in the second quarter of 2007 was impacted by amortization of purchase intangibles of $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2007, which represents an increase of $6.7 million over the second quarter of 2006 due to acquisitions, a $3.8 million impact from stock-based compensation in the quarter versus a $3.3 million impact from stock-based compensation in the second quarter of 2006, a $333,000 restructuring expense compared to no restructuring expense in the second quarter of 2006.  There was no in-process research and development expense in the second quarter of 2007, but there is a $1 million in-process research and development expense taken in the second quarter of 2006.  Adjusting for these factors, non-GAAP operating income was $70.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, up 51% from the second quarter of 2006. Operating income margins for the second quarter of 2007 were 17.1%, up from 15.8% in the second quarter of 2006. Again, adjusting for the factors I just mentioned, non-GAAP operating income margins for the quarter were 21.5%, an increase of 2.5 points over the second quarter of 2006. The margin improvement was driven by improvement of mix in the E&C business, higher subscription in software revenue and leveraging of operating expenses. This quarter, 29% of incremental revenue dropped to the operating income line.  Now I will turn to the results by segment, which include revenue less cost of goods sold and operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses, amortization of intangibles, in-process research and development and restructuring expense. In addition, for each segment, non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense.  Second quarter 2007 E&C revenue was $198.9 million, up approximately 18% when compared to revenue of $168 million in the second quarter of 2006. E&C growth was driven by growth in most product categories and particularly strong international sales.  Operating income in E&C was $52.4 million or 26.3% of revenue compared to $38.8 million or 23.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in E&C was $53.2 million or 26.7% of revenue in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $39.9 million or 23.7% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Growth in operating margin was mainly due to favorable product mix and leveraging of operating expenses.  Second quarter 2007 Field Solutions revenue was $55.3 million, up 52% when compared to $36.3 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Revenue growth was driven by positive agricultural market conditions, robust new product agricultural sales, particularly the introduction of the EZ-Guide 500 and GIS products.  Operating income in TFS was $18.4 million or 33.3% of revenue for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $11.3 million or 31.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income was $18.6 million of 33.6% of revenue for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $11.5 million or 31.8% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Growth in operating margin was driven by higher revenue.  Second quarter 2007 Mobile Solutions revenue was $40.9 million, up 176% from revenue of $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. Operating income in the Mobile Solution was $2.9 million or 7.1% of revenue for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $374,000 or 2.5% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in Mobile Solutions was $4.4 million at 10.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $538,000 or 3.6% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Improvement in the operating margin was due to higher subscription revenue as well as increased profitability in @Road.  Second quarter 2007 Advanced Devices revenue was $32.7 million, up approximately 25% from revenue of $26.1 million in the second quarter of 2006, primarily due to strong sales of embedded products. Operating income in Advanced Devices was $5.4 million or 16.5% of revenue for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $2.2 million or 8.6% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in Advanced Devices was $5.7 million or 17.4% of revenue for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $2.7 million or 10.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006. Margin improvement was driven by mix of business in the component technology business and inclusion of Nokia licensing revenue.  For the overall company, gross margins for the second quarter of 2007 were 51% excluding the impact of amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margins were 52.7%. This compares to gross margins of 49.6% and non-GAAP gross margins of 50.3% in the second quarter of 2006. The improvement in margins was due primarily to higher revenue, product mix and improvement in the Mobile Solutions model.  Revenue break out by geography was 57% in North America, 26% in Europe, 12% in Asia Pacific and 5% in rest of the world. This represents a 26% increase in North America, 42% increase in Europe, 41% increase in Asia Pacific and 86% in rest of the world.  Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2007 came in at $111.2 million or 34% of revenue, flat as a percent of revenue with the second quarter of 2006. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew at a much lower rate than revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were 28% of revenue versus 31% of revenue in the second quarter of 2006 excluding acquisitions.  Non-operating income for the second quarter of 2007 was $271,000 versus $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. Higher profitability from the CTCT joint venture was offset by higher interest costs related to the debt for the @Road acquisition.  Now looking at the balance sheet, we finished the second quarter of 2007 with $73.8 million in cash compared to $63.6 million in the prior quarter. In the second quarter, net accounts receivable were $235.2 million compared to $216.1 million in the first quarter of 2007. Days sales outstanding this quarter were 56 days, essentially flat with the prior quarter. Inventory was $137.7 million compared to $127.6 million in the first quarter of 2007. Inventory turns were essentially flat at 4.3. Cash flow from operations for the first half of 2007 was $86.5 million, an increase of 46% from the first half of 2006. Our debt level due to the @Road acquisition is at $123 million, down from $170.5 million in the first quarter of 2007.  Turning now to our guidance for the third quarter of 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, Trimble expects revenue to grow 25% to 27% compared to the third quarter of 2006 with revenue between $294 million and $299 million. At a 38% tax rate with approximately 125.1 million shares outstanding, Trimble expects third quarter 2007 GAAP earnings per share between $0.18 and $0.20. Trimble expects third quarter 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.26 and 0.28 compared to actual split-adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 in the third quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of 2007 uses a 38% tax rate and excludes the amortization of intangibles of $10.5 million related to previous acquisitions and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million.  Thank you and we will now take your questions.  Question And Answer 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Bill Benton from William Blair. 
William Benton - William Blair & Company: Hi, afternoon guys. Congratulations on a strong quarter. You didn't give us full year guidance. I know that's because it implies probably the fourth quarter, but is an event should we ignore the current full year guidance out there? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I mean, Bill, if you take our first three quarters and take assumption in fourth quarter, it clearly implies that we will be above the $1.07 to $1.09 guidance that we had given in the previous call. 
William Benton - William Blair & Company: Okay. You don't want to give a full year number, but you just take the old number [ph]. 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: That's right. 
William Benton - William Blair & Company: And then if you could just talk about, obviously, the new products seem to have a particularly notable impact in the ag segment this quarter. I know you've got some new products in survey as well. Could you just talk about some of the new product impacts? If you could give us a little more color around there, then also the health of the channels. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. As far as new products, I think the standout product in the quarter was this EZ-Guide 500 which was the new Lightbar product from agriculture. So that added a lot of boost to ag results in the quarter without a doubt. At the same time, there are other factors at work in ag. The economy, the farm economy is stronger than it's been for some time and there is probably more enthusiasm in the farm economy than there has been maybe ever. Ethanol and others have been contributing factors. At the same time, as our underlying baseline products called the EZ-Steer as well as the Autopilot, the high-end product are also doing very well. So it is actually a multi-faceted play here. But certainly what added luster to the quarter was the EZ-Guide 500. There were a number of new or relatively new products in the quarter, the new scanning Total Station in survey did not have necessarily a material... much of a material impact on the quarter. It's still relatively early days and still is getting in the ramp-up process. GIS products are relatively new and they added some luster to that line this quarter.  But primarily I think the standout was EZ-Guide 500, which due to maybe some special circumstances kind of perversely is that it rained more in early spring this year than it does most year, kept farmers out of the fields. They therefore had more of a tendency to buy things. So there were some special circumstances that may have boosted that. But that's the rough scan on new products.  In terms health of the channel, the channels are strong, nothing really new to report there. The channels are doing well. Do you have a specific point there, Bill? 
William Benton - William Blair & Company: No, I just was curious, I guess, maybe two parts to it, as traditionally your dealers haven't carried much inventory. I presume that hasn't changed. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: That has not changed. 
William Benton - William Blair & Company: Okay. And then also, some of your competitors have been making acquisitions of their other dealers. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. 
William Benton - William Blair & Company: And I am just curious kind of your thoughts and then how that might be impacting the market. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it's really too soon to tell as there has been a tendency in the past 6 to 9 months for the competition, both Leica and Topcon have brought into their distribution. And I would say it has had no material effect or not even a noticeable effect at this point in time. So we'll have to see what the implications of that are. Our strategy in E&C, in GIS and ag is fundamentally remains a third party distribution model. We don't have plans to fundamentally change our strategy there. We'll enhance it as necessary, but fundamentally, our strategy remains intact and centered on third party in those markets. 
William Benton - William Blair & Company: Very good. Well, congrats again. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Benett Notman from Davenport. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: Good afternoon and congratulations on a strong performance. Could you talk a little bit about just the plan, the build out of the Mobile Solutions business, sort of where we should, I guess, view you as focusing your efforts and ay be what milestones we should be looking for over the next couple of quarters as you bring the business all together? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the way we've characterized it is steady as she goes and continued progression. I think the milestones that we established early this year in roughly a two year context was the idea that you should be watching us move towards an operating margin in that segment that's consistent with the rest of Trimble and call it plus or minus say 20% operating margin excluding intangible amortization. So I think what we are aiming for here is a relatively steady progression towards that 20% operating margin number over the next two years. So aside from that, I am not sure that we have put any specific milestones in there. I think the strategy that we have been pursuing from the very beginning in the segment has been a relative affection for vertical markets where we can differentiate ourselves, build a unique value equation, whether it be in retail or direct store delivery, whether it be in public safety, construction supply, construction or others. And I think that @Road gives us a wider canvas on which to play that particular strategic theme. So I think without being overly specific here, I think that 20% operating margin, strong top line growth over the next year and a half is really what we are aiming for here. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: Should the top line growth come more from the penetration of new verticals and the build out sort of within public safety and direct store delivery or is a lot of that going to come from sort of the old @Road type of business, which was kind of bigger fleets, maybe things like utilities and cable TV, that kind of stuff? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the answer in the next 12 to 18 month context is probably both is that the overall market is certainly heavily unpenetrated at this point in time. There is loss of opportunity. @Road has given us a position with larger... with distribution channels that can enable us to deal with larger fleets. We are certainly not opposed to that, but at the same time these vertical plays also are extremely unpenetrated. So I would actually say it would be a balance between the two. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: Thank you. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson from Dougherty & Company. 
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. It's actually Charlie Anderson [ph] for Jeff here. How are you guys doing today? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Fine. 
Unidentified Analyst: Good. I just had a question about Mobile Solutions here again. I was wondering if you guys could break out what was the core there maybe versus @Road. I think you guys did that on the last call, and it was probably getting... and you're putting these together, but I wondered if there is any detail there. 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Well, [ph] I think we have the Mobile Solution numbers and we pointed to the margin improvement sequentially and versus prior quarter. And I would say the non-GAAP operating margins were already 10.8% this quarter versus a single-digit operating margin the quarter before and last year 3.6%. And a large chunk of that is driven by the increasing profitability in @Road. And as Steve pointed out, as you look at progression sequentially, slowly quarter-over-quarter, you should see increase towards a 20% margin over the next two years, and that would give a sense of... @Road is the biggest revenue generator in this whole segment at this point, and improvement in @Road over time will reflect on the total Mobile Solutions segment margins. 
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then just a housekeeping question here. Can you say again what the mix was for North America revenue? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, on North America revenue, the regional spilt... let me just get my notes out so I can give you precise numbers... was 57% in North America, 26% in Europe, 12% in Asia Pacific and 5% in rest of the world. And this was a 26% increase in North America over last year, 42% increase in Europe, 41% in Asia Pacific and 86% in rest of the world. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then just a follow-up question on that. Steve, you talked about the trends being a little bit downward in North America right now, but you sort of called it a recalibration. Just kind of curious what your sense is of and how you guys are planning for how long might take before you see that on the upswing again. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so first of all, that comment specific to survey instruments, not for any of the other markets. 
Unidentified Analyst: Sure. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: And I think there is certainly... this is something fundamentally different than what we saw in 2001 in the first part of 2002, which was, what I would call, kind of a structural realignment. I think that survey instruments had a couple of very strong and relatively hot years. I think probably some of the effect is the residential, call it the third order or second order and third order, effects of the residential having floated through a bit. But the key drivers of heavy highway and commercial still are very strong. So I think our sense in a subject... we are watching and I think our sense is that there maybe two or three quarters here of what I will call taking a breath. But I would say is that with what we can see is 2008 what we'll see is, let's call it, a recovery maybe to kind of something more like former standards. So this is not widespread; it's pockets. We actually have remedies for a number of these pockets. So I think at this point in time, we are not looking at as widespread or necessarily structural, certainly not competitive. So I think that we work our way through it, and we are not looking forward to be particularly longstanding. Conditions will prove themselves out, but I think it's more of a, let's call it, the market taking a deep breath. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's very encouraging. Thank you so much guys. 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Spinola with Needham & Company. 
Andrew Spinola - Needham & Company: Steve, just to follow on that previous question, when you were talking about survey previously, you said that there is no change to your longer term. Could you just maybe elaborate on that, penetration, growth rates, geographic? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So keeping it specific to the U.S. is we still view the market for, let's call it, the key Trimble technologies, GPS and call it the more Robotic, Optical, Total Stations and such for survey. We still view those markets as being well less than 50% penetrated. Probably the penetration rates across the U.S. are 30% to 40% at this point in time, which means we have plenty of market left to conquer before we start to talk about product replacement cycles or saturation issues and such. So I think the key drivers are still there, productivity is still a key element in this. So I think that our view on the long term remains absolutely unchanged and I think we should be able to produce strong double-digit growth in this marketplace in the U.S. for us as far out as we can reasonably look. The interesting phenomenon reflected by some of those percentage growth numbers that Raj talked about is that in survey instruments at this point in time is we are now seeing the U.S. market as being a minority of the total. So the U.S. market in survey instruments is now less than 50% of the total sales in survey instruments by a fair degree. But, so the... this is becoming an international market very rapidly. But again, the key drivers are still in place in the U.S. So I think that over the next couple of years, we have no issues in terms of looking to the growth. 
Andrew Spinola - Needham & Company: Okay. On capital allocation, would which you say excluding acquisitions, you would look to pay down the debt as fast as you can so that you can start working towards --? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I mean if you look at our debt pay down, it's been significant in the first half of the year. But besides @Road, we just had one small acquisition. And our priority over the next six months is we are looking... we will be doing small acquisitions over the next six months and our priority would be to buy those companies. Any excess that's left over will pay -- we'll use it to pay down the debt. 
Andrew Spinola - Needham & Company: Okay. And then just last question on the... you gave rest of world revenue as 5% of total. I have it as 11% in the first quarter, 9% in 2Q '06. It looks like that... is that number... has there been a change in the classification or anything like that? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. It's a little bit of apples to oranges comparison. @Road has added... well, if you look at versus last year, we didn't have @Road. So @Road is primarily a U.S. business. They have some revenue in Australia and revenue in UK, but it's primarily dominated by U.S. So the U.S., the North American portion has increased because of inclusion of @Road and the rest of the buy has shrunk somewhat. 
Andrew Spinola - Needham & Company: Okay. Thanks a lot. 
Operator: You next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Thank you. A few questions. Raj, you are approximating 20% operating margins on a pro forma basis in the first half of this year. Have you talked about a long-term operating model? If not, can you directionally sort of give us a sense of where you think this business is heading? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Our long-term operating net model, Jeff, is that... I'm sorry, Paul, our long-term operating model is that every incremental dollar of revenue that we sell, 20% to 25% of that should fall to the bottom line, which equates to roughly 100 basis points improvement to the prior year operating margin number. So that's the operating model that we are shooting for going forward. Now we have driven historically better results than that, but at this point we feel that 100 basis points is what we are shooting for. 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Okay. '08 tax rate, should we also expect 38% next year? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Okay. The last conference call, Steve, you talked about the contiguous growth opportunities that you see. Can give us an update on those strategic initiatives? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I take it you are referring to this concept of adjacency? 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Yes. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Yes, so I think that being an applications-focused company, that is where we see most of the growth for the company coming from is from penetrating our existing market, but then looking for adjacencies. And I think that that continues. I am not sure I've got any good examples to use in the last quarter of anything new in that regard. But I'll use the... as an example, it may not be a perfect example, but the scanning Total Station that came out in the first quarter, that was introduced in the first quarter, which represents an instrument at a new price point, really seeking out a different market, satisfying a different need, somewhere between total laser scanning and conventional total station surveying. So the unit is targeted at roughly about a $70,000 price point, which is higher than a Total Station, but lower than, classic laser scanning. So I would call that a crude adjacency. I think we could come up with more elegant examples than that, but essentially an unmet need close by... to the market that we are already satisfying. And we took an existing platform, modified it and brought it to effectively a new application and really a new customer set. So that's the sort of thing that we hope to do on a daily basis. 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: As you do that, do you believe that you have the channels necessary to do that or are you going to have to buy your way or rent your way into new channels? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: The attraction and the... the attraction of this particular view on adjacency is that effectively, you don't have to kind of reinvent yourselves in a big way. We don't have to create step functions; we can do things in a lot of relatively small steps. So in this case, the channels already existed. It was simply to take this new capability, put it into existing channels and do some training, do some market positioning, if you will. But it was all incremental, existing product platform, existing channel. So essentially at the increment, a relatively rich margin mix. Now the concept of adjacency could also be applied in a different context, which is we have an existing product capability and we go look for a new market, we go look for a new group of customers. That would require some new channel development, and that has happened. But generally, the attraction of the adjacency is you don't have to reinvent yourself on a major step, step functions to go looking for these new markets and you certainly don't have to at the company. 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Okay, last question. The acquisitions that you have in mind in the next six months, are they technology tuck-ins or are you acquiring market? Can you just give us some sense of what we should expect? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll avoid that particular question and answer a safe question, which is what we've talked about in terms of our overall acquisition strategy is to meet specific needs. We do not make acquisitions to acquire revenues, we are not attempting to build or revenue by acquisitions. But what we are trying to do is accomplish a number of strategic objectives. For example, creating a beachhead in a new marketplace. So you look at Eleven and MobileTech acquisitions, those got us into a direct store delivery, you look at Advanced Public Safety and Visual Statement, and those got us into public safety. So there is that strategic rationale. And then another case is to make an acquisition to establish... to fill in a product or a technology gap. So when we acquired MEPSE [ph], that got us into laser scanning and there are other examples like that. So I would say whatever we do, we'll fall into those realm, you will not see us taking departures into new, totally new unexplored territory. And probably, most likely, the acquisitions will be in our traditional mode of being relatively small to medium-size, but largely to establish these beachheads or to fill in gaps. 
Paul Coster - JP Morgan: Great. Thank you very much. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Benett Notman with Davenport. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: Yes, in your opening comments, you talked about sort of the growth of software and deferred revenue in the business model. I am just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where that's coming in and sort of how that fits into the strategy of coming here? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me talk to software and services in a general sense as probably the strategy, and maybe how Raj can talk about kind of deferred revenue as a piece in this whole thing. But certainly, if you look at our acquisitions over the last several years, they have been largely software-oriented operations. Sometimes discrete standalone software solutions, sometimes bundled with hardware, so... or have had a strong services component. Certainly @Road had a strong services component. So what we see is that we view... do not view ourselves as a product company; we view ourselves as a solutions company, increasingly to be a solutions company. To actually in an application set to provide a solution for a class of users, it's necessary to provide both hardware but also software and then increasingly services. And in pursuit of that solutions definition, we have viewed ourselves increasingly as more of a software and services company as well as being a hardware company. So it's something that we have been consciously doing. It is something we will continue to do. And from a financial standpoint, the fall off there is that a well run software company or well run services company is typically going to attract higher gross margins; and if it's well run will ultimately lead to higher operating margins. So we also viewed it from a financial standpoint as an opportunity to potentially expand our operating margins a bit more. Raj, why don't you talk deferred revenue? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So if you look at our deferred revenue, Benett, end of this year, our deferred revenue balance was around $28 million, and between long term and short term. And if you look at our Q2 ending balance, we were at $51 million. So you have seen a significant increase in our deferred revenue on the balance sheet. There are three main reasons for it. One is the subscription model, the @Road acquisition we have done. As you sell hardware and the hardware is all installed, but you recognize revenue over the term of the contract. So it gets recognized for approximately three years. So the good news is that there is a stream of revenue that has to be recognized in the future and kind of an annuity kind of a phenomenon.  The second reason is, as Steve has mentioned, we are becoming... we have brought some software companies as well as the software content in our products has been increasing. And what happens is when you recognize revenue under the software rules, if there is some functionality, you may promised... you may deliver 80% of the functionality, but some of the functionality has not been delivered, you defer the revenue till all the functionality is delivered, even though you may have been actually paid for that revenue.  And the third reason for increase in the deferred revenue is that we have been wining some big contracts like the Marine contract of $8 million plus that we announced in E&C. And again since it is delivered over a multiple period of time and typically you have to, typically, not always, but typically you to wait till you deliver the final delivery and then you get to recognize that revenue. So we have... so the good news is that this revenue will be coming back to us in the future we have built a significant amount of deferred revenue. The only flip side of it is that it makes... depending upon how you recognize revenue, it some times may cause some fluctuations in some quarters depending upon if you can or you cannot recognize that revenue. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: Okay, great. And then could you talk a little bit about the Advanced Devices business and which end markets exactly are driving the growth in embedded components and sort of what we should be monitoring there for end markets? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So the embedded business, well, let me state that what's driving the growth is not automotive at this point in time; it's a much wider market. So it's what we are selling here is GPS functionality, typically board level, printed circuit board level functionality to anyone how needs GPS functionality. So it's actually a fairly diverse group widely based, but a lot of it asset tracking and that sort of thing, which is what's driving the growth at this point in time. But it used to be a more automotive; it's shifted, it's now mostly non-automotive that's the underlying driver here. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: And then given the success you've had with the Nokia relationship and how that's contributed to margin, is there any more technology licensing in the future for that business unit? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's something we are interested in. I think it would... I would be misspeaking if I were to indicate that we expect any head turning sorts of deals coming up. But I think it's always operative in the background, but I wouldn't be projecting anything significant anytime soon. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: Right. And then last question from me, could you just talk about the Connected Construction Site concept and sort of where you are and are you productizing that? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. So again, this is not a phenomenon that we are going to see happen on any given day. It's progressive. So again, I think that we are productizing at the place that is most evident is in our, what we are calling, our construction services division, which is bringing a product to market and upgrading all the time. But the product is called Trimble Construction Manager which is performing a number of things including asset management but also monitoring the condition of the site. So largely, at this point in time, the most visible reflection of a Connected Construction Site is in that product. As we get closer to the end of the year, I would expect that at our users conference in Dimensions in November is we'll have more specific things to say and to show about the Connected Construction Site. But again, it's a progressive thing, there is not going to be any given quarter where the world suddenly changes. But what we are doing is building more and more functionality into this software program, we are building more and more functionality into other Trimble hardware platforms to make them all work better together and connect them and come up with better solutions.  But ultimately, I think the relative vision here that may be closer than anyone understands is looking, for example, at the site foreman, the site superintendent, the person responsible for managing a large construction site. Today, that individual, find out what's going on, gets in a pick-up truck, drives around and does visual inspection and has conversations with people and then goes back to the trailer which is full of paper. The vision, if you will, for some point in future is for that individual to basically be able to sit in that trailer, look at a computer screen, be able to see where every piece of equipment and really every value add activity on that construction site, be able to see it on the computer screen, potentially click on a machine, understand the productivity of that machine to date, potentially be able to look at the deliveries that are supposed to be made that afternoon in terms of concrete trucks and stuff and make sure that they are on track, click on another screen and find out what the weather is going to be that afternoon in case there is a weather-sensitive operation that's going to occur. So that is the relative sort of vision we are talking about. A lot of those pieces where functionality exist and what we need to do now is to get those more effectively in the marketplace. So again, a progressive thing, but there is actually quite a bit that's already occuring. 
Benett Notman - Davenport & Company, LLC: Great, thank you. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Good afternoon. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Eli. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: A couple of just quick questions. On foreign currency, can you tell us about the impact on top line, bottom line sectors? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So as you know, U.S. dollar weakened against most of the foreign currencies like the euro. So it definitely... it had an impact, favorable impact on our revenue. We have gained around 1 to 2 points of growth because of that. And on the bottom line, we are naturally hedged. So we do sell revenue, but we also have a lot of expenses in countries like Sweden, a lot of R&D expenses, countries like New Zealand. And it hurts us from an operating expense point of view. So we are naturally, will close to naturally hedged from a bottom line perspective. So we had a very minimal impact on the operating income line. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. Going forward, I guess you gave us $10.5 million intangibles and $4.5 million of stock expense. Is that the new run rate for the quarter for the next few quarters at least? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, that's really close. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: And actually one more, we should annualize that for 2008? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: That's correct. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. And then... interest, besides [ph] you are paying down interest, your debt, do you have any target level you would like to see get at the end of the year or what can we assume the charges will look like for the next couple of quarters? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So, yes, so our debt right now is $120 million. And if you assume kind of the worst case scenario, at $120 million at 6% interest rate and just cut it by half, that would be a little bit of a conservative estimate for the back half of the year as far as interest rate is concerned, because we would certainly earn some interest income on our cash balance as well, so there will be some offset there. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: So I mean, that's assuming that the 120 stayed there, it will it be a -- 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Depending on our acquisition strategy, it may or may not come down on that. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Now as far as... as you look at various sector operations, is the Nokia income going to also disappear in the fourth quarter, I think as it did last year? I can't remember [ph], but --? 
Rajat Bahri - Chief Financial Officer: So we started getting Nokia income in the third quarter of last year and it's a long-term, long, long-term contract and we get paid for it every quarter. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: So that would be every quarter. Should we expect a normal seasonality in the E&C business here in the second half as you would [ph] historically during the first half? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, certainly, I think traditional seasonality more or less is going to be what you are going to see. So you should anticipate that from an E&C perspective, that the second quarter was the seasonally strong quarter of the year and that the third and fourth quarters should reflect the traditional pattern among the quarters. So nothing has changed there. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Okay. And as far as the ag business being so strong, are we going to be able to see much stronger Field Solutions because that is going [ph] into at least the third quarter this year in the third quarter and higher margins than we normally have seen before in that sector? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So I think that you are going to see the... ag is going to continue to be strong in our view for the rest of the year. I think you have to be real careful there because that is a very seasonal business. And typically, we hit... probably hit stronger in the second quarter because of things like the rainfall than would have been natural. But I would say that with a certain amount of care and caution, you should expect to see stronger ag in not only the second half of the year, but very much seasonally challenged, if you will. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: So expect the margin... we had very strong margins in the first half in Field Solutions than we did last year. Should we expect them to seasonally weaken, but probably not as much as they weakened last year, that would be a fair comment? 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think that you have to do the arithmetic, but that would be a... you are going to see some scale effect because our cost structure in many respects is constant throughout the year. So yes, you will see some seasonal fall off probably. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Well, thank you. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet. Thanks. 
Operator: There are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Berglund. 
Steven W. Berglund - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thanks for attending. We'll talk to you next quarter. Bye. 
Operator: This concludes today's second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :
Steve Berglund: Good afternoon. First quarter performance, besides reflecting continuing strong financial performance, represented an important symbolic milestone for Trimble. For the first time, trailing 12 months’ revenue exceeded the $1 billion level. The extra digit may be only symbolic, but it does represent a natural point of introspection to consider the behaviors and strategies back at Trimble here, and to identify the behaviors that will be necessary to sustain momentum into a challenging future.  Since 1999, which represents the point of origin for much of the management group, Trimble has generated a compound revenue growth rate of 19% per year, and more importantly has increased non-GAAP operating margins from 7.5% in fiscal 1999 to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2007.  During that time we've grown from less than 1000 employees to more than 3,400 employees and from a narrow geographic focus to a global enterprise with development, manufacturing and sales facilities in approximately 50 locations in twenty countries.  Baseline first quarter performance across all of Trimble segments reflected progression on both the top and bottom lines. Total revenue before @Road grew by 22% over the first quarter of 2006 and with @Road grew by 27%. Non-GAAP operating margins reflected an improvement of 2.3 points over the first quarter of 2006 on the strength of operating leverage of 28% which would have been higher without the impact of @Road.  The Engineering and Construction business continues to perform well with some changes in the mix of the business. Aside from the residential construction slowdown in the U.S. which has not had a material impact on our overall results, the construction market continues to be strong worldwide. Our Survey Instruments business has seen particularly strong growth internationally which has offset some pockets of slower growth in the U.S.  One example of the faster international growth is in Europe, which a few years ago, was a relatively under-represented market for Trimble Survey Instruments and a strategic lay guard to the U.S. With the combination of improved economic growth and solid managerial execution, we have grown our European sales faster in both the European survey instruments market and our U.S. sales. As a result we have taken share in Europe and survey sales are approaching parity with our U.S. survey sales.  This performance is reflective of our experience in other international markets including China, India, South Africa and the Middle East.  The Field Solutions segment demonstrated strong performance in the quarter with particularly strong performance from agriculture. The improving outlook for agriculture is primarily a result of an improved farm economy in North America, a strong Trimble product portfolio, aggressive marketing actions, and accelerating international growth. The other business in the segment, Geographic Information Systems is also demonstrating underlying growth, although was camouflaged in the first quarter by an unusually large first quarter in 2006.  The Advanced Devices segment also demonstrated significant growth in the quarter with the components business reflecting continuing strong demand for non-automotive applications. In addition, we are seeing an improved revenue ramp per contract.  The Mobile Solutions segment continues its progression. We currently have four business elements within the segment, each with its own story. The original business element was the segment as it was constituted in 2005, before the acquisitions of the last 18 months. This business is centered on the ready mix concrete market. It lost money through the third quarter of 2005, and has been profitable for the last 6 quarters with recurring revenues increasing, and a double-digit growth rate, resulting in steadily improving margins.  The second business element is public safety, which was created out of the acquisitions of Advanced Public Safety and Visual Statement. During 2005 and early 2006 this business is producing double-digit revenue growth rates and is expected to generate double-digit operating margins for the year.  Our third business is Direct Store Delivery or DSD which was created through the acquisitions of Eleven Technology and MobileTech. This business is requiring some patience till it achieves its targeted performance.  While we continue to like the potential and dynamics of the DSD market, we need to accomplish two tasks to establish a basis for financial performance, more consistent with Trimble as a whole. The first task is to perform on a number of pre-acquisition contracts which are requiring more work and more time than we contemplated at the point of their acquisition, and therefore not yet profitable.  The second task is to accelerate the pace of innovation in the DSD market and to deliver higher software functionality beyond what is currently available as a way to further energize the market. Once these tasks are complete, we should see a stepped function of profitability in the DSD business in 2008.  The fourth business within the Mobile Solution segment is @Road, which we acquired two and half months ago. Since then, we have taken a number of steps to establish the basis for improved long-term performance. The transition is proceeding and they are pleased with our progress today.  The first step is then the restructuring of the company consistent with Trimble's divisional philosophy. There are now a number of divisions within @Road, each with a market focus and accountability for our P&L. This organizational and cultural realignment is fundamental to intelligently managing revenue growth and progressing towards operating margins above 20%.  The second step has been the appointment of a new senior management group within @Road. With just a couple of exceptions, this group was promoted from within @Road and as a result continuity has been preserved during a time significant change. Overall, we have managed through the early days of the acquisition without any meaningful organizational disruption.  The third step has been a new 2008 budget, consistent with our pre-acquisitions first year financial model. The budgetary emphasis has been on improving @Road's operating leverage.  The fourth step has been the identification of cost efficiencies, synergies and business practices needed to achieve the long-term financial model with accompanying action plans. As we have said in previous calls, the overall level of re-engineering needed is relatively small.  Overall, we have not discovered any significant surprises within that growth. We expect to see continual improvement and profitability during 2007 with significant profitability improvement in 2008. There are a number of reasons why the financial improvements will be progressive as opposed to dramatic.  The first is the mechanical effect of working through the impact of acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. The second is that we will continue to incur significant development cost through 2007 that are associated with a number of large contracts that have been taken in the last year with no significant short-term revenue. The third is that it will be 2008 before we see the full effects of a number of the programs to achieve the efficiencies and synergies that are being put in place in 2007.  Now, that Trimble is at a billion dollar revenue rate, we have new advantages of scale which enables us to be more aggressive and expansive. On the other hand, we face challenges of complexity, transparency and control.  In engaging in some level of introspection and how to maintain or increase our momentum, we are balancing the need to reinforce the past settlements that will continue to work for us, to eliminate ineffective behaviors that are no longer appropriate and to add new scales and behaviors that will enable us to become more effective.  Examples of the elements to be reinforced to meet the challenges will include, becoming even more aggressive internationally in mentality strategy and in an execution, expanding the frontiers of what our total commitment for solving the customer's problem means and practice, achieving greater financial and operational transparency in order to continue to refine our divisional organizational model; effectively coupling a wide array of technologies and capabilities with a large number of markets, and supporting and developing our managers and employees to enable them to be the key differentiator relative to our competition.  This is just the slice of the extended width. These internally generated demands to do better are triggered by our belief that we have an extended list of on net needs in the marketplace that can continue to fuel an aggressive growth trajectory. We are not ideas constrained, and our intention is not to allow internal constraints to stand in our way of realizing the potential.  In the meantime, we have all segments performing well, with an outlook for 2007 that is substantially unchanged and that remains positive.  Let me turn the call over to Raj. 
Rajat Bahri: Good afternoon. As a reminder, we completed a 2:1 stock split on February 23rd, 2007, so all 2006 numbers have been split adjusted. First quarter 2007 revenue was $285.7 million, up 27% year-over-year. Excluding @Road, revenue was $274.5 million, up 22%.  GAAP earnings per share were $0.24, up from $0.22 in the first quarter of 2006. We are looking at year-over-year comparisons, it should be noted that the first quarter 2007 GAAP earnings were impacted by $0.05 per share due to higher amortization of purchase intangibles and purchase in-process research and development expense, and by $0.02 due to restructuring expense as a result of acquisitions.  Additionally, first quarter 2007 GAAP earnings were impacted by $0.02 due to the impact of FAS 123R. Adjusting for these expenses, non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.33, up 27% over the first quarter of 2006. While the tax rate for the first quarter of 2007 was 32% due to a one-time reversal of the valuation allowance for research and development credit, we expect a full-year tax rate of 37% to 38% versus regular guidance of 35% to 37%.  We have been working on long-term tax planning strategies that we expect will get us to a tax rate of 34% to 35% by 2009.  Operating income for the quarter was $39.3 million, up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2006. Operating income was impacted by an increase in amortization of purchase intangibles, and purchase in-process research and development expense of $7.7 million over the first quarter of 2006 due to acquisitions. Additionally, restructuring expense of $2.7 million was also due to acquisitions. Adjusting for these two factors, non-GAAP operating income was $55.3 million in the first quarter of 2007, up 43% from the first quarter of 2006.  Operating income margins for the first quarter was 13.7%, down slightly from 14.6% in the first quarter of 2006. Again, adjusting for the factor as mentioned earlier, non-GAAP operating income margins for the quarter were 19.4%, for up about 200 basis points compared to 17.1% in the first quarter of 2006.  Now, I will discuss the results by segments.  Engineering and Construction revenue for the first quarter of 2007 was $175.6 million, up 20% over the first quarter of 2006, driven primarily by sales of construction products, including machine controls and strong international growth. Operating income for the first quarter of 2007 in E&C was $42.2 million or 24% of revenue compared to $26.4 million or 18% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006.  Margin improvement was driven by the mix of products in construction and by operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2007 in E&C was $43 million or 24.5% of revenue compared to $27.4 million or 18.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006.  Trimble Field Solutions revenue in the first quarter of the 2007 was $51 million, up 18% from the prior year, due to a strengthening agricultural market and the introduction of the EZ-Guide 500. TFS operating income for the first quarter of 2007 was $16.6 million or 32.6% of revenue, compared to $13.9 million or 32.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006.  TFS non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2007 was $16.8 million or 33% of revenue for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $14.2 million or 32.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006. Revenue for Trimble Mobile Solutions in the first quarter 2007 was $29.9 million up 137% from revenue of $12.6 million in the first quarter of 2006. $11.3 million of this revenue came from acquisition of @Road which closed on February 16, 2007.  TMS operating income was $1 million or 3.4 % of revenue for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $223,000 or 1.8 % of revenue in the first quarter of 2006. Margin improvement was due to an increased subscriber base. TMS non-GAAP operating income was $1.8 million or 5.9% of revenue for the first quarter of 2007, compared to $399,000 or 3.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006.  Additionally, I am happy to report that @Road had a small profit in the last six weeks of the first quarter of 2007 versus a loss in the first quarter of last year.  Advanced Devices revenue for the first quarter was $29.3 million, up 25% year-over-year, driven by embedded product sales. Advanced Devices operating income was $3.3 million or 11.4% of revenue for the first quarter of 2007, compared to $2.3 million or 9.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006.  Advanced Devices non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 million or 12.6% of revenue for the first quarter of 2007, compared to $2.8 million or 12% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006. The margin improvement was driven by higher sales and the Nokia royalty payments.  For the overall company, gross margins for the first quarter of 2007 was 50.1%, with non-GAAP gross margin of 51.5%, compared to 47.6% and non-GAAP gross margins of 48.1% in the first quarter of 2006. The significant expansion came from acquisition of several software and subscription based business models and mix of our products.  Geographically in the first quarter, overall company revenue increased year-over-year by 19% in North America, 34% in Europe, 29% in Asia Pacific and 46% in the rest of the world.  Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2007 came in at $103.9 million or 36% of revenue, compared to 33% of revenue in the first quarter of 2006. Operating expenses for the quarter included $4.1 million from amortization of purchased intangibles, $2.1 million for in-process R&D expense, and $2.7 million in restructuring charges that resulted from acquisitions, as well as $3 million impact from stock-based compensation.  Excluding these impacts, first quarter operating expenses were 32% of revenue versus 31% in the first quarter of last year. In this quarter, we had an operating leverage of 28%.  Non-operating income for the first quarter of 2007 was $2.9 million versus $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2006. Higher interest costs were offset by higher profitability from the CTCT joint venture.  For the first quarter of 2007 GAAP net income was $28.7 million, and earnings per share were $0.24, up $0.02 when compared to the first quarter of 2006. Earnings per share in the first quarter of 2007 were impacted by approximately $0.05 due to higher amortization of intangibles and in-process R&D, by 2 cents due to restructuring charges and by $0.02 due to the impact of FAS 123R.  Non-GAAP net income and earnings per share for the quarter were $39.6 million and $0.33, up 33% and 27% respectively over the first quarter of 2006.  Looking at the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $63.6 million in cash compared to $129.6 million in the prior quarter.  In the first quarter, net accounts receivable were $216.1 million, compared to $172 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase was driven by inclusion of @Road and higher sales.  Days sales outstanding improved to 54 days compared to 55 days in the prior quarter. Inventory was $127.6 million compared to $112.6 million in the third quarter of 2007. The increase was driven primarily due to the inclusion of @Road. Terms improved to 4.2 for this period compared to 4.1 in the prior quarter.  Our debt level as a result of @Road acquisition is $170 million versus our original forecast of $270 million. The lower debt was due to better cash flow from operations and less acquisition activities than anticipated.  Now, I'll give you GAAP guidance for the second quarter of 2007, including the impact of @Road. In the second quarter of 2007, Trimble expects revenue to grow 26% to 28% compared to second quarter of 2006, with revenue between $308 million and $330 million. At 39% tax rate with approximately 124.6 million shares outstanding, we expect second quarter 2007 GAAP earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.24.  Trimble expects non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.29 and $0.31 compared to actual split-adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29 in the second quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of 2007 uses a 39% tax rate and excludes the amortization of intangibles of $10.7 million related to previous acquisitions, and anticipated impact of stock-based compensation expense of $3.9 million.  As we guided on our fourth quarter 2006 earnings call, revenue for 2007 is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.17 billion, with $80 million to $85 million of revenue coming from @Road.  On a GAAP basis, Trimble expects 2007 earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.80. Trimble is raising its previously announced split-adjusted, non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for 2007 by $0.02 to $1.07 to $1.09, due to a lower debt level than originally guided, partially offset by a higher tax rate.  Non-GAAP guidance for 2007 excludes an estimated $38.9 million impact from an amortization of intangibles, a $2.1 million impact from in-process research and development expense, a $2.7 million impact from restructuring expense, and a 14.8 million impact from stock based compensation expense.  We will now take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Amit Kapur from Piper Jaffray. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Great, thanks a lot guys. I was wondering if you could talk a little about how the integration of @Road is going and in particular -- you talked after the acquisition about having two platforms. I think you trying to migrate on one, how is that migration coming along? 
Steve Berglund: Sure. So, first of all, let me characterize the transition as going well overall. As I pointed out in the scripted remarks, we've done a number of things, all of those have gone pretty much as we expected to go and we haven’t seen any early disruption. So, in terms of product rationalization in all that, I don’t want to say too much, I'd just assume to keep some competitive secrets here, but lets just say that we have the old PMS bunch with combined with the @Road people and I think there what we do see is a whole lot of potential both at hardware level and the software level to lets say rationalize platforms both in terms of a simpler, a more compact set of offerings. Again both hardware and software, but also in terms of being able to put together capabilities in creating new product offering. So, I am going to be less than specific on it, and I not giving a timetable, but let's just say is that as we march through 2007 I think that will bring to you, I have more and more to show in that recurrent on it. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Sure. And maybe turning to some of the international markets that you talked about, are any geographies kind of standing out in your mind or you are just seeing kind of across the board strengthen in a lot of international markets? 
Steve Berglund: If I would point at one -- first of all, I think those geographies which actually embraces much of the world outside the North America, they are all strong and we are seeing very strong growth in most of them, but I would say is if I were to point more specifically at one over the other, it would be the Middle East. The Middle East for us is a very good market at this point in time, and starting from a lower base but in terms of percentage growth is very good at this point. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Starting from a lower businges, but in term so percentage growth is very good at this point. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Okay. We have one last question before turning it over. If we kind of look at the mix of international versus domestic sales trending throughout 2007, how should we expect that mix to trend? 
Steve Berglund: Again, lots of moving parts here with the acquisition of @Road, our relative the U.S. content has gone back up, just doesn't matter if I worth in the text so, I am not sure I am if able to make a call in terms of percentage split, but I would say at this point in time as we indicated in the script is that right now the international markets are growing faster than the U.S. So, if we can establish the right baseline, I would expect to see international sales go up relative during 2007, but I am not able to make a call in terms of how much of a move that may be at this point. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. 
Steve Berglund:
Operator: Our next question comes from the Bill Benton, from William Blair 
Bill Benton - William Blair: Good afternoon, guys. Quickly on the international question, again, obviously we saw an (inaudible) comparisons of the category here but obviously there was a dichotomy in your domestic versus international results, specifically with your E&T segment, are you seeing any of those same dichotomies? I got the sense that you talked about some pockets of weakness domestically, but I didn't know if there was any that were significant? 
Steve Berglund: Sure. First of all, you are right, that's not the comparison we would instantly point to but relative to Caterpillar some similarities, but again the correlation isn't necessarily all that strong. So, the way we characterize it is -- while, the way we characterized within the script carefully was that worldwide construction growth remains strong and that does include the U.S. We saw a significant construction growth in the U.S. in the quarter. That looks relatively robust after making the necessary qualification that we've been making for the last few quarters relative to residential.  On surveying instruments, there were some, what I would call pockets, where there was some slower growth, and but not anything that I would paint of as seeing an overall picture at this point in time, it was pretty much regional and in some product categories but nothing all that significant. So, I don't think there is any great pattern that's emerging yet anyway out of the U.S. for us. The construction remains strong overall including the U.S. and surveying instruments are -- have some pockets there. But then international, I guess we've said is pretty much consistent across the worlds across the world. 
Bill Benton - William Blair: Okay. And then, before I think you had talked about Germany and Japan coming on strong, I know you this time you mentioned kind of the Middle East, I don’t know if you can kind of update us on may be some of the trends within the moderate -- in some of those market? 
Steve Berglund: Sure. Europe is, again, showing signs of life, including Germany. I think the fundamentals in Germany. I think Eastern Europe is, again starting from a low base are continuing to improve. I think Eastern Europe is again starting from a low base, looking farther into the future. Eastern Europe and Russia, I think are particularly noteworthy in Europe, but pretty much across Europe we are seeing relative strength. Again, there are pockets in Europe that are not doing as well as others. But, across Europe, but in particular, I think Germany is showing signs of life and than Eastern Europe and Russia are in particular kind of hot spots at this point. And then, again, pretty much across the rest of the world, South Africa and Middle East, China, India. India is starting for a low base, but beginning to catch on. So, generally a pretty robust picture internationally. 
Bill Benton - William Blair: Okay. Can you talk for any, I guess, insight into, is your operating profitability better from your international sales or is it pretty comparable? 
Steve Berglund: I basically avoid the question and say it's roughly comparable. You wouldn't find major differences internationally, but I don't want to give too much competitive insight here. So, I'll just characterize it as not being necessarily a major swing factor in terms of where sales are coming from. 
Bill Benton - William Blair: Okay. And then I was wondering, last question, if Raj could provide any insights in terms of the restructuring charge what that may specifically be related to? 
Rajat Bahri: It is specifically related to @Road. 
Bill Benton - William Blair: Okay. And was it headcount reductions or anything specific there? 
Rajat Bahri: Yes. So there were two portions of restructuring, one was in our balance sheet on purchase price accounting and other one hit the expenses of 2.7. So, it primarily had to do with the people going away and their severance packages and their change of control provisions. 
Bill Benton - William Blair: Okay. Great, guys. Thanks a lot. 
Rajat Bahri: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Evanson with Dougherty & Company. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I think you guys are being too coy about your impressive operating margins in E&C. These are astounding numbers for Q1. Could you talk a little bit about how much of that came from mixed shift, and how much was just pure leverage? 
Steve Berglund: I will let maybe Raj give a more precise answer. But, I guess we can afford to be coy if you are being that robust, Jeff. But, I think it's probably a combination of things. It was certainly some product mix considerations.  Again, as our software content in the product increases there is natural buoyancy in gross margins. They may not, per se, detectible from quarter-to-quarter, but, essentially we are overall creating a richer product mix over time by adding more and more software content.  So, for example, adding Meridian to the mix with an inherently higher gross margin is going to tend to lift it even though it's a fairly small portion of the pie at this point. I think, certainly, we keep continual emphasis on operating leverage, so we're always working very consciously and diligently to make sure that revenues are growing faster than the fundamental core cost base, and I think that was true in the first quarter as well.  So, I wouldn't necessarily point at any one thing that accounts for the improvement in operating margins in E&C. I would say that it is actually a number of things working together, but all time back to what I would call fundamental set of values. Raj, do you have anything to add? 
Rajat Bahri: The only thing I would add is the new products that we have been introducing in the last couple of years like Trimble S6 or the Spatial Stations are in construction area. They all tend to be higher margin products than the base business, and that clearly has -- as those products have been successful, that has expanded our gross margins quite a bit. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: So, with a lead in like that, you got to assume I have a follow-up question with a double edged sword in it. Given, Q2 E&C operating margins, the worst sequential improvement you had historically has been about 350 basis points. Yet your Q2 guidance suggest about flat E&C operating margins. Are you just being conservative on the Q2 guidance or is you are something more to what you are telling us there? 
Rajat Bahri: Well, we believe in Q1, our mix was unusually good in terms of mix of our products. In other words there are high margin products that were particularly successful. And we are assuming a more normal level of mix in Q2. And that won’t be in our favor in Q1, will not to that extent in Q2. So hence we are not building that kind of a product mix in Q2. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: So, for example, possibly you had an $8 million sale of training software to the military, did that happen in Q1? And what was the profitability beyond a product like that? 
Steve Berglund: We are going to ignore the second aspect of the question, and let's just say that I don't think any of that was recognized in the first quarter. And I think the revenue on the order that you are talking about will be recognized over actually a number of quarters, so it won't have any particular impact on closed sense. So, it will play out over a number of quarters. So, just in terms of the revenue recognition. So, I would say that is not an impact either in the first quarter or necessarily a major impact on the second quarter. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Steve Berglund: Sure. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Coster from J.P. Morgan. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Thanks, good afternoon. Raj, give me a free pass as being new to the stock here, but the guidance for the full year is just a little bit hard to work with at the moment. The first quarter is great, the second quarter looks to be growth over prior year or at least flat with it, but then the full year guidance suggests that the second half pro-forma earnings are going to be lower than this time last year. Why would that be or have I misinterpreted your guidance? 
Rajat Bahri: Well, I mean our guidance, Paul, couple of things on the guidance. We actually have raised the full year guidance versus our last guidance based on primarily the lower interest expense that we are experiencing. What we experienced in Q1 is still early to exceed, its going be sustainable for the full year. So we are not calling out as an upside right now to the full year, because we are still in the month of April. And the second part is in the back half we do get impacted by some dilution impacts from @Road, and some tax rate impacts year-over-year that work against us in the back half of the year. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: But what of the dilution impacts? 
Rajat Bahri: Dilution impacts, at this point, when we guided again the year, earlier on we had said there will be a $0.10 dilution on @Road. At this point, we believe that dilution would be around $0.06 to $0.07. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: I don't understand why it would not be affecting the second quarter as well then? 
Rajat Bahri: It is impacting second quarter as well. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Well, the takeaway from me is it's just very, very conservative full year guidance. So, it's really a conclusion, I could draw, unless you see a fundamental change in the business year-on-year that's negative in nature? 
Rajat Bahri: Well, we are in the month of April, and as we come more closer to Q3, we will update our back half of the guidance on this point. We basically are not changing our stance for the full year except for the interest expense. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Alright. Got it. In currency, did you see any benefits from currency this quarter, either at top line or bottom line, and can you quantify it? 
Rajat Bahri: Yes. Currency always has some small impacts for us. Basically, the dollar did weaken against most of the European currencies. So that did have a small impact on our top line to our benefit. But, on the bottom line it looks in the reverse direction. When the dollar weakens, we have a lot of R&D expense and lot of operating expense in Europe. So, it hurts us on the bottom line, but the impacts are small enough that we haven't disclosed those. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: I'll confine myself to one last question, Steve. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that your internal review is interesting, unmet needs from the part of your customers. Were these unmet needs could be within the existing verticals or are we talking about the potential of Trimble's move into new verticals? 
Steve Berglund: So, I think this is probably more a matter of definition than anything else. It is what I see as one of our fundamental growth drivers, and it has been for a number of years. It’s what we would call the search for adjacencies. That may mean, bringing existing capabilities to new customers or to be bringing in new capabilities to existing customers or existing capabilities to new customers.  So, they may, in effect be, lets call adjacent verticals, but what we are definitely not telegraphing here is wild and new departures into areas where we don't have any domain experience or where we have no background. So, we do see a lots of growth opportunities in, let's call adjacent areas to where we already are which involve what I will call lower risk, lower capital requirements and all of that, but all of the incremental growth strategy in it. And, in fact, that's what we’ve been pursing here for a number of years. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you very much. 
Steve Berglund: Good bye. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Friedland from Soleil Group. 
Peter Friedland - Soleil Group: Hey guys, can you talk a little bit about what you are expecting for seasonality in the Ag business. Is it the same as prior years or maybe two-thirds of the revenue for that business come in the first two quarters, or are we seeing a change this year given the strength in the market? And then I have a follow-up. 
Steve Berglund: Okay. So, I think that I will characterize it is, okay there maybe secular trend here that's going to lift all the quarters, but I would not be calling a change in fundamental seasonality. Farmers tend to put things on their farming permit in times when it's not in active use which is called the relatively early spring, and then call it maybe late summer before the harvesting begins. But the seasonal patterns will remain in effect. I think perhaps we've been helped a little bit this year, because in some places there are relatively wetter spring which have kept farmers out of the fields and has maybe extended the selling season a bit longer than normal, but not making any prediction that the seasonality is going to change, but again there is an underlying -- we believe there is an underlying secular trend here that is lifting all the quarters, and so the fundamental seasonality won't change in our view. 
Peter Friedland - Soleil Group: And then in the machine control businesses, both in construction and Ag, any -- has there have been a shift from retrofit to the factory installers that’s still primarily for both markets retrofit? 
Steve Berglund: I think still in a significant majority of cases it remains an aftermarket. The aftermarket in construction is remaining viable for significantly longer than we would have guessed five, six years ago. And agriculture is still principally an aftermarket sort of a retrofit and very little was actually put on in the factory. 
Peter Friedland - Soleil Group: Great. Thank you. 
Steve Berglund: You bet. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Good afternoon 
Steve Berglund: Very nice, good morning. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Thank you. 
Steve Berglund: You bet Eli. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: So, just a couple of clarifications just on the @Road impact in the second quarter, I guess it gave us a little over 11.6 million in the first quarter. But, it's still showing $80 million, $85 million you are talking about roughly $20 million to $25 million a quarter in the next couple of quarters that sort of would be the guidance looks like? 
Rajat Bahri: That's in the range. I won't give you precise number, Eli, but that's in the range. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Is there any seasonality in that second and fourth, is there a seasonality in that business or --? 
Rajat Bahri: No, there should not be any seasonality. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. And you said it made a little bit of profit in the second and the six weeks that you owned it, is the implication in sort of guidance that you expect from the income statement point of view that to be almost no impact on the bottom-line from @Road's point of view marginally one way or the other, that's sort of a part of the guidance in it? 
Rajat Bahri: The guidance assumes that they will make money for the full year. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. 
Rajat Bahri: And that will be offset by the higher interest expense and higher dilution from the shares. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Yeah. Now can you give us what the interest expense run rates is going to be? 
Rajat Bahri: Sure. So, I think originally we had guided around $14 million for this year. Based on our current debt level we believe it will be around $9 million of interest costs. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: So, I was talking about what the $3 million for the next few quarters basically? 
Rajat Bahri: Yeah, that's right. We have $170 million and our interest cost runs around 6.1%. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. And the amortization number that we still have, the amortization of goodwill, will that change or is that to be run rate 4.1, does it go up in second quarter? 
Rajat Bahri: It does because @Road has been there for six weeks. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Yeah. How much so -- might be in the second quarter or for the rest of the year? 
Rajat Bahri: So, per quarter, next quarter we are calling it as $10.1 million. I think that's the number we had. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: $10.1 million for the quarter? 
Rajat Bahri: For the quarter, for quarter two. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. So it's going from $4.1 million to $10.1 million is what you are saying? 
Rajat Bahri: Actually it was higher in the first quarter. $4.1 million was just in the operating expense, we get some in the cost of goods sold as well. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. And how much --? 
Rajat Bahri: So, if you combine the two, the first quarter was, let me give you the exact number, amortization of purchase intangibles was $7.9 million in Q1. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. So, an increment of a little over $2 million would be spilt between cost of goods sold, again, and the amortization line or would it be just in the amortization line? 
Rajat Bahri: So of the $7.9 million, $3.8 million is in cost of good sold, and the rest is in operating expense. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: And we will have the same ratio in the next quarter? 
Rajat Bahri: Yeah. And roughly at the same ratio that $7.9 million we are forecasting that to go up to $10.7 million because we have full quarter of @Road, that's really what’s causing the increase in Q2. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Yeah, I realize that. And what's the share run rate, the actual share outstanding run rate; did you have a blended number also in the quarter? 
Rajat Bahri: For Q1, it was 120.9 million shares and for Q2 we are forecasting 124.6 million shares. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: And is that considered the run rate for the rest of year at this point? 
Rajat Bahri: It will slightly go -- every quarter, we give some options out, so it increases by 700,000 shares every quarter. So for the full year we are expecting around, I'll give you the numbers, just give me a second there, 123.8 million shares is the full year average. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. And at this point and when you look at the rest of the business, the only thing that sort of change, I mean the undermining market was fine. Is that over said we've had the surging costs around, whether it's material or copper or all sorts of crazy stuff. You don't really have any impact in most of the stuff that you have at this point. You are not seeing anything that's affecting you? 
Steve Berglund: No. I think that if it's going to affect us we are going to see it as a third order effect, as it will seen through a couple of steps before it gets to us. So, by the time it gets to us its some things that we probably couldn't detect if we wanted to. So, I would say it's got the potential for affecting us as a third order effect, but I would generally shrug my shoulders as to any real effect here. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Okay. And as a final, the success of the new Ag line, the new EZ-Guide or the EZ-500, I think it is, right so, I mean can you talk a little bit what's the market interest in that? It seems like that should be a hot, you know, the right amongst the right product at the right time, kind of environment. 
Steve Berglund: Yeah. Given the results that actually seems to be the right conclusion, but, there have been a couple of things that have occurred in the last six months at the lower end of the market. So, the market divides up by for lack of a better term, it's called the high-end and the low-end. The high-end is our Autopilot line, which is the most fully automated line, and that is actually doing very well in its own right.  But at the lower-end of the market, there have been a couple of actions that we've taken in the last six months. One was the introduction of the EZ-Guide 500, which has been very well received by the marketplace. But the other, towards the end of 2006 was, we actually took advantage of our cost position and we reduced the price on our existing EZ-Guide Lightbar line. This turns out to be a very elastic market, and so actually and quite price sensitive, and so we are taking advantage of that and so both actions combined together, I think, established a new value point for the farmer and I think the response has been very good as a result. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: And then finally, you told us about CTCT -- or whatever, the Caterpillar JV, I mean it looks like that business is starting to do quite well and I am wondering where you need a new round of capacity expansion or market expansion on that. I mean it just look that products starting to and it will get some traction. 
Steve Berglund: Right, well CTCT is doing well. Both Caterpillar and Trimble are contributing to that growth. I don't think there are any step functions involved here, walking around BAUMA last week, which has a major trade show for the construction industry. It becomes apparent that the technology is -- people are beginning, contractors are beginning are really beginning to get very comfortable with the technology. It is working into a more of a mainstream mode. And so as a result, I think the time has come, maybe the pioneering days are beginning to be a little bit in the past and now, we are entering the mainstream site. So I think, again no step functions, no discrete decisions made that are required of us other than to support the business. But I think it will be continuous, it will be incremental just as it has been but with a backdrop of I think a greater market acceptance. 
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Thank you. 
Steve Berglund: You bet. 
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Paul Coster from J.P. Morgan. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Yeah, thank you very much. The GNSS, the deployments that you've seen in the couple of geographies now, can you talk to us about what this means from the perspective of follow-on business in those geographies? Is it quite more stickiness for Trimble in those geographies? 
Steve Berglund: So, if you are talking about the new satellite constellations or are we talking about the VRS? 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: I'm talking about the GNSS deployments in for instance, I think you had one up in somewhere in the Northern states. I think it's Wisconsin or and then you have looking through a Polish deployment recently and. 
Steve Berglund: Okay. We are talking about what we called VRS Virtual Reference Station which is a something different than actually the GNSS, which could imply new satellite constellations coming in the future. So, in reality the VRS infrastructure does a couple of things for us. First of all, Trimble has been talking about relatively low penetration rates on survey instruments, GPS related survey instruments for machine control or the rest for some period of time. So logical question is what's required to penetrate the market more deeply and one other thing that’s required to penetrate the market more deeply, you can move it more aggressively into the main stream, let's call it the convenience factor.  Today, to deploy GPS down to centimeter level requires at least until recently has required a contractor or surveyor to set up their own infrastructure to put a GPS receiver at a known location to provide the correction signals. So, things like these VRS deployments, deploying infrastructure enables a surveyor or contractor to just say get that centimeter level of accuracy by the flip of the switch as opposed to going out and deploying their own infrastructure.  So, the convenience factor the threshold factor here has come down and as a result -- first of all, we believe that it enables the market being penetrated more aggressively than it has been historically. So the denser the infrastructure the better it is for us overall in terms of penetrating the market with new technology. And so, it's not per se stickiness but it is a major opportunity for us. At the same time is that it -- at the margin is a good thing that what's being deployed is Trimble technology to provide the infrastructure we understand how it works perhaps more deeply than anyone else, although at maybe available to others we maybe able to better integrate with it than others and therefore we perhaps get our performance advantage as a result. So, it benefits us in a couple of ways but overall this is a very good thing. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, got it. So VRS and the second question I had it was @Road has been partnering with Eaton Corp. but we haven't actually seen the outcome of that, but I understand from CTIA that the new products are now available for market and presumably the Eaton Corp. sales organization is ready to start pushing it. Are you seeing any early results from that or is it still too soon to sign? Can you comment full about that partnership? 
Steve Berglund: Yeah, well, I've been to visit Eaton myself since the @Road thing came up and I would describe Eaton as being connected to the concept. As far as actual results that are reflecting in Trimble's financials, I would still characterize it is too early to say anything. I made the comment in the script as that there are a number of contracts that have been taken, that have future potential, but which are, at this point in time, requiring a significant amount of R&D to get to the point of marketability. The Eaton contract, would, for example, be one of those where there is a significant front-end load that's somewhat of a drag on the financials and the revenue stream is yet to come. So, that would be one of the cases. But, as yet, it has not had a material effect on the top line. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Evanson from Dougherty & Company. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Couple of follow-ups for Raj. Raj, would you be willing to share the geographic breakdown of revenues on a dollar basis? 
Rajat Bahri: So, we have it and it will be in our 10-Q. I don't have the numbers with me. But, roughly I can tell you 52% of our revenues come from, the inclusion of @Road comes from US and the rest comes from rest of the world. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay. And then my second question is when you described the @Road acquisition in early December, you talked about a $28 million deferred revenue write-down. 
Rajat Bahri: Right. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Could you talk about how much of that came into the quarter here, and which line item that might have filtered through? 
Rajat Bahri: So, it doesn't show up as a line item. Basically, it's an opening balance sheet adjustment. When you pick up the balance sheet there is deferred revenue there and you've just picked up a lower balance then what's on that opening balance sheet. So, it really does not impact the P&L. The way it impacts the P&L is you don't get to recognize that deferred revenue over a period of time, because you have written it down. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: So, it's involved in the purchase accounting? 
Rajat Bahri: That's right. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Okay. 
Rajat Bahri: And you report lower revenue than @Road would have reported if they were still a publicly traded company. 
Jeff Evanson - Dougherty & Company: Absolutely. I got it. Thank you. 
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks? 
Steve Berglund: No closing remarks other than it was a good quarter, and we will talk to you in three months. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's Trimble Navigation quarter one earnings conference call. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.
