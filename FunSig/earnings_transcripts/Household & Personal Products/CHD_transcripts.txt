===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight’s First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Rick Dierker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Rick Dierker: All right, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with some thoughts on the macro environment and review our Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Lee McChesney, our new CFO. When Lee is done, we'll open the call up for questions. As you read in the release, we have several topics to discuss this morning, including Q1 results, portfolio changes, tariff management, U.S. consumer spending, and the revised full year outlook. With that, let's turn to how we performed in Q1. During our presentation at CAGNY in February, we stated we expected our organic sales growth to be at the low end of 0% to 2% range due to retail destocking and weakening consumer demand as it turned out, organic sales decreased 1.2%, falling short of our outlook. Retailer destocking accounted for a drag of approximately 300 basis points on organic growth. The good news is our strong brand performance. We gained share in nine of our 14 major brands as our consumption outpaced category growth. 80% plus of our business grew volume share in the quarter. Contributing to our Q1 results is our success in the online class of trade with online sales as a percentage of global sales now reaching close to 23%. In a few minutes, I'll contrast our Q1 consumption with category growth when I comment on the major categories. Regarding earnings per share, adjusted EPS was $0.91 beating our outlook by $0.01. Now, let's discuss the strategic actions we outlined in the press release. Each year, our management team reviews our brand portfolio with the Board of Directors. And in concert with that review, the company completes a valuation exercise for each and every brand. As a result of that review, the company is pursuing strategic alternatives for the Flawless, Spinbrush, and Waterpik showerhead business, which means we'll be shutting down or selling these businesses. These businesses generate $150 million of net sales or around 2% of our total net sales, with below-average profitability. We expect to take a charge in Q2 relative to this decision. This decision will prune our portfolio, sharpen our focus on core brands, and mitigate a significant tariff exposure, which is the next topic I would like to discuss. Turning to tariffs. While the tariff situation remains fluid, the company is currently projecting a gross 12-month run rate tariff exposure of $190 million. The net impact of the portfolio decisions and a series of supply chain actions is expected to reduce our tariff exposure by approximately 80%. The supply chain actions include no longer sourcing Waterpik flossers from China for the U.S. market. Our ability to move with urgency to execute these changes as a testament to the Church & Dwight culture. I'm very proud of the company and the reaction that we've done here. Now, I'm going to turn my comments to each of the three businesses. First up is the U.S. Consumption was positive in the quarter for the U.S. business, while organic sales declined 3%, entirely driven by negative volume from retail destocking. So, let's look at the trend line. In the U.S., consumer spending continues to sequentially weaken. For context, it's constructive to look back at our U.S. year-over-year category growth since around mid-2024. In the second half of 2024, category growth averaged 2.5%. In Q1, our categories grew around 1.5%. March was flat and April was negative 1%. And remember, for context, over the last 10 years or so, category growth is typically around 3%. In addition to the consumer, retailers took inventory actions, which impacted our top line. Now, I'm going to provide a bit of color for a few of our important categories. Let's start off with laundry detergent. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent consumption grew 3.4% in contrast to zero category growth. ARM & HAMMER share in the quarter reached 14.7%. There's a similar story on unit dose. ARM & HAMMER unit dose saw consumption growth of 26.9%, which drove 120 basis point share gain to reach a 5.5 share. This is in contrast to a weak unit dose category, which declined 1.1%. Now moving to litter, similar story to laundry, the category was up 1.9%, while ARM & HAMMER litter consumption grew 2.3%, which outpaced the category and share reached 24.9%. The gummy vitamin business continues to be a drag on the company's organic growth. The gummy vitamin category grew 4.8%, which is the second consecutive quarter of growth. The bad news is our consumption was down 19%. The plans that we shared with you on previous calls will begin to be visible in the market started in May. Those actions include new products and enhanced taste profile and new creative marketing. We'll update you on our progress on the Q2 call. Next step is BATISTE, consumption was down 5% in the quarter with share declining 3.4%. There are a couple of contributing factors. One is we were experiencing some supply chain issues that have since been resolved. In addition, a competitor had a significant price increase that impacted our dollar share. On a positive note, BATISTE continues to be the global leader in dry shampoo, and this year, we're launching BATISTE Light. As a leading brand, our innovations continue to attract new users to the category and increase household penetration. Over in mouthwash, THERABREATH continues to perform extremely well. While the mouthwash category was flat in Q1, THERABREATH consumption grew 26% and is now the number two mouthwash with a 20.3% share. Remember, we believe there's lot of runway here as our household penetration for THERABREATH currently sits around 10.5% versus the category of 65%. HERO is the number one brand in acne care with a 22% share and continues to drive growth. HERO grew consumption by 13%, outpacing a 1.1% decline in the category. HERO market share grew 280 basis points in the quarter. And similar to the THERABREATH story, we believe household penetration growth is key for this brand. Currently, it sits at 8.7% versus the category of 25%. HERO continues to launch innovative solutions and patches and entering the growing body care segment in 2025 with the mighty patch body. Looking ahead, we're excited about our pipeline of new products, which remain a key driver of our success. In 2025, we expect continued innovation to power our growth and build on our momentum, especially in several core categories where we're leading the way. And we spoke about many of these at our Analyst Day in New York. Now, turning to international and SPD. Our international business delivered sales growth of 2.7% in the quarter. Organic sales increased 5.8%, largely due to higher volume. Growth was led by HERO, THERABREATH and WATERPIK and was broad-based with all of our subs delivering growth. Finally, SPD organic sales increased 3.2% due to a combination of higher price and product price mix and higher volume. This business continues to deliver, and we continue to be excited about the future. Looking ahead, our full year organic growth outlook is now 0% to 2%, driven by a weaker U.S. consumer. We expect our Q1 brand share momentum to continue, bolstered by our new product launches, our distribution gains and sustained full year investment in marketing. After considering the trend line that I shared with you, we do not see a catalyst for improvement in the U.S. consumer. Our outlook also reflects no bounce back from Q1 retailer destocking. For adjusted EPS, we now expect 0% to 2% growth, which reflects the impact of lower sales and the impact of tariffs. I'll close by saying that, despite a slowdown in category consumption, our brands are strong. They're doing well. We're gaining both dollar and volume share across much of the portfolio with a healthy mix of value and premium offerings. And we're well equipped to navigate the current environment. The strategic actions we announced today will position the company well for the future, and we continue to be on the hunt for the right acquisitions. I'd like to thank all the Church & Dwight employees, for executing well in a volatile environment. And now I'll hand it over to Lee, for more detail on the quarter.
Lee McChesney: Thank you, Rick, and good day to everyone. Before I jump into the quarter, I do want to say thank you to Rick and the entire CHD team for warm welcome. I've only been here for a month or so, I've already seen what makes this company such a strong performer as the team is focused on execution. We are acting swiftly to address the challenging macro environment that nearly every company is facing today. With that, let's dive into the first quarter and our outlook. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.91, down 5.2% from the prior year. The $0.91 was slightly better than our $0.90 outlook. Reported revenue was down 2.4% and organic sales, was down 1.2%. The organic sales decline was due to lower volume of 1.4%, partially offset by positive pricing and mix of 0.2%. Our first quarter adjusted gross margin was 45.1% and a 60 basis point decrease from a year ago with improved productivity, positive mix and higher margin acquisitions being offset by the impact of commodity inflation, higher manufacturing costs and lower volume. Let me walk you through our Q1 gross margin bridge. We saw 160 basis points from productivity, a favorable 10 basis points from the combination of mix and price and positive 10 basis points related to the acquisitions. Those factors were offset by the headwinds I just mentioned above and 20 basis points related to FX. Moving to Marketing, our marketing expense as a percentage of sales was 9.3% were 80 basis points lower than 1Q of last year. For the year, we are targeting 11% of net sales. And accordingly, we expect to continue our first quarter momentum and gaining market share. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the year-over-year volume change. Other expense decreased by $7.7 million, inclusive of lower interest expense, and higher interest income. We continue to expect other expense for the full year to be approximately $50 million on an adjusted basis. In Q1, our effective tax rate was 22% compared to 19.9% in Q1 of '24, a 210 basis point year-over-year increase. The expected adjusted effective tax rate for the full year continues to be 23%. And now to Cash, for the three months of 2025, cash from operating activities was $185.7 million, a decrease of $77.3 million versus last year due to lower cash earnings and the sales timing impact on working capital. Capital expenditures for the first three months, was $16.5 million, a $29.8 million decrease from the prior year. We expect 2025 CapEx of approximately $130 million as we return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025. Let's now take a few minutes to walk through our outlook. For the full year, we now expect our organic revenue outlook to be approximately 0% to 2%. Previously, that was 3% to 4%. The sales outlook now reflects the slower category growth and the retailer inventory reductions that we don't expect to recover. Full year gross margin is now expected to contract 60 basis points versus 2024. Previously, that was a positive 25 basis point outlook as we expect the tariff impacts persistent commodity input inflation costs to offset the incremental productivity. We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be 0% to 2%, down from our previous view of 7% to 8%. This is primarily due to the lower sales outlook, and the tariff pressures. Cash flow from operations for the full year is now estimated to be approximately $1.05 billion due to the impact of our lower EPS and the onetime charges. For 2Q, we expect organic sales of approximately negative 2% to flat and as a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.85 per share, a decrease of 9% versus last year -- last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. As our outlook implies, we expect EPS growth to be weighted towards the back half of 2025 through the marketing investment timing versus last year. And finally, as we noted in our release, this adjusted outlook as of April 1, 2025, excludes charges and the ongoing results for the Flawless, Spinbrush and Waterpik showerhead business. Those charges are expected to be between $60 million and $80 million largely recorded in 2Q and two-thirds is expected to be noncash. With that, Rick and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So obviously, a lot of areas to cover. But maybe I'll just start out, just as we look at your updated organic sales growth guide, is there any way to get updated expectations by segment and it's related to that do international play out with your expectations for Q1?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Sure, Rupesh. Yes, Q1 was spot on for international. Lee, do you have the division that you can share?
Lee McChesney: Sure. So international, as we talked about, had good growth in the first quarter and organically about 6%, SPD was about 3%. As we look forward, we expect international to be in a zone, maybe a little bit of pressure as some of the macro pressures spread across the globe. SPD will be maybe slightly better than it was in the first quarter. The domestic business, obviously, we're -- you can imply in the outlook, we had negative 3% in the first quarter. We're looking for a similar performance here in 2Q and then an improvement in the back half, still be slightly negative to get to the overall outlook of still 0% to 2% organic for us in total.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then I guess, maybe just my follow-up question. Just given a softer category outlook and the backup that you're seeing right now, what do you see on the promotional backdrop in the quarter? And then how are you thinking -- and then do you expect the promotional backdrop to intensify from here?
Rick Dierker: Yes. That's a fair question. For the quarter, when we talk about promotional, we really talked about laundry and laundry in Q1 was 34% amount sold on deal very similar to what Q4 was, very similar to what Q3 was. So not a huge step up right now. A lot of things happening on the laundry category. There's concentration happening from one of the peers or some price increases in another part of the tiers as they switch out different offerings. And so it looks like there's a little bit more promotional going on right now as they work through those old inventory and transitions. Litter is the other example. Litter promotion was around 18.8% in the quarter, sorry, 17.8% in the quarter, it was 18.8% last time. So again, stable as categories are flat, though, people tend to increase their promotional spend. I'd say we're well positioned for what we think is the right level of promotion our assumption for category growth used to be around 2.5% for the year. It's closer to 1.5% these days.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Anna Lizzul: Hi. Good morning, and thank you so much for the question.
Rick Dierker: Hi, Anna.
Anna Lizzul: Hi, Rick. I was wondering, if you could just discuss maybe your expectations for the category relative to market share growth since you did mention software trends in April. Are you seeing a significant difference here across the premium and value segments of the business in terms of the slowdown? And just on the value side, are you trying to see any benefit here from trade down or anticipating a benefit as we're moving through the year? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So if you take a big step back and you look at our outlook, organically, we're saying the midpoint is around 1%. And we saw a minus 1% in Q1, we're saying Q2 looks lot like that, so maybe minus 1%. And then that implies something closer to around 2% in the back half. And -- like I just told Rupesh, the categories themselves, we used to think we're going to grow 2.5%, and we were going to grow faster than that. We think the categories are going to grow maybe 1% to 1.5%, and we grow a little bit faster than that. In terms of trade down, surprisingly, we're still not seeing the amount of trade down that we would expect if this type of environment perpetuates. So Orange Box still isn't growing faster than Black Box on Litter, as an example. The value part of the laundry category is not growing as fast as the mid-tier and the mid-tier, again, is growing a lot behind Deep Clean, our new innovation. But when trade down happens, those 2 things will be a trigger. And I expect our extra business as well will do better. It's just -- we have to be down like this for a period of time. So I believe that we're in early days of this type of environment. And we're well positioned for when we stay here.
Anna Lizzul: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris Carey: Hi, good morning, everyone. Can you guys frame within the reduction in earnings for the year, how much was the revenue call down versus tariffs -- and maybe just simply put, what is the tariff effect that you're embedding for this year? And can you help give us a bit of clarity on the wraparound tariff impact into 2026 unmitigated for some of the sourcing changes you're making and then perhaps, how you're thinking about your 2026 absolute tariff exposure. I mean, effectively, there's this $190 million number, but what we're going to end up seeing in the P&L is substantially lower? So how does that look in '25 and 2026? Then I have a follow-up.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Sure. I'll give you my thoughts, and then if Lee has anything to add, he can do it. Just taking a big step back on the tariffs, I really do think this is a great example of Church & Dwight moving with speed and urgency -- a gross impact of around $190 million on a 12-month run rate basis. And I just want to be clear, we're not taking those strategic actions because of tariffs. We've been discussing internally for some time, and they've been on the list of businesses that we believe are or either have a better owner elsewhere or we're going to shut down. And even as recently as this past summer, we went through those details with the Board. And so those 3 businesses though at marginal profit levels at $150 million of sales are really hit extremely hard by tariffs. So it made sense to kind of fast forward that discussion and that decision. So that $180 million goes down to $100 million when those 3 businesses have strategic options around it and then that goes down to around $40 million after we've made the manufacturing decisions for Waterpik flossers as we've moved that business out of China over time. And so to be able to go from $190 million gross to kind of a $40 million number is fantastic. And then we're going to continue to be working through supply chain activities and maybe nuanced pricing over time to reduce that even further. So in the P&L for 2025, to answer your question, there's a net number of around $30 million in our outlook -- if you do the wrap around the 2026, that's why we kind of say it takes 12 months to do some of the rest of the supply chain activities. We won't go through all the detail, but we expect to further mitigate that number over time. And that's a -- is it an issue? Yes. But after all that work, that's a manageable issue that we feel pretty confident on being able to mitigate over the next 12 months or so.
Chris Carey: Thank you. From the connected in a way that what you were saying about some of these businesses that you had presented to the Board and have thought about strategic alternatives, how conscious, the vitamin business, how to plan for this year on a performance category is widening. At what point does patients with plan run out content you have a strong balance sheet, which gives you a lot of options to do many things. And so maybe give us updated thoughts on where Vitamin sits within your meeting the long-term plans and maybe what's happening this year that hasn't gone as well as maybe what you would have hoped relative to your going plans? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes, fair question. I think right now, we're kind of in that a little bit of that circle where you have negative consumption. That leads to lower TDP growth. Lower TDP growth distribution points leads to lower consumption. What we're laser focused on is the innovation, the best tasting reformulation change in marketing to reach the right consumer and to do some coupon and to go drive trial. Loyalty rate is actually very low in the vitamin category. I think it was like 8% or 9%. So if we can go get those consumers to retry our best tasting formulas. And again, the new innovation is Power Plus, our most powerful vitamins. And I think we have a good chance to have some green shoots and inflection points in that business. That business is not meeting expectations. We said last call that we needed from April through July to see if this innovation turnaround and investment is working. And so that's why in my prepared remarks, I said, we'll talk more about that after Q2.
Chris Carey: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Thanks operator and good morning everyone. And welcome Lee to the call. I wanted to just go back, you called out in terms of consumption, I called out the 300 basis points reduction in customer domestic for the inventory destocking. But if you can comment also on HERO, it was a big model of growth. And I understand all the actions you're taking and the brand continues to be strong, but I'm assuming it is hitting a very tough comp. And as you said, like for vitamins is obviously completely different story between the -- between HERO and the vitamin side. But talk about the distribution points and how we can think about that brand continue to grow as you lap the growth? And then on the commentary just on a clarification on the promo side, I understand the depth and how the percentages are, so don't promo, but if you can comment on the depth of the promotions, if there is a to your point, some these categories, leader in laundry, perhaps having a little bit more depth and for how long you think that's going to normalize. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Thanks for that question, Andrea. I would say for HERO, we are still really pleased with consumption. It's double-digit consumption up 13% in the quarter. I think the nuances happening in HERO is, remember, it's overexposed to a few retailers. It started at a few that are having foot traffic issues. And so -- it's doing great growth almost everywhere, apples-to-apples, but foot traffic declines at a few different retailers kind of over-indexes to HERO. But overall, with that said, double-digit consumption is fantastic. We still think we have TDP growth -- we believe we -- with our share of market, we're under-indexed as shelf in many places. So not only just going to new retailers and new distribution by just being able to spread out on shelf. It still happens that by Sunday or Monday, the shelf could be empty. And I think we gave the example at a few of our conferences that at a few retailers at times, especially at tentpole events, but times, the number -- the top three units or dollar sales at any retailer is water, paper towels and HERO. So it's doing really, really well, and it still is, and we have some great distribution gains ahead of us. Moving to sold-on Promo, you're right, the percentages kind of tell you the frequency, depth is a different story. Most of the -- I would say, it's a little opaque out there, but different concentration moves and different pricing moves and some of this being spent back on promotion -- and I would say, right now, we view that as transitory because of size changes and SKU changes and whatnot. If that extends for a period of time. We'll talk more about that in Q2. But for now, I would say, pretty much in line with what we were expecting.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Steve Powers: Good morning. And welcome Lee as well. I guess, Rick, the guidance implies -- I think your expectations are explicit about back half improvement in organic growth. And I'm just juxtaposing that against your expectation that you're not really expecting consumption to improve and we've seen the step down in April. So acknowledging that the destocking in 1Q probably doesn't continue as a base case. Just what's the bridge to back half improvement?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I think it's a fair question. I think positive category growth, I think it is kind of unique for us to have – I went through it in the release, but I'll say it in my script, I'll say it again, right, 2.5% growth in the back half 2024, 1.5% growth in the quarter, March was flat, April was down 1%. It is extremely odd for these categories to be negative. That is just not something that we have seen, and we don't expect that to continue for a very long period of time, they tend to grow around 3%. I get that we're in a volatile environment, weak consumer confidence. A more volatile world than ever. But these categories over time, we still expect to return to growth. And then we have distribution gains happening in the back half. We have innovation, even incremental innovation that we didn't necessarily share in New York. We have strong marketing. We're going to keep our marketing where it's at. The long-term strength of the business is to drive share over time. We did that well in Q1. We expect that to happen throughout the year.
Steve Powers: Okay. Fair enough. And then just back to your commentary on vitamins and the initiatives you're putting in place between now and July, as we follow along from the outside, what does success look like in terms of monitoring things as we go? And then ultimately, what is the I mean the expectation clearly the ambition is to be winning and growing. But what's the expectation as you think about initiation putting in place and the returns you're likely to get in the back half and then as we exit 2025.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So look, the green shoot to the inflection points that we want to see are things like -- and they're going to be very obvious, like part of it is going to be our weekly POS on our multi-bit business, right? And given all the reformulation work and the advertising and the trial that we're pushing, we need to see the trends inflect higher. I would say customer and consumer reviews are a big deal. Like are we taking a step up? And are we hitting the mark on what the consumer needs and wants. That's a big deal. Are we getting have we stopped the decline in TDPs because the retailers believe in the story of our innovation because we're not just launching a new multi-bit, we're doing a reformulation across the entire lineup. We're doing a new Power Plus vitamin, we're doing sugar-free variants, we're doing a GLP offering. So it's a holistic innovation and is that enough to give it a shot on shelf. So those are some of the tactical things that we're going to be looking for over the next few months. I would say probably the most important one for me is, are we growing from here? Like we've made and are making some strategic decisions that we don't need to be in all classes of trade. We don't need to be in every subsegment of vitamins. We want to make sure we're retrenched a bit, but we can grow and are confident of growth from here. And so that's what -- again, over the next three months, we're going to make that call.
Steve Powers: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thanks and welcome, Lee. You guys mentioned the potential for pricing, realizing it will be very surgical. But given the macros in declining categories, how do you layer in price? And what's your view on the promotional environment going forward? And then given this backdrop, how do you think you can continue -- could you talk about how you continue to drive penetration in your newer categories like HERO and THERABREATH so that they can continue to contribute in the outsized way that they have? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Good question, Olivia. On pricing, I'm actually really pleased with, again, the commercial organization here at Church & Dwight. And we're handling this just like we did COVID really the first few weeks. We have standup meetings every week, sometimes multiple times a day, and we're doing all types of actions. Because in this environment, you're exactly right. The last thing you want to do when categories are flat to down is try to go take price. And it's not good for the consumer. It's not good for the brand. And so we've worked really hard to mitigate 80% in the short term and probably more than that over the medium term. And so that's going to enable us not to take price. There might be a couple of examples where we do. And again, that's going to evolve based on how the external environment evolves because things change from Thursday to next Tuesday. So I'm just happy and pleased with the culture of this company and how quickly we can move when we need to. But I would say, overall, so far, we've been able to not have to lean in and take price. The second one was on penetration, especially for our -- some of our new businesses like HERO and THERABREATH. And that is the story in my mind. We are so under-indexed still on household penetration. And I think I gave you the numbers in in the prepared comments, but like around 9% for HERO and 25% for acne and THERABREATH, a much bigger opportunity for sure. And so that means in an environment like this, we should be doing a couple of things. One, we're reallocating media where needed to higher and best use. And those two brands have a higher and best use for sure. We're committed to spending at the 11% of marketing clip even in an environment like this because we want to go drive awareness and household penetration. And that's the name of the game in this -- that means these two businesses have years of growth ahead of them. So combined with the marketing investment, we're going to continue to innovate with those two businesses. We have global expansion for those two businesses, and we're thrilled with kind of the growth curve that's happening.
Olivia Tong: Got it. Thanks. And then just following up, can you talk about the drivers for the 85 basis point change in the gross margin guide to down 60. How much of that is deleverage potentially some negative mix, you talked about potential for more trade down as the year progresses versus what you embedded in terms of tariffs. It seems like it's mostly tariffs, but just the flexibility within the rest of the P&L or within the operating guide. If you do start to see more trade down and that impacts the gross margin line?
Lee McChesney: Yes. So I'll jump in there. So again good morning. Thanks for the welcome. So, yes, I think similar to what you saw in the first quarter, we're down 60 basis points, and we're saying actually that's the view for the year as well. So behind it, obviously, we talked about the inflation, operations costs being mitigated by productivity, a little bit of price mix and then benefit from the mix into acquisition, higher margins. As you think about it from a full year perspective, productivity is still strong. We're frankly driving incremental productivity. There's a bit more inflation still holding in there is even a little bit more coming in the marketplace versus four months ago, which is weird to think about in this macro environment, but that's the case. And then to your point, the big driver, though, just difference wise is tariffs. And we talked about a little bit earlier, a holistic 12-month number and just what we think will settle into this year. And obviously, as we work through our different actions, there's obviously different timing events to those as well. That's the primary driver.
Olivia Tong: All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.
Peter Grom: Great. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, Lee as well. Lee, maybe just a quick question for you. I mean, I think you mentioned that 2Q U.S. or domestic sales will be similar to 1Q. Could you just unpack that that a bit, I think the guidance assumes market share gains? And I think Rick mentioned category growth would be down one. So I guess I'm just curious how you get to that minus 3%?
Lee McChesney: Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean to your point, we noted what happened in the first quarter with the inventory impact. And certainly -- we certainly don't expect that much impact in the second quarter, but there's still a bit more. And then as Rick talked about, the category, the consumption levels have continued to slow down. And so yes, one should be less of a negative and then once is going to be a new negative for us to manage. So that's what we're seeing here in April. Again, it's all about us driving share, but the macro is just a bit softer.
Peter Grom: Got it. That makes sense. And then, Rick, just a question for you. I think you said it's odd what you're seeing in terms of category growth. I'm just curious, why do you think this is ultimately happening? Why is it happening as quickly as it is? And then just on the April commentary, I get different categories, geographic exposure, but it is a bit different from what we've heard from some of your peers thus far. So what do you think is causing the difference in terms of your April performance or what you're seeing versus maybe what some of your peers are saying?
Rick Dierker: Yes. No, Peter, it's a fair question. No, I would just say, usually, our categories are a good bellwether because we're going across so many different categories, like we play in 18 categories. This represents most of those categories. And I would just say it goes back to the core consumer feeling pressed. And I think even before tariffs, we were seeing signs of the core consumer being pressed. And we talked, I think, even back in January, maybe at the end of year, in our categories, we're growing 4.5% -- maybe 4% or so in the first half of 2024, and then they were decelerating to 2.5%. And we had called that out. And maybe it was at Barclays and everyone thought that we were being a bit of an alarmist, I would say, at the time. But we were just trying to be as transparent as we can, and we set up. This is what we're seeing. This is kind of the curve of what the consumer is doing. And that started going down a little bit further in Q1. And then the whole tariff noise started happening. And I think that uncertainty exacerbated what was already going on. And when that uncertainty happens, it's going across many different categories, ours included. But I also think it's that type of feeling transitory as this environment hopefully is. And while I think we have a malaise with the consumer for a period of time, maybe a year or 18 months, whatever it is. I think right now, it's exacerbated. And this volatility is causing people to take a step back. And so that's what we're seeing. That's what the consumer -- this isn't us. This is our categories. And I think more of our peers will start saying that if they haven't already.
Peter Grom: Got it. Thanks so much. I’ll pass it on.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Lauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning. Sort of boring housekeeping I'll admit. But in the release, you talked about that as of April 1, you'll exclude the businesses that you're going to be divesting or exiting or excluded from results. I was just curious how we should handle that as we model? Like are we putting it in the structural line? Or is it in net sales or just completely gone? And will you be restating the base just so we again, know how to model?
Rick Dierker: Yes. This is -- we're trying to -- it's a complicated situation. So we're trying to keep it as clean as possible. Our organic outlook excludes the impact from April 1 to December 31 of those three businesses. And our adjusted earnings will exclude the profit from those businesses from April 1 to December 31. The other lines of the P&L, because it's reported an adjusted P&L, they will have it in there. So we're going to do our best to be as clear as we can. But for those are the two lines that I think really matter, and that's how we've laid it out.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. So we should think about the adjusted EPS, the absence of those businesses is still a headwind for EPS?
Rick Dierker: The absence of those businesses we're going to put the -- in that one-time charge will be mostly the non-cash charges. And as we run out those businesses, there will be a lower sales and profit impact to those businesses. So, net sales would be down reported. And we'll also have a charge partially in Q2, but for those businesses in Q3 and Q4 that represents the profit for those. So we'll try to delineate that for you.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: And that was not a boring question.
Lauren Lieberman: For me it was. I appreciate it.
Rick Dierker: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Hi good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just want to go back to the retailer destocking comment and kind of what's changed between now and a couple of months ago when you were anticipating that -- those orders to kind of come back over the year progresses? I mean, obviously, like a lot has changed with the tariff situation and consumers pulling back. But why do you think the retailers wouldn't restock if the consumption is still there? And then separately, just any updated thinking around the M&A environment? I know you've been talking a little bit more about maybe looking at some international assets to add to portfolio, any change in thinking with the current macro situations going on? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Thanks, Korinne. I would say you hit it on the head. The pullback in the consumer the agita around tariffs, I think that's what's going on. And that's why categories, even in the month of April so far negative. And that's why in March, they were flattish for us. So, retail inventory, even a few months ago, we thought would recover because exactly that, our consumption was running ahead of our shipments. And so we said, okay, well, that's just a matter of timing. We've seen that play before and no problem. But the longer it's going on and the more uncertainty that's out there it just feels like everyone's retrenching a bit is what I would say. And then on international M&A. International M&A is, yes, still a strategy. We've got to find the right one. we're looking at different countries. In many cases, we would love to do what we did in Japan with Graphico as you create really a subsidy infrastructure and you can bring your brands there in an easier way. So, we're always on the lookout for those kind of bolt-on acquisitions. And meanwhile, the team is spending the leadership team spending an awful lot of their time looking for the right acquisition. We've had a bit of a of a dry spell, but we still believe the number one use of cash and capital allocation as does the Board is M&A. And so this management team spends a large percentage of time looking for the right acquisition both here in the U.S. and outside the U.S.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi guys. Good morning. Maybe a follow-up on the inventory levels at retail. I guess what gives you the confidence that inventory shouldn't bounce back or that there should be a restock. Is there something you're seeing in the market? Is it channel mix? Maybe you were high on inventories towards the end of 2024. But the idea of sort of consumption being ahead of inventories and then sort of staying that way for the whole of the year? Just feels like something that maybe we don't see that frequently. So, I'm just curious what might have changed and what gives you that confidence that this was a one-time step down. This is where it is going to be?
Rick Dierker: Yes, it's a fair question. I would say it's probably the expectation that Q2 looks a lot like Q1 given what we see in orders that there's not a bounce back coming. I think when you have negative or flat consumption across many categories, the retailer doesn't maybe want to lean back in to get to what we think is the right level. And we have heard other retailers, continue to talk about taking down weeks of supply. Do I think there's an incremental risk for retail inventory? I absolutely do not overall, because there's only a certain level that the businesses can be run effectively with. So I don't really feel like it's an incremental risk, maybe it's a little bit of conservatism and maybe we'll be proven wrong. We just think there's flat to slowing consumption in the near-term. And we said for the back half, we think it's closer to 1.5%, which is lower than our 3% typically. So yes, just the inflection point a little bit is what's driving our thinking there.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. And I guess in the context of everything you mentioned on the consumer, you talked a bit about promo activity being rational, but maybe how do you feel like, where it's going to play out over the course of the year if the consumer stays in the sort of conditions that they might be in? Would you expect promotional activity to pick up? Or -- is it not a pricing thing, there's just something else going on?
Rick Dierker: No, I think we've seen this play out before back in 2008 and 2009. And if categories are flat for an extended period of time, competitors tend to go after share in a bigger way. And if you look at all the transcripts, everyone's talking about how they're going to gain share. Well, not everybody can gain share. We've proven in an environment like this that we do tend to gain share because we have the right promotional strategy, right marketing spend. We have the right products and value offering innovation. And so we're usually setup better than most. But promotional levels do tend to go up if categories are flat for a period of time. But what I just said is why we believe that tend to take share.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Javier Escalante: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I've managed to still have a question on the inventory issue. So if you could help us if there is anything to learn about categories and the type of retailers where you're seeing greater lag in terms of reorders. I'm specifically thinking about the drug stores, very important for vitamins. And there is a lot of changes there, and there is a lot of problems with traffic is this particularly a pressure area? And if so, how that informs the re-launch of vitamin business, which is a category that is increasingly going online.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Sure, Javier. Gummies and the drug class trade are very, very promotional. You walk in and you see a whole aisle full of yellow tags, which are tend to be buy one, get one free. As we're looking to reach rent, we're making decisions on what class of trades we want to play in. And I would say the sales and profits are not as appealing in that class of trade typically. So we're kind of retrenching on what SKUs, what offerings, what promotion depth that we're willing to go to in that class of trade. And there is a flat traffic concern in the drug class of trade. There's also -- one of the retailers is not as financially stable as some others. So there is a lot of noise, I guess, going on in the direct class trade. But again, we retrench to where we have strength and we grow from there for vitamins. But the online class of trade is interesting – online class of trade is actually half of all vitamins. And -- so we've got to make sure that we're hitting the innovation and advertising, but really also focused on the online class of trade. And so specifically, it's very fragmented, but half the category. So we are we're looking hard at what the right innovation strategy is and the short-term innovation strategy is to make sure that we're going after those subsegments appropriately online because if that's where the growth is, that's where the focus needs to be.
Javier Escalante: And Rick, if I may, if you can expand better on the laundry detergent piece. So there was a very weak read in April, I believe, is the guys in Germany -- so if you can unpack a little bit, I mean you mentioned it, but it was very briefly that there is a lot of moving pieces. But if you can unpack what is happening in detergents in the context of your push with the clean and the trade down into mid-tier. That would be very helpful. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So look, the laundry business is healthy. In Q1, we had 3.4% consumption growth for ARM & HAMMER. I think we had 26% to 27% growth for unit dose. Even for scent boosters, we had 8% plus growth and extra had positive growth as well. So largely for us, we continue to gain share in all those subsegments. And so we think we're doing and executing really well. I kind of alluded to it. There is some noise going on in the category. One competitor is catching up on some of the concentration activities that happened a year or two, a year or two ago. One competitor is taking price at the top end and spending a bit more, I guess, in the low and mid tiers. And then one major retailer introduced private label at the premium end. So there's a lot of moving pieces. I would say we're better positioned than ever in this type of environment. What tends to happen in a recessionary-like environment, and that's why I would start to call this environment that we're in, right? Consumer confidence as we look forward. It's at a 12-year low -- this turmoil. What tends to happen is folks trade down to value. And even Deep Clean, while it's a mid-tier to us, the consumer doesn't know what mid-tier or premium or value really mean. They just know that it's a 20% discount to premium -- the premium tier of laundry. They know that it's more expensive than our most basic offering. But we have a good, better, best strategy so that base ARM & HAMMER can do well. ARM & HAMMER ahoc can do well and now Deep Clean does as well. So we're well positioned to wherever the consumer trades up or down to.
Javier Escalante: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. So I just wanted to touch on U.S. share. You guys mentioned you still expect to gain share in the U.S. despite the category weakness. But the tracked channels and it does look like it's decelerated in terms of your share so far in April. And I would assume, the Q2 corporate org sales guidance when you back out international, which is robust as well as pursued growth in SPD that you're assuming share loss probably implicitly in that Q2 guidance. Can you just shed some light on maybe overall trends in the U.S. as you look at April your thoughts in the balance of year here on a go-forward basis also? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Good question, Dara. I am never assuming share loss is what I would tell you. I believe like I talked earlier, because of our portfolio, because of our brands, because of the advertising and the innovation and the promotional program we have in place. We have a long track record of growing faster than the category. And I fully expect that to happen now. And as we have a stretched consumer, our brands are made for this time as well. And so all that's going to help and lead to share gains. April -- or you're right. We're -- I think I said the category is down 1%. We gained in Q1. I expect to gain share in Q2. Sometimes, it's just promotional timing to some degree. But that's the short answer to the question.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. That's helpful. And then obviously, the external environment changed fairly significantly in recent months. You're taking decisive actions on portfolio structure. I was just hoping you could review capital allocation from here given your strong balance sheet, might share repurchases a greater priority perhaps there's more M&A opportunities from an external environment standpoint given the difficult environment and just how you think about those two pieces. Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes, we talked about it a lot. And even though we haven't done a deal in a couple of years, it doesn't mean that's not number one on the capital allocation priority. So I joked in previous conferences that M&A is number one, two, three, four on the list, and that's still true. We believe that we have a competency in identity, acquiring and integrating and growing acquisitions -- and there's no better value creator for the company than just that. So we have a huge amount of firepower. The math that we showed at CAGNY was around $6 billion we could do a couple of deals and the organization can tend to do a couple of deals even sequentially. So that's the number one capital allocation and focus. And if you look back at our history, if we go a long period of time without doing acquisitions, then we tend to look at buybacks. In some cases, given this type of low leverage, we could probably do both. But number one, I want to keep the powder dry for M&A. And so if we don't do M&A for a while, we'll look at and talk more about doing maybe any buybacks. Lee, anything to add that?
Lee McChesney: Yes. I would just add, number one, one of the reasons I came here and completely believe in this capital allocation methodology. I have a whole history of doing M&A, making sure you have a discipline in doing M&A. And we've shown that we find the right acquisitions and we drive value-enhancing TSR. And then obviously, that's one, two and three. I guess we'll do -- behind that is we're continuing to invest in the business, even in this environment, whether it's -- we talked about the marketing side, the innovation side and then obviously, things like debt and shares that Rick talked about would be on the list too, but every day, we're focused on number one, number two, number three, which again, you'll find that right deal for the -- to bring to the portfolio, but we will remain very disciplined.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.
Filippo Falorni: Hi. Good morning. I had two quick clarification on the guidance. First, within the organic sales guidance of 0% to 2%, can you give us a sense of what you're assuming for the full year for volume and price you mentioned price increases, some surgical price increases, maybe can you give us some sense of timing and some magnitude there?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I mean I would tell you, we talked about -- you got pretty quick position. We talked about price quite a bit. I mean, price has been positive. We'll just say it's going to be flattish for the rest of the year. Our outlook is all about volume growth.
Lee McChesney: Yes. And the price increases that we're talking about, that is over time, if we can offset tariffs. In my mind, we're going to work like to do just that. And we believe that will be a competitive advantage versus other folks.
Filippo Falorni: Got it. That makes sense. And then on the tariff front, you mentioned the €30 million net tariff impact after the mitigation -- is that what is embedded in the gross margin and EPS guidance? Or should we think about somewhere around 50 basis points of negative hit on gross margin and then somewhere around like $0.09 on EPS. Is that the right way to think about it.
Lee McChesney: 40 to 50 basis points. Obviously, the exact timing will play out depending on actions and mitigations and things like that. That's a good number.
Filippo Falorni: Okay. Got it. Thank you so much guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. A Couple -- Rick, a couple for me. Rick, just getting back to the decisions around the portfolio pruning. So the business lines that you're exiting certainly makes sense not hugely impactful at about 2% of sales. I think there might have been some sense among some in the market as the divestitures directives could have been larger. Is this pencils down for the year, given it's an annual review process? Or would you consider further divestitures in the future? I'm curious what's your commitment to a business like vitamins. Presumably, you want exit from position of strength. So maybe that's the reason that, that is perhaps on hold for now. A quick review, maybe just on the criteria at a high level for hold versus an exit. And I have a question for Lee. Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Well, look, we do go through a portfolio strategy review every year. Like I said before, we value each and every brand. There's a handful that are always on the list, and then we turn to a few of them and say, can we internally improve those businesses. And some of those things are underway. And so it doesn't mean that if those businesses don't do and accomplish those KPIs that we want that we couldn't wake up and say, yes, that's on the list to do something with. So just because we have an annual review, it doesn't mean that there aren't other things in motion that we're always working on. Vitamins, we want to inflect that business and turn that positive for all the reasons I gave earlier. And we'll talk more after Q2 on how we're doing with that. And so I think that's a better question to ask after that quarter.
Kevin Grundy: Okay. Fair enough. Lee, welcome. Quick question for you. You mentioned the M&A dynamic and the appeal of that in terms of coming on board. What are your early impressions more broadly? Any potential areas where you think your background can potentially enhance the way Church is doing things, whether this is around productivity, whether it's around revenue growth management, capital structure, et cetera. Would love to get your early impressions and thoughts.
Lee McChesney: No, I appreciate you're asking the nice question. So I mean, number one, very impressed with the CHC team. I mean, obviously, I can follow in from the outside and the track record speaks for itself. But to be inside the building and to meet the people and the culture, the mindset to execute. I mean I think in my first 5 weeks, everything we're showing here, the tariff situation continued to be a bigger challenge and look at the plan we've laid out here in just less than 2 months as everyone's dealing with that. The team is very focused on -- I love where I see what's going on innovation. Certainly, the continued focus on brand development, winning share. Those are all things I fundamentally believe in. This business -- my focus right now is to learn this business. This business has been successful. And I want to understand that. I want to obviously get more time to get out and meet people and understand what goes on across the globe at our different manufacturing sites. And my mindset is just to contribute my experience to what we have focused here. I believe in the Evergreen model, as I went through the process and you got to spend time with Rick and other members of leadership team. We have very similar thoughts and very focused on driving share, always making decisions with that in mind, but the same token follow the facts, find the right balance to protect gross margin. There's efficiency with how we run the business to drive this overall high level of cash return. Those are all things that frankly just match with me. That's one of the reasons why I'm here. So I can just say with now 6 weeks in, it's everything I thought it'd be in more. So I'm optimistic as we look forward here.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And Lee's being humble as well. He has a great pedigree experience on M&A, right? Decades of experience with M&A on acquiring, integrating, he has decades experience, not just as a CFO, but as a President of different businesses. So to have somebody in the seat that's an operating CFO is exactly the culture of this place, and we're going to be better off for it.
Kevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you. Good luck.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Robert Moskow: Thanks. Rick, you've talked about having the right advertising, the right promo, the right spend. And -- but the world is changing quite a bit in last 4 months. So other than vitamins, are there any categories where you've had to shift your tactics maybe lean in a little more from a promotional standpoint? Or because your market share is good, you feel like, hey, we can just keep executing the plan as it stands.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Not from a promotional perspective, really. I'll tell you, we are pivoting a little bit on our advertising. We just walked the Board through it, but Stacy is our CMO. She's doing a great job, and she laid out how we're shifting our messaging more towards value in this environment, right? Some big steps in doing that, reminding people across the ARM & HAMMER brand that we are value, but across our other brands, too. And I think that messaging is going to be important in times like this. And so that's kind of one pivot we're making. And we're pivoting a little bit on what brands we allocate media to and where we over-indexed or under-indexed.
Robert Moskow: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Rick Dierker for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Rick Dierker: Great. Well, thank you for your time today. I would just tell you that the company is laser-focused on growing share, launching our innovation to delight the consumer. And we're a stronger company for these portfolio actions and look forward to talking to everybody next quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2025 Q4  (2025-01-31 06:00:00) =====
Matt Farrell: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for coming today. This is the 2025 Analyst Day for Church & Dwight. We got a big crowd with us today. We got the entire management team. We got a couple of casualties due to the flu that's going around. So let's begin with the safe harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read that, after class. I'm going to here's a list of the people who are going to be here today, all the presenters. We've got Shitij Chabba from SPD. We've got Mike Read from International. We've got Surabhi Pokhriyal our Chief Digital Officer. It's the Rick and Matt show as usual. We got Stacey Ramstedt, who's our CMO, and Carlos Linares. You haven't heard from Carlos in the past. He leads R&D and Innovation for the company. Alright. Long agenda here. I won't read it to you, so let's, kind of jump right in. But I'm going to start with 2025 is the 35th anniversary of Church & Dwight being listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And you can see the chart there, if you adjust for stock splits, was a buck a share down back in 1990, and you can see we're well over a $100 today. Here's kind of a fun fact. So if you invested $1,000 in Church & Dwight in 1990 when it was first listed, it'd be worth a $114,000 today. So that's kind of a mark of a consistent company. And, the fellow on the lower left is Dwight Minton. Dwight Minton became the CEO, I think in 1969. He is the -- a descendant of Austin Church, of the Church & Dwight fame. So he's the last family member of the company to take to be a CEO and he succeeded his dad who was CEO before him. So I'm the third non-family member who's CEO of Church & Dwight, and Rick will be the fourth. So fun fact. So look at -- let's look back at 2024. As you all know if you've been following our story, organic sales growth, we beat our algorithm all three businesses U.S., International, and SPD. We have seven power brands represent 70% of our revenues and profits and 507 increased their market share. Our algorithm for our marketing spend is spent about 11% annually. And we spent over 11 in 2024. Innovation, it's a big number for us this past year. So if we grew our organic growth 4% on a full year basis, half of that came from new products that we launched in 2024 and that's incremental growth year-over-year came from new products and then online sales, we've been a bit of a standout among CPG companies for quite a few years. Our online sales are is over 21%, it's 21.4% for total company. What that translates to -- is if you have $6 billion in sales, we got $1.3 billion of that is ordered online. A few more things, we bought HERO a couple years ago. That's been a great brand for us. We've expanded that, it's now launched in 40 countries, and now our job is to grow that brand in those 40 countries around the world. Japan, it's a big market, over a 100 million consumers we acquired a terrific distributor of ours in Japan. It as a distributor that drove OXICLEAN to the number one pre-wash additive in powder in Japan. SPD, you're going to hear from Shitij Chabba today. And that's now perennial grower for us. I'm going to hear more about that. We generate a lot of cash as a company, and we're [$1 billion] for 2024. And we got a lot of dough on a balance sheet. Almost a billion dollars of cash at year-end. And we're all dressed up to buy some businesses going forward. All right, strong performance this is the 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 year chart for us. And this give you an idea of the consistency of this company for many, many years, and it's really attributed to the culture and to the management team of Church & Dwight. Now, who we are, many of you are long-term holders. People who are here today are listening on the phone. I'm going to run through things that should be very familiar to you. So the way we're split is 77% domestic, 18% international. For a long time, that international number was 17%, almost since I joined the company. So we're starting to grow that one to move faster. Seven power brands that make up 70% of our revenues and profits. And we have an evergreen model. So this evergreen model is something that guides our view long-term, not just for the coming year, but three years, five years, 10 years. This is what we try to drive, how we try to drive TSR for our shareholders. So you see the 4% organic sales growth, it's 385, domestic international SPD, our gross margin, 25 to 50 basis points, the bright line for marketing is around 11% of sales. We try to get leverage on SG&A. So we try to go grow the top line faster than SG&A grows, and we're trying to expand our operating margins 50 basis points annually, and that translates into 8% EPS growth. So here's the formula. Five things I'm going to cover. One, we got a balanced and diversified portfolio, so we got pretty much balanced between household and personal care. And SPD is essentially the foundational business for the company. It's where the ARM & HAMMER brand first arose. We're split pretty much 60/40 or I should say two-thirds, one-thirds between premium and value. Why is that important? It's what important because we perform well in just about any economic environment. We don't have a lot of exposure to private label. You can see that a little bit over 10%. That's been true for many, many years. Any e-commerce has been a great story for us. We were probably fourth quartile back in 2016, and now we're first quartile with respect to our performance online. And as I said earlier, half of our growth, organic growth in 2024 came from new products. And of course, that is so important to the equity of your brands is new innovation. So, that speaks really well for the company, and we got a lot more coming in 2025. As far as acquisitions go, we're pretty strict about what we're going to buy. Got to be a number one or number two brand. It has to be a gross margin that's at or above the gross margins for the company. We like businesses that are asset light. Prefer to buy a business that is that is co-manufactured, that we don't necessarily have to buy a plant. Number four would be, can we get synergies? We've got a very, very sophisticated supply chain to make damn near anything. So, consequently, we try to get leverage in manufacturing or logistics. And then finally, it's got to have a long-term competitive advantage, meaning we don't buy something that's just going to be successful for the next two or three years. It's going to be successful 5 years, 10 years out. All right. Long history of growth through acquisitions. So, if you look at 2004, we were a $1.5 billion company. You can see almost every year we've acquired a business. We don't have every year up there, but just about every year we've acquired something. 2023 and 2024, bit of a drought. I'd say if you say when did have you had a drought before, if you look at 2008, we acquired ORAJEL. 2012, we acquired the vitamin business. Between then, we bought some small businesses. But I would say that was the time -- last time we had a drought of a couple of years, not for lack of trying though. So now Rick's going to come up and take you through a few more details.
Rick Dierker: All right. Thank you, Matt. So, this is probably one of the last times I'm going to go through detailed financials with you guys. Okay. Q4 2024, we ended the year with momentum, right? We had 3.5% reported sales growth. Our outlook was 1.5% to 2.5%. It came in better than we expected. Our share gains for the quarter 5.07%, or for the year 5.07% of our brands grew share, right? Those are the important brands that are driving the company. 4.2% organic came in better than we thought too. 2% to 3% was our outlook. Gross margin came right where we thought it was. We called 110 basis points for the full year, and that implied flat for the quarter. And then for EPS, we were up almost 19%. So, just really strong ending to the year and the quarter. So, for the full year, 4% net sales growth, 4.5% organic sales growth, 3.5% for domestic, 9% for international and 7% for SPD. So, just really broad-based growth across the company, across the divisions, back to 110 basis points of gross margin. You're going to see in a minute, we're back to 2019 levels, which is fantastic. Marketing, this is where we spent incrementally. We ended up at 11.4%. So, we spent significantly more than we originally thought. And this is really just, again to have momentum as we entered in 2025. And then 8.5% EPS growth, and we generated $1.16 billion of cash. You're going to see in a minute, 2025, we think we're going to be right around the same number. So, just generating a lot of cash. Our free cash flow conversion is around 115%, and that gives us a lot of optionality. So, look ahead. Matt did a great job of saying where we have been and where we are, a lot of things that are great about this company. We have confidence in our future, okay. This is really the outlook for the evergreen model over the years to come. Matt walked through why that's healthy, why that's doing well. I'm going to walk through in a few minutes how household penetration is a huge opportunity for us in the U.S., right? THERABREATH house THERABREATH HERO, of course, these fast growing businesses. But, litter and laundry are doing well, and some other brands are driving growth as well. Mike will come up. He'll talk about the high growth rate the international business has. 8% clip is very impressive. We have high aspirations for that business, over the foreseeable future. Innovation, Carlos will come up and he'll talk about how we innovate. We've totally transformed over the last 5 or 10 years how we innovate, going from one vector to more like four or five different vectors. And then Stacey is going to come talk about what we've innovated. And so the new products we have, very excited about many of those. Year two as well for some of the big launches we had last year. And then Surabhi will talk about our e-commerce growth and being digitally savvy. I know our e-com growth, you saw the chart that Matt provided, 2% going to 21%. This is an advantage for us, and we're going to continue to drive that forward, not just domestically but globally. Focus on domestic and international M&A. M&A is a huge part of this company. So here's a new slide. This is back in the year 2001 or 2000, we had one power brand. It was ARM & HAMMER. We were a $1 billion business. Fast forward 24 years and we're ARM & HAMMER is around a $2 billion business, right, mid-single-digit CAGR over 20 years plus. That brand is known and loved by consumers across many categories. It's rare to have a brand that can play in so many different categories. And then that means we have $4 billion of businesses and brands that are not ARM & HAMMER. And that ability to identify, acquire, integrate and grow brands and businesses is a competitive advantage for us, and we're going to keep that and hold that dear, and we're going to continue to do that as well. Moving to the U.S. story. We are hiring a new U.S. President and a new CFO, but today, I am the U.S. President as well. So domestically, our algorithm is 3%, right? The company is 4%, we do 3%, 8% and 5%. We have a long track record of growth organically in the U.S., and we have a lot of confidence in our future. 3.5% this year, why do we have confidence in our future? We're leaders in growing categories. You'll see in a second, our categories are largely green. We thrive in difficult environments. Why? Low exposure to private-label, but also household and personal care are balanced. And then our acquisitions have room to run. Our seven power brands fuel our growth. Matt showed a slide that said 70% of our sales and profits from those seven brands in those eight categories. In 2025, it's closer to 75%. So these brands are driving the company. Here's the snapshot report card on the categories. Again, we're in the right categories. This isn't happenstance. We acquire businesses that get us into categories that we like the attributes of. Weighted average, 2.7% growth, largely green in 2024. That's fantastic. And then we're one of very few companies that do this, but here's the scorecard from our brands. This is our share growth. And again, five of seven grew in 2024. So let's go to the individual businesses. Fabric Care our laundry business is growing at or above category averages which is great gaining share. In fact, we're at all time share highs. You look at the left side of the page, we're at 5%, 18 years ago, and today, we're at 14.5%. And why is that? One thing that's working really well is our good, better, best strategy for ARM & HAMMER Laundry Detergent. Orange bottle is our value brand. ARM & HAMMER with Oxy is in the middle, which is our better offering. And then Deep Clean is our best offering. Right? Consumers are picking up Deep Clean, and they're sticking to it. The incrementality rate on Deep Clean is very impressive. Stacey is going to talk a little bit more about new products around Deep Clean, so stay tuned for that. Cat Litter is saying, we're growing at or above category rates. This is actually doubly impressive because a competitor was out of stock last year, and so we maintained largely maintained our share despite that, which is a great result. Hardball is a big opportunity. This is lightweight litter, and a year ago we were around a 4 share, today we're around an 8 share, a 7.5 share. If we get our fair share of the clumping litter category, that's about $100 million opportunity. And so we're really encouraged by the progress we've made already on lightweight, litter category. HERO and THERABREATH. So HERO is -- first up, HERO consumption is off the charts, it's 40% growth, it's driving the category. And we're not just talking about the patch, we're talking about total acne. So we have the number one share in patch, but we have the number one share in acne as a larger category. And we have a lot of room to run. Distribution has been fantastic. We have lots of distribution gains. We think there's more, as we spread out on shelf, our TDPs will continue to go up, but more importantly, it's household penetration, 9% household penetration for HERO, 25% for the category. We're going to continue to invest our marketing dollars behind HERO to drive awareness. Similar story for THERABREATH, THERABREATH is 40% plus consumption. It's driving the category. And it's not just the number one non-alcohol mouthwash, it's actually the number two overall mouthwash, all-time share highs for the year 17.5%. But same story is HERO. A lot of room to run here too on distribution points, we've made some great gains. We think we're going to spread out even more on shelf in the years to come. You'll hear from Mike about HERO and THERABREATH for international. There's great momentum there as well. So household penetration we're at 10 share in households for THERABREATH. But look at mouthwash, 65% of households have a mouthwash. And so again, we're going to invest marketing dollars and innovation behind this category. And as you look at the trend line over a long period of time, that just shows that we're the number two mouthwash and we've been that way for the last three or four months. And then BATISTE, BATISTE is a category and a brand that has great growth, mid to high single-digits, and we're gaining share in BATISTE as well. Hitting all time share highs. You're going to hear about innovation and even maybe some ad campaigns from Stacey, our CMO. VITAFUSION vitamins, this is a business that has declined a bit. But let's take a step back. Here is the category. The category doubled over the last two or three years. Went from 1.5 billion to 3 billion. It's stabilized and it's flat. Now for these last three years. What's happening now? We're down a bit. We're down double-digits. The good news is the category is starting to inflict, that's a green shoot that's happening. And what are we going to do about it? We brought forward and rapidly, we broke glass in the organization to move innovation at a very fast clip. So we're launching an entirely renovated portfolio. This goes across all of our SKUs, in terms of new and improved formula. That's number one. Number two, we're launching our most powerful vitamins ever. This is Power Plus MultiVites. Stacey will go into a little bit more detail. And then third, there's a real need for sugar free in the category. And so many of our variants will be available sugar free. So these aren't me too innovations. These are going to be large investments and innovation, and we're going to support that with the marketing that it needs to be supported with. This is our -- in my opinion this is what's going to help drive that business forward, and new products. So, with that, I'm going to introduce Stacey who's our new CMO, and she's going to tell you about what we have on tap for 2025.
Stacey Ramstedt: I am so excited to be here and to talk to you about our new products. So, we're going to have a little bit of fun. Okay? So, let's start first with a review of what just happened in 2024. Matt mentioned that our new products drove 50% of our incremental growth for the company. So, the - - what you see here are three of our heaviest hitters. So, let's talk first about Deep Clean. When dirt and stink run deep, we want you to clean deeper, and you do this with Deep Clean. And our consumers absolutely did that in 2024. So Deep Clean established that best year category, but also drove incremental growth for the brand. So, next step we have ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets, and this really marries the ARM & HAMMER Clean with the convenience as well as the mess free format of a Power Sheet. So, this allowed us to tap into the fastest growing segment in laundry. And last and certainly not least, we had ARM & HAMMER Hardball. ARM & HAMMER Hardball is our technologically advanced Hardball lightweight litter, and so that makes cleaning your litter a breeze. So, what I love about this story is, one, there is a tremendous amount of runway with these items. So, we're going to definitely invest in growing awareness and trial of these items so we can drive incremental growth in 2025. But furthermore, we're going to expand on each of these in 2025. So, I'm going to take you through some of that. Okay? All right. But before we get to our first innovation for 2025, let's take a look at the free and clear segment within the laundry category. This is a huge segment. It's $1.3 billion, and it has absolutely been skyrocketing over the last couple of years. Now we already have some products that fit within this space, but we've identified an opportunity to capture an additional over $20 million in incremental opportunity. So, I'm going to talk you through, how we're going to do just that. All right. So our first new product for 2025 is ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean. This is our free and clear detergent. And so, as you would expect, this is catering to the consumer with more of a sensitive skin, and it's certainly free of all of what you would expect. But the real game changer with this item is that we are the only brand with the SkinSAFE certification. And this is something that's very meaningful to consumers as it gives them the assurance on product quality and safety. All right. So, continuing with that theme, I'd like to introduce you to our ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets in a fragrant free format. So, this is what I call uncompromised clean. So, this is dermatologist tested. It's free of dyes and perfumes. But the real breakthrough is that this item has 50% more cleaning than the leading value brand because our consumers do not want to compromise with their product choices. All right. Last but not least, we have ARM & HAMMER Plant Power. This is our clumping litter, and what's the scoop? The scoop is this, we are bringing our hardball technology into the natural segment. And this is why this is such a big deal. Consumers who buy natural litter feel that, it doesn't do as good of a job to control odors, and that's because many natural litters will use additives, and those additives lead to mushy or brittle clumps. So with our hardball technology, we do not use additives in our natural version for superior clumping. So we really think that this is going to do very well in the natural segment and believe, if we were to get our fair share, this could be over $30 million for this product launch. Alright. And that would be incremental. Moving on, and Rick stole some of my thunder here. We are going all in on VITAFUSION, and we have three new initiatives planned for 2025. And we really are moving at lightning speed to make this happen. We are, first going to introduce a new and improved formula. People, this is going to take taste to the next level. So I want you to imagine a burst of flavor, a velvety smooth texture. This is with our innovative heat-resistant formula and softer chew. So not only that, we've also given our MultiVites a kick with 10% more Vitamin A, C, and E. So really excited about this launch. Alright. What's up next? We've got, VITAFUSION Power Plus MultiVites. This is our most advanced formula. We have formulated with a 100% daily value or more of 10 essential ingredients. This is more than any other gummy in the market. And then we've supercharged our advanced formula for adult multis with calcium. We've given the women's multi a boost of choline. And last but certainly not least, we've given our men's multi a boost of CoQ-10. So really excited about getting this item into the marketplace. All right. This is another teaser slide. This is where we're going next. Sugar is the biggest barrier preventing non-users from using gummies. And it's no surprise then to see that sugar free gummies are really taking off in the last couple of years. So we plan to expand on our sugar-free segments and portfolio of products. This year, we're launching Power C as well as men's multi. When you add those two products to our suite of sugar-free items. This is going to represent more than 60% of VITAFUSION sales in a sugar free variant. Because make no mistake, consumers do not want to compromise. We want to give them that same great, update to the taste experience, but in a sugar free formula. So we know this one's going to go over really well. Alright. Switching gears. Rick talked about HERO and how much HERO is a key contributor to growth, for Church & Dwight. So it's no surprise. We're going continue to innovate, for HERO. And specifically, I'd like to introduce you to our HERO Mighty Patch Body patch. So I may be able to speak for all of you, but body acne is a real pain in the butt. It's also a pain in the chest, in the back, and so forth. So it makes sense that we launch our largest patch, we call it our XXL patch, which is over 3x the size of our next biggest patch, which is the surface patch. But again, the real game changer here is the notches that we've built into this patch. And so with these notches, it's for better adherence to your curved body parts. Also, when you move, it adheres to your skin so it stays put exactly where you want it and still gives you that same absorbing gunk within six to eight hours that we're known for with our mighty patch, pimple patch. But now, we can take care of that back knee and chest knee and so forth. So we're really excited about this item. So the last new product that I have for you, and this is just for the first half of this year, is I'd like to introduce you to BATISTE Light dry shampoo, because some days do call for a lighter dry shampoo like day three and day four. But even more importantly, we know that non-users do not want that white residue or that gritty texture that they can get sometimes from a dry shampoo. So I'm going to say to you that this is a triple threat. Our BATISTE light dry shampoo has no white residue, a lighter feel, and a beautiful soft fragrance in our mellow melon and matcha zen flavors. So again, consumers don't want to have to compromise. They're going to get the same great superior BATISTE efficacy, but now in a lighter formula. So I'm really excited about this one. All right. So I feel like I could not be leading marketing for Church & Dwight without showing you a spot or two. So I do have two creative spots that are finished. They're ready to go. So you'll be seeing them first before anybody in the marketplace. And we are launching BATISTE Light dry shampoo with these two new spots. So if the people behind the scenes could play the video. [Audio-Video Presentation] Sometimes my job can be a lot of fun. So we have a good time with that one. Alright, so I'm going to leave you with this. This was just your teaser for 2025. This is what's launching in the first half of the year, guys, we have more coming in the back half of the year. And so if I were you, you might be asking, so what's behind the magic that makes innovation, this innovation, and that I'm going to say is my intro for Carlos Linares, who's going to -- who heads up our R&D and he's going to walk you through just exactly how this innovation comes to you all in the marketplace. So thank you. That's what I've got for you. All right.
Carlos Linares: Okay. Thanks, Stacey. So tough act to follow is the marketing and the ads. All right. Yes. So, I'm here to talk to you a little bit about how we think about innovation and how we've kind of transformed innovation. And just a quick thing about myself, we haven't been in these forums. But so, I've been doing R&D innovation for now close to 40 years. Big company, about 20 years, Procter, J&J, and then led some smaller midsize companies, in in both beauty and home. So, I came to Church & Dwight about seven and a half years ago, attracted by the brands, the culture, and really kind of an invitation to innovate differently. So, my kind of key messages today as I go through this is we have transformed how we innovate at Church & Dwight. I'll show you some of that, and it's also a unique approach that we've developed for Church & Dwight. So, it is not a smaller version of what you may hear from some of our bigger competitors. It is unique, and that's why we think it's sustainable. So, let me first talk about, what are we doing to create differently. So, Rick mentioned this before. We've gone from one innovation source in a sense to five. And not only are they additive, really the use the challenge here is how do you make them complementary and not competing? And I think that's part of what we do differently at Church & Dwight. So, let me kind of give you a couple of different levels of why this complementary connection is very different for us. So, when I joined the company, you kind of look at our portfolio and it continues to grow a lot of brands, a lot of diverse brands, a lot of diverse categories, and yet we're very proud of our revenue per employee. So, that's a challenge when you look across the organization. So over time, we've looked at it and the highs, how do you flip that model into an advantage into a strength. So, our advantage today is we really want to connect a lot of these diverse dots, which are really least innovation, better than others do and probably in ways that others can't because we know personally, I know what the big companies can and can't do, and they really can't break the silos the way that we can because of our size and our culture. So, let me give you a kind of a very concrete example. Last year, we introduced BATISTE Sweat Activated, and how do we get there? So, if you go across our or across our, brands and our categories, odor control, odor reduction is a common consumer need, right? Whether it be oral care, laundry, litter, women's health, deodorants, you name it. That's a very common need. So, rather than attack that individually by R&D department in a sense, we create these platform teams that go across and try to create scale. So, the idea is, hey, if you're looking at odor, talk to each other across the organization and connect those dots better than others. And when we go talk to the outside world and our partners, we go to them as a company, not as an individual business unit. So the BATISTE story is one of our partners identified some things, some technologies that were really existing in other categories, and we were the first to bring them over into hair care. Others could have, but they never did because they're not really talking to each other, Right? They’re very vertical in how they do it. So, that's kind of a bit of our magic with connecting these diverse competencies. And if you kind of elevate that to these five innovation sources, it's kind of the same story. Other people could do this, but in most companies, they've got one kind of dominant work stream for innovation. We've got these and they're not really competing. They're really complementary. So today, kind of end result is more than 50% of our pipeline is coming from these new innovation sources. So, not only are we adding in terms of the contribution, but the total pipeline is actually now much better than it ever was before. So, kind of, once you have a great robust pipeline in a sense, now it's about making choices. So, this is our other unique way of looking at our innovation across our categories, which is this very simple grid around science-based innovation versus business growth. But this is really driving our behavior when we have a good strong portfolio. It’s how do you make them bigger, kind of the arrows here? So whether it be choosing where do we make the marketing investments, where do we leverage these across different channels, or where do we leverage these across international. It's all about creating the scale once you find something that you really, really like. When you step back, today, our innovation portfolio is more balanced than it's ever been before across all the types of innovation. We have more transformational innovations, which are what we call our blue box. It's the upper right hand side. Stacey mentioned a few of those. We're very proud of all of those that are there. Shoots in particular, I've never seen a product where from early development all the way to launch, the consumers love them all the way through. We've never had a negative reaction to that product. It's really intuitive and loved. And we have got more coming. Unfortunately, we're here in the beginning of the year. There's some things that we'll reveal later on in the year because it's too soon, but we've got a very strong pipeline coming. The last thing is we got bigger bets, and we that's just kind of the top of this of this grid here. We got a lot of products. Stacey's mentioned a few of these. I'm not gonna go through, the list, and then Mike is going to talk a couple of these in the international portfolio too. Okay. And let's just talk results. So basically, if you look at all these together, we have now increased and accelerated our incremental net sales from historically, it was 1% to 1.5% to 1.5% to 2%. Our metric for innovation is in INS, right, incremental net sales. So it is not other people measure it differently. This is not gross sales. This is post cannibalization, so we're not just looking at replacing our products. Every time we're looking at innovation, we're looking at how does it grow and how does it add to the company's growth. That's why, as Rick and Matt mentioned, last year, we were contributing half of the growth. It was pure incremental growth from innovation. If you step back and say, okay. When we kind of started this in 2017 or so versus today, given the size of the company, that change from 1% to 1.5% to 2% is really almost a 4x in incremental dollars every year, because the company's grown, so the challenge becomes bigger every year. As we drive that, we're looking at 4x what it was seven years ago. So and it's also -- it's working, but it's also sustainable. We think 2024 was our best ever. 2025 is continued momentum. You said, you've heard a couple of these, but we truly believe that the model, because of the way it's working for us, we think is going to continue to contribute long-term. And then one last piece to cover before I hand it over to Mike, kind of our global footprint. We've got seven global centers, four of which are outside of the U.S. And each of them have very clear responsibilities. We have no overlap. We're too lean to have overlap with within our categories. You see the big flags there are our seven global centers. And then we also have six regional sites, which are kind of the smaller ones. And this is really more about putting the basic, whether it be technical folks or regulatory folks to help Mike and his team grow across around the world. The next thing, kind of back to that connect the story, all of these folks now, if you look at typical R&D products, package and development and so forth, regulatory people feeding the global structure, our plants quality people, and our innovation folks from marketing, they're all under one roof. They're one R&D organization. So that's why for us that that power of that that connected team, again, it's another thing that probably the big guys can't do. They're much more vertical. The smaller guys don't have that luxury either. So it's another one of the advantages. Everybody's now marching towards, a really humming innovation engine to be honest. So as we look at this we feel, we've transformed R&D and innovation, but given where we're at today, we really feel confident that we could continue to do that going forward. And with that, I'm going to choose Mike Read, Heading up our International team.
Mike Read : Good afternoon. My name's Michael Read, I lead our consumer international division as well as our specialty products group. And I'm delighted to have Shitij Chabba with us here today. So he'll take us through the SPD business in a few moments. So I'll focus on the international story. As you know, our evergreen model for international is 8% organic growth per year. And just to ground everyone, we're about 1 billion in size. We operate kind of in two parts, about just under two-thirds of our businesses through our subsidiary markets. We have six subs that we run, Canada, UK, France, Mexico, Germany, and Australia. The rest, the 37% we run through our GMG businesses are global markets group. And we operate over a hundred countries, and we work through almost 400 valued distributor partners around the globe. And we support that with five regional offices, one in Shanghai, one in Singapore, one in Mumbai, London, and Panama. And those offices continue to grow and add resources in order to support the growth we've got in those respective regions. 2024 is an outstanding year and certainly capped off with a great Q4. Our sub-markets grew almost 5%, and our GMG business grew 19%. I point to a few things. Certainly over the last couple years, we've had increasingly better service levels. That's one key part of it, but more importantly is we've had really consistent growth across the market, strong portfolio management, and we've really leveraged some of our new acquisitions particularly here on THERABREATH. They've been really strong drivers for us. Most importantly, if you look back a couple years, but throughout the year we've had really consistent growth across the quarters. So we're seeing broad-based growth across brands, across markets, and across quarters. So just again, just to reinforce the momentum and the confidence we have in our plan and our strategy, we've seen some really consistent growth and we see that continuing moving forward. If you look back over the course of the last 10 years, we had a little bit blip, certainly during kind of COVID and some of those kind of tougher years, but kind of X that we've had really strong consistent growth for a really long period of time. And we now have elevated our evergreen model to 8%, which we're really confident in. This came up early around, we have about 18% of our businesses international, and that's still a fraction versus many of our competitors that have been on their international journey a lot longer than we have as a company. So this really gives us the kind of the opportunity and the momentum to keep growing. There's a lot of runway both from a geographic point of view and also from a brand expansion point of view. So we see this not as a bad thing, but actually as real opportunity for us to grow. And we're growing at a really fast clip, I think most notably is, our brand portfolio travels extremely well. And we leverage kind of three parts. One is we do leverage our U.S. power brands like ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, VITAFUSION, et cetera. Those perform strongly across the globe in their respective categories. We also have a unique set of brands that are either internationally only, or largely been built out of international. Those are mostly, OTC and personal care brands like BATISTE, THERABREATH, FemFresh, Gravel et cetera. Those are really high performing brands in many, many markets. And then I think we're doing an increasingly good job of accelerating our acquisitions and getting them market quicker and having them a bigger part of our growth story here on THERABREATH, certainly are the two notable ones there. Speaking of HERO, so last time when we were here, we talked about kind of how quickly we're going to roll out HERO to over 40 countries. In 2023, we moved to 12 pretty quickly where we could get registrations. We've moved to over 40 in 2024. We'll be in over 50 early in 2025. So this is the fastest we've rolled out a brand, as we've acquired from a U.S. business and taken it globally, and that'll become the blueprint and the playbook for us on future acquisitions. But a really great job of getting this to market really quickly, and we're seeing really strong success as a result. STERIMAR, which we haven't talked a lot about in the past is one of our biggest brands internationally. It's in over 90 countries. This year, we're celebrating our 50th anniversary, but really high CAGR growth for us. We have a very strong portfolio within the natural nasal hygiene space. This is a really important brand internationally that continues to grow and is a really important part of our portfolio. That's a little bit different than what you'll hear from the U.S. domestic team. Stacey touched on the importance of innovation in BATISTE. We've certainly benefited that on our active SKUs with Sweat and Touch Activated. They've been really incremental additions to our international portfolio. BATISTE is the world's largest dry shampoo brand, widely distributed, and a really strong grower for us. But innovation is a critical part of that, and we're seeing some really strong results in all our key markets. OXICLEAN has been a really great driver for us and a focus, and it's not available in a lot of markets yet, but will continue to grow in terms of market expansion, but 20% growth last year and that's increasing our CAGR over the last few years. We are the number one powder brand in both Canada and Japan, and we've since just launched into the liquid segment in our Japanese market. So, really exciting opportunity for OXICLEAN to continue that momentum. It's got a long runway ahead. And then finally, from a brand point of view, I'd just touch on Power Sheets. So, we don't have liquid laundry in many of the markets around the world, but Power Sheets is something we have pushed into. It certainly gives us an opportunity to establish a new segment in many of the world's geographies. We got into 12 markets in 2024. We're going to be in more than 25 by the end of 2025. We're already number one on Amazon in Mexico, and there's really good momentum where we've got distribution. So, this will be continue to be a focus, and we'll learn to see what we can do. We'll also pick up a good amount of the innovation pipeline from the U.S. market as well. So, really great opportunity to sort of lift and shift and see where we can get some momentum in a category we really haven't played in traditionally on a global scale. So, we've got lots of things we invested in and lots of confidence in where we're growing as a brand or as a division rather. What I would point to is there's a few thing here that's not an exhaustive list, but I think they're notable ones. In the middle of this year, we made an acquisition of a long time value partner in Japan, which is the graphical team. We see Japan scaling up over the next number of years as we add additional brands to the portfolio. We've implemented a major global ERP system, so it's easier for us to kind of work with on a global basis, and as we grow our partners and can kind of grow with us. We widened our regulatory and IT infrastructure quite significantly, and that is kind of lines up with the regional offices we have around the globe. We've expanded our offices in Panama and Singapore as the teams widen and as the business grows. We touched a little bit on here, on THERABREATH, really strong acquisitions for us. I think I would add just leveraging NPD from other markets. Those two things combined have been a really big part of the growth story. And lastly, and Matt and Rick touched on it earlier, we are we have put resources from an M&A perspective in both Europe and APAC in order to start to get into the deal flow so we can look at international acquisitions. That would be in addition to leveraging any acquisitions we make from a U.S. perspective. So, this is, as I say, not an exhaustive list, but a lot of investment, a lot of support going into our international growth, and it's certainly responding. We have a long runway ahead. So, with that, I will pass over to Surabhi Pokhriyal. Thank you.
Surabhi Pokhriyal: Thank you, Mike. Good seeing you all today. Introduction, Surabhi Pokhriyal. I lead all things digital ecommerce media and optimization for Church & Dwight. I'm super excited to represent our mighty batch of digital growth team at Church & Dwight. So this is the mighty batch I speak about. This is from our off-site where we were rowing where the U.S. Olympics team rose. That just tells you the kind of caliber we have, not in rowing, but in digital for sure. And we row all in the North Star direction of accelerating e-commerce and media for the organization. This is truly, industry's best of breed talent that we have acquired in the company in recent years. Let's talk business. Matt and Rick both alluded to the percentage of our business that is from e-commerce today. It is 21 point something percent, way up head, shoulders, and torsos, from a lot of our competitors. We are, if not the top tensile, top quartile for sure in all of CPG in terms of e-commerce. I do want to remind that, we are not in the business of calculating how much of our business is from e-commerce. We just are present wherever our consumer is present. And especially after COVID, the convenience of buying online, whether it is your 2 AM melatonin you need, with your last miler, or your cat litter box that needs to be delivered at your front step, the consumer just loves convenience and we are riding that wave and making sure our products show up wherever they need to show up. This is that incredible trajectory. As you look at earnings from our retailers, even you will notice a lot of them have started publicly speaking to the amount of growth they see from ecommerce. So you can connect the dots there of where the retailers are getting bulk of their business and where manufacturers like us are making sure, we are getting a lot of our business as well. Let's talk share. So we have seven power brands that you know of. Four out of the seven power brands have done incredibly well in 2024 where we are not just maintaining, but growing share. I'll speak to the biggest one in particular, ARM & HAMMER Laundry. Laundry is a big part of our Titanic. It contributes a ton to the growth of the organization. So we won online share not just in liquid laundry, but sheets, unit dose, and set boosters. And that speaks a lot, because laundry is typically considered a category that is meant to succeed in bricks-and-mortar. But how we manage share today and just to qualify, online share does not just mean Amazon share for us. It means the target.com, walmart.com, kroger.com, all of that combined is where we are winning in all of these four brands. Aside from the four of seven brands where we are winning in share, 70% of the brands that contribute to 70% of the sales, we are winning in each of them in terms of online share. Some notable ones being Zicam and Nair. THERABREATH, of course, you know how phenomenal THERABREATH and HERO have been to our story. HERO has been a digitally native brand. It's doing much more successful, being much more successful as we gain bigger and bigger bricks-and-mortar distribution. I'll start this section just by re-grounding us in terms of what our approach is. Like I said, we are here in this era of connecting content and commerce. You will note a lot of retailers are trying to seem into trying to be more social and community builders for the community, for the consumers at large. But a lot of social channels also have aspiration to be retailers. The lines are blurring between where is content shown and where is commerce happening, and we want to stay at the intersection of both commerce and content. So that's our priority one. Second, everything is buzzing AI. I'm surprised I'm the first one on sales stage to speak about AI, but I'm sure you are also following a lot of news on this. We want to look at AI, which is not a hammer looking for a nail, but which is clear in terms of what's the business problem or context we are solving and how can AI enable us to that. I'll share a couple of examples, especially in marketing creative. And as you walk the halls, I welcome you guys to have more conversation on that. Lastly, in terms of e-commerce, global footprint, Mike spoke clearly how we are just 18% of our company's business comes from global today, little bit behind where our competition is, and there's a ton of aspiration we have, especially in expanding with respect to e-commerce. I'll share a couple of examples how our new launches are doing amazingly well in every market that we launched. Speaking to our first pillar with respect to content and commerce, you are super familiar how social has become what I called the third shelf of discovery, there's a physical shelf in store, there's a digital shelf that you go online and try to shop and socialists sometimes you're not even trying to shop, but you do a lot of serendipity 2:00 AM kind of shopping on social. So we are there at that moment of truth where the consumer discovers us why she's doing the endless scroll. We are super intentional about making sure we partner with both micro and key opinion leaders, influencers who impact how consumers make their decisions today. You'll see a couple of examples here, be it the Alex Edgar or Suni Lee, the Olympic gymnast, and a lot of live streaming shopping that we have been doing in China for years now. The notable thing to see here is not just that over 10 of our brands have the highest number of video views on TikTok across all categories we operate in, but it's not just about views and followership. A lot of our content has industry leading engagement rate and what engagement rate means is our -- the consumers are not just liking and following our brands, they're commenting on our posts, they're sharing our posts, they're interacting and building community with us. So that's super meaningful for us, because that's the long-term loyalty and intimacy that we want to create with our consumers. Second, we are super careful that we don't want to leave media as a dead end, we want to make sure that once the consumer is inspired by seeing an ad spot, either on TV or TikTok, there's an ability for them to shop our products. So we are making sure that over 90% of every media that you see, be it YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, or anywhere else, we will lead you to a cart in one to two clicks if you have the desire to shop our products. This is an example of one of the AI initiatives we are leading. There's the concept of aspect ratio, you can shop on your six inch mobile phone, but you can also shop on your 60 inch television. AI is helping us make sure that creative is conducted in a way that there is less human touch involved and making sure that creative is valid, both for the six inch screen and the 60 inch screen. So you'll see couple of snippets here, both for ARM & HAMMER, and our partners like TikTok and Google make sure that they grade us to tell us how we are performing with respect to their expectations on showing up creative really well. So AI is super important, not just in terms of showing up well on social creative. We also know that as the consumers shop for us online, you spend no more than five seconds in our kind of what I call low consideration categories. So if you land on an Amazon or a walmart.com page, we have to make sure that the five seconds you spend looking for ARM & HAMMER or laundry sheets, we make the right first impression on you that you are inspired to add us to the cart. So look at these examples. The score at the bottom left goes from 18.5% to 87.4%. All that means is this is AI helping us do eyeball tracking on lookalike audiences to make sure that the creative we put out has the maximum eyeballs on it in that five second time on the retailer PDP. And this has done wonders for us, because the more the creative is sticky, the higher chances are that the consumer converts and buys the product. Finally, speaking to the global footprint, Mike spoke eloquently to it. THERABREATH, Mighty Patch HERO, and Power Sheets have done a lot for us. These are what I call category disruptors and even category creators. We launched them in markets where there were no sheets existed and no acne patches existed. And within 6 to 12 months, they ranked number one spot in several online retailers. THERABREATH in particular, you'll notice an interesting retailer here. Not many might be familiar, but Olive Young in Korea is the number one beauty retailer where THERABREATH quickly garnered a spot one. Similarly, Mighty Patch across France, Germany, Mexico became number one really, really quickly. So, our products travel well literally, quite literally. Finally, I'll wrap it up by saying our pace of growth on digital has been quite phenomenal, industry leading truly, but we are very focused on being clear about where to play and how to win on that. We have industry leading ecommerce growth, but we are in aspiration and in true form making it as profitable as we can. So, we are very choiceful about what we sell online, when we sell online, and where we sell online. We have unprecedented online market share today we are on track to keep growing it. We are also super conscious about best ROI on our media spend. I may not have mentioned, but about 82% of our marketing dollars today are digital media, which is why you see all the media there, and we struggle to give you TV, print spots that we used to have back in the past. So, we have to print them especially for these kind of events. So, we have to make sure that our retail our media dollars stretch the highest so the return on investment of that is super critical for us. In terms of category leadership and digital penetration, like I said having rapid market launches like we did for HERO, THERABREATH, and Sheets is critical, and launching them online first gives us early dibs into what the consumer is feeling and gives us an opportunity to tweak them as needed as we do broader brick and mortar launches in those markets. We'll do a lot more on AI and technology, both in martech and adtech, and we lean on both large and smaller third party technology partnerships, and that's one big area of impetus for us in the coming years. I'll close by saying, the best way to predict the future is to create it and we are hard at it. Along those lines, there's a big business pivot we have in Specialty Products Division and I welcome Shitij Chabba to share more on that turnaround story. Thank you.
Shitij Chabba: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Shitij. I'm the leader for our Specialty Products Division. It's really my honor and excitement to share with you the B2B arm of the company because for many of you, it may be a question, why does a CPG company even have SPD? And I want to show you what we are doing and how we are contributing to the growth of the company, and how we'll keep growing and be a growth accelerator for the overall organization. As you all know, our evergreen growth model target is 5%, so let's see how we did last year. Last year as a division, we delivered over $300 million in revenue. It's split 60% on our animal nutrition business, and roughly 40% under our Specialty Chemicals division. But let's take a moment to look under the hood, what really is SPD, Specialty Products Division. Specialty Products Division has three businesses. The largest business we have is animal nutrition. I can ask you around how did Church & Dwight enter animal nutrition. It's very, very simple. You know we sell ARM & HAMMER, hopefully all of you are a user of our ARM & HAMMER, which is the baking soda, you see samples here. Chemically, that's sodium bicarbonate. That same sodium bicarbonate, the company started feeding many, many decades ago to dairy cows. It helps with food digestion as well as better milk production. That's how we entered the world of animal nutrition. And now you fast forward, we are manufacturing both feed supplements, marketing and selling, but also pre and probiotics. Now there are lots of companies that say they sell probiotics. So, what's special about us? We are truly unique. What we do, you can buy -- if you're running a dairy operations or a poultry farm, you can buy probiotics. Everybody will ship you in a bag and that's their probiotic sample. But what we do, we go to your operation. Let's say you're running a dairy farm. We'll come to your operation, we collect samples, we send those samples to our lab in Wisconsin, where our scientists analyze those samples, run it against our library of probiotics. We have over 82,000 probiotic streams. And then, we match that for your unique need and create a truly customized solution. And we sell that under our CERTILLUS brand. It's a great product that we are very, very proud of, and you're going to see more about it. Our second biggest business is performance product. This truly is the core of the company. Performance product is where we sell, again, ARM & HAMMER sodium bicarbonate. Remember the same baking soda I talked about? It's where are we selling it? Instead of selling in the half pound bag or a pound bag that you buy, or you may buy at large, box chains with 5 pound, we sell at 50 pound bags like you see on the screen here, or maybe up to a 1000 kilo tote. We're selling it for large B2B application. Industrial, pool, but even lifesaving application like hemodialysis. So it's truly amazing what sodium bicarbonate can do and the number of application it has. The third business that you may not have heard a lot about is our B2B business. This is where we take all the amazing brand the company has, Search and Write, we customize their packaging, and we sell them for commercial and professional applications in different channels. From Janssen, food services, hospitality. It's small, but I'm confident this business is poised for growth, and you'll hear a lot more about, not just today, but in coming years from us. SPD, I joined the company roughly two years back. And when I came and I analyzed the results, as you can see, we have had inconsistent performance. So one of the very first thing we did, as a leadership team, we looked at it and we said, what's our strategy going forward? We created a new vision for SPD, and we launched a new strategy called SPD Reimagined. So I'm very excited to say that, if you look at our results from last year after launching the strategy, we had an amazing turnaround. We went from negative 8% in 2023 to plus 7% organic sales growth in 2024. Now how did we do that? As I said, we have an amazing group, we have a very talented team of individuals, but we did core pillars in our strategy. First, we divested the non-strategic, non-core assets. I think you heard about we shut down our MegaLac, which was a dairy supplement business in Q1, we exited our food safety business in Q2. And what did that do? That allowed us to focus on portfolio optimization. Simply put, across the three businesses, we could focus on brands that drive profitability and channels, where we can do more higher profitable growth. And that really helped us. Then next we shift to just like the broader company you heard from Mike, international. International is a huge growth opportunity for SPD. And we are focusing on key countries, both in Eurasia, as well as Latin America. Last year, actually, we hired new sales leader, both for our Latin America business and for our Eurasia business. So we're very excited, the results we're seeing from that. And then we invested in marketing and innovation acceleration. And you'll say, what did you invest? Again, when I joined, I was very surprised to see that, we are part of a CPG company, and we had no in house marketing, right? You heard from Stacey, our CMO. So just like marketing is core for CPG, it's essential for B2B business also, from both the right brand messaging, brand positioning, and doing the omni-channel marketing, because the B2B customers are everywhere just like we are. And what did that do? Here's a great example I'm excited to share. We launched our CERTILLUS, remember the probiotic I talked about the customized probiotic. We launched two new products last year called them HatchWell and Newell. So what are these products? So we have as I said, over 80,000 strains of probiotics. Our scientists and our technical service team identified one of our poultry operators were having issues where the poultry chicken, they were dealing with mobility issues. The chicken couldn't walk to get the water and the food where it is. And guess what this was called. Before our marketing team, this product was called CERTILLUS Enterococcus cecorum something. So you all needed to be a PhD to understand what this product is. And this is where we rebranded it and we said, well, what does it do? Move well, even I get it when you hear the word move well, it's your chicken can move well, it can have a better quality of life. And our production partners, they have higher productivity. Both these products HatchWell and Newell have been great success for us. And we are seeing a lot of engagement for our customers that is helping us grow again with our innovation acceleration and our portfolio optimization. International. International, we have a huge runway of growth. Last year we grew 7% and now international represent 28% of our sales in our animal nutrition business. But we have gained, we are continuing our product registration for our pre and probiotics. So CERTILLUS CEL-MAX, A-MAX our brands and just last year alone, we added 15 new countries. So we are rapidly expanding where we are going to enter with these countries and keep growing hopefully much stronger than the average market growth rate. So to summarize, I'm very excited, hopefully you can hear that that SPD is going to be as Matt said, perennial growth driver. We are going to keep driving 5% based on these pillars. We are focusing on the right brands that will drive the portfolio optimization. International is a key and we are excited about the growth we are seeing there and building on the whole strong marketing team that we have created and innovation acceleration. So it's going to really lead the way. With that, I'll pass it back to our CEO, Matt Farrell.
Matt Farrell: Thank you. Many of you know I've been with the company for 18 years and the one thing that's remarkable about Church & Dwight is its consistency and maybe wonder how does that actually happen? And what we're known for is execution. And what that means is we do what we say we're going to do. That's the difference between a company that consistently successful and one that is not. So you come to, there's lots of analogies between sports and business people roll their eyes when they hear them. But one thing that is true is that the teams that have the best players win. So when you're investing, you're investing in people. This Analyst Day, it's the one time a year you get a peak under the hood. You see some of the leaders of the company and they come up and kind of talk. I have the pleasure of working with these people every day. We have exceptional leadership in this company. These are understated people, low ego, massive technical skill. And it's not just at the top, it's throughout our plants, it's in our laboratories, it's in our sales offices, it's throughout the company. And a lot of companies will say things like that and you kind of -- you'll be checking your watch or looking at your phone. But if you're trying to figure out why is this company so successful for so long, that's it, it's the culture of this company, the kind of people we attract, the kind of people we recruit to the company. And many of I'm going to be leaving here in April, 1, April fool’s Day. And, but this company is in such great shape, starting at the top with Rick and the management team that you're seeing here today and the strength that we have throughout the company. So, it's a good time for me to walk off the field. So, I'm going to move on now to, how we run the company. If you've owned the stock for a long time, you can check your phone right now. But we have five operating principles, right? You've heard this before. And that's the thing about Church & Dwight. Many of the things you hear from us, you've heard last year, the year before. You hear it down here at the Stock Exchange. You hear it at CAGNY. That's because we have an operating model, and we stick to it, and we execute it. Again, back to do you do what you say you're going to do. It's a personal commitment that we feel, not to the company and to each other. We say this is what we're going to pull off this coming year. So, you heard a lot about our brands, about leveraging our brands. We got great brands around the world. Second thing is friend of the environment. A little bit about that, that's very important to, not to just to our employees, but it's also important to our consumers. It's important to our retailers. And we have a long heritage and we're really proud of, starting back in 19th century. You've heard me talk about bird cards before. I'm going to show one of them in a minute. But, I always take a little bit of time to talk about our heritage here. You know, if you look at early 20th century, we were using recycled paper. We were the 1st to take phosphates out of out of liquid laundry detergent. We've been planting trees since 2017. We planted millions of trees that take CO2 out of the atmosphere. Remember all that from 5 grade, right? Photosynthesis. And a 100% of our global electricity is offset by, green energy. And then we started we signed up for science based targets so we have these, projects to take CO2, out of the atmosphere because we use a lot of CO2 when we're making baking soda. Here's one of those bird cards that we used to put in our in our yellow boxes. And if you can I don't know if you can read it very well, but it says useful birds of America, and at the very bottom, it says for the good of all, do not destroy the birds. And for those of you who are interested, you can still buy these. These are the original bird cards. They're available on eBay. So, buy now. This is not an advertisement for eBay. I just want to tell you. I know many of you are very enthusiastic about the ARM & HAMMER brand. It's just something you want to look into. All right. ESG, everybody gets measured on ESG. You can see we got great scores consistently ‘22, ‘23, ‘24. Third thing to talk about is leverage people. We have a really lean shop. We've always had a really lean shop. Why is that important? It's because it forces you to prioritize. You only work on the stuff that matters. So, consequently, we have the highest revenue for per employee of any of our peer group. So, we got $6 billion in sales. We got 5,500 employees. So, we got over $1 million of sales per employee. And, as Surabhi took us through, we're world class when it comes to e-commerce. And we got there because we put our minds to it. We knew we were bottom of the barrel in 2016 and now we're ahead of the pack. We really believe in a simple compensation structure so everybody kind of knows where they are at all times. We don't get involved with EVA or some of the other these complicated esoteric measurements. Is straight up net revenue, gross margin, cash, EPS, and strategic initiatives, 20% each, and it's unusual for a company to have gross margin as part of incentive comp. What that does is promote financial literacy. When it's going to hit your pocketbook, you're going to say, hey, what is gross margin? How do I get it? And that's just going to galvanize as a company. And the ways we get it, good to great, we like to joke within the company. This is the book everybody's heard about but nobody's read. But that is the name of our continuous improvement program. Supply chain is our bedrock when it comes to finding ways to save money. New products, we try to launch new products that have a higher gross margin than the ones that we're replacing. And then when we buy a business, we try to find a way to grow expand our gross margins as well. Now you've heard us talk about being asset light. That's very, very true. We want to buy businesses that don't have plants. But for a long period of time, our average CapEx or percentage of sales is 2%. And the other thing to keep in mind too is about it's close to 30% of our finished products right now are made by third-parties. So that also helps continue to be asset light. Finally, leverage on acquisitions. You do those first four right, you get good returns. If you're good at acquisitions, which we are, which Rick took you through earlier, we're good at identifying, targeting, acquiring and integrating. And you can blow it on any one of those three. You pay too much, you don't integrate it, a disaster can happen. All right. You've seen this slide before, long history, going to be a bit of a drought, '23, '24, but not for lack of trying. And now Rick is going to come up and take you through the 2025 outlook.
Rick Dierker: All right. So let's turn to the 2025 outlook. We announced today that we're going to have a top-line expectation of 3% to 4% organic, 25 basis points for gross margin expansion. You'll hear, we have a little bit higher than historical inflation, more like 3% versus 2%. Marketing, 11% plus, probably in the range of 11% to 11.4%. So it's incremental because we're driving share gains, leverage SG&A and 7% to 8% EPS growth. And we expect to generate again $1.1 billion or so of cash flow, CFO. So we have a long track record of this growth. 2.5% to 3.5% is our outlook. But if you look at the track record, it's 6%. Why is that? It's M&A. We historically also do M&A. Organically, expectations 3% to 4%, 10 year average is 4%. And that 3% to 4% is largely volume driven, and that's, been the case for not just one year or two years, but for over a decade. It's our history. It's volume-driven growth. I mentioned this earlier. Gross margin expansion, in 2025, 25 basis points, it gets us right back to 2019 levels. We believe we have more room to run as we have this productivity program that's a muscle. Similar to how Carlos described the NPD and innovation process, it's analogous to how we do productivity. And we also have some fast-growing acquisitions that have higher than corporate margins. Speaking of margin, I'll talk about 2025 really quick. Volume and mix largely give you a little bit of a benefit of 30 basis points is our expectation. A drag of 150 basis points and then offset by a large degree to productivity. That's what gets us to the 25 of expansion. And costs, I mentioned this earlier, but, it's probably 40% or so from a commodity-based perspective, and that's ethylene and resins are up and natural gas is up. But more so, it's also depreciation for new capacity. It's putting in new 3PL in the Northeast. It's other higher costs for our partners, co-packers, as Matt mentioned. Marketing spend, 11% plus is the expectation in 2025. And then SG&A is leverage. Leverage while making investments to for what matters in terms of building capabilities, e-com, international. And then we've had a long track record of high single-digit or even double-digit EPS growth, and we expect 7% to 9% or 7% to 8% in 2025. And we put this in the release as well. There is some phasing, right? We're supporting some innovation with market in the front of the year. We have a little bit higher revenue growth in the back part of the year. And so that's why there's a little bit more fees growth in the second half. This is my favorite slide as a CFO and it's probably still going to be one of the favorite slides in the future. And why is that? It enables us to do a lot of things. 115% free cash flow conversion means we can go do capital allocation, right? Cash flow matters more than most. And we get there a few different ways, but one of the ways we get there is we have a strong, tight way we manage working capital. We've gone from 52 days down into the 20s. We expect this to further improve as we look forward. And our balance sheet has never been stronger, 1.5x debt to EBITDA. And that means we have -- this is the highest number we've ever had on this page, too, over $6 billion of firepower. This is dry powder do M&A. This is fantastic. And this leads to whether is our use of free cash flow. What's our capital allocation? Well, number one is M&A. Because we haven't done a deal in the last 12 months or 24 months, doesn't mean we're not in really hard at looking at deals. And I would tell you that the ELT spends a lot of their time looking for the right deal. The number one value-creating opportunity is looking for the next business or brand to buy, but we're going to be picky and fussy as we go through that process. Number two is CapEx. Number three is NPD. Number four is debt reduction, although that's hard to do when you've prepaid all your debt. And so now we just have fixed debt. And so we're waiting for a great acquisition to go borrow some more 1 day and then return cash to shareholders. Matt covered this. This is -- we're not a capital-intensive company. This matters when you look at free cash flow conversion. And then finally, dividend increase, a long track record. I don't know what's longer than long, but 124 years is decades, a century or more of paying a dividend, credibility, consistency. That's what Church & Dwight is nowhere. Now before I ask everybody to come up, I do want to acknowledge that we have a huge amount of confidence in our future, okay? And you heard it from each person today. Whether it was Mike on International, Surabhi on Digital, I talked to the U.S. business, I talked about our outlook for M&A. And the nuance there is just not in the U.S. We're looking at M&A both domestically and international. A year ago, when Brian was here who happens to be sick today, we told you that his team increased by 300%, right? So he went from 1 person to 4 people. So we have people in Europe. We have people in Singapore and Asia. So the focus on live and well. I also want to acknowledge Matt. And Matt has been here for 18 years, right? And we just did a quick montage of New York Stock Exchange. He embodies the culture of this company, okay? We are where we are because of Matt Farrell to a large degree. Like you just heard him talk about people, you just talked -- heard him talk about leadership. We are unique and different and Matt is a big reason why. Here's a quick look back. So [Management Company] back in 2006, a $2 billion revenue company. Now it's a $6 billion on. Market cap was $3 billion. Now we're $26 billion. But more than that, he's added capabilities, right? Capabilities like e-com, like pricing, things that we do that we take for granted. One of the great things about our culture, we're not insular. If there's something that we see that we think we can go after. We're going to run as fast as we can with speed and urgency in order to execute it. A lot of that, again, Matt certainly did that. So with that, I'll invite everybody else up, and we'll take questions.
Q - Rupesh Parikh : So maybe just starting with the Vitamin business, a lot of enthusiasm on the innovation. And I know I think you had a year with a double-digit decline. So how are you thinking about the Vitamin business from this year?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So the vitamin business is one where -- look, like I said in the comments, we really did break glass. We're moving with -- these aren't little eye innovations, these are big eye innovations in our opinion. So we're going to put the whole full force of the company behind that to long them the right way. Our new CMO Stacey's right with our leader, Bruce, to really make sure that we're telling the consumer the real core benefit again. So look, do we think the business is likely going to decline a little bit for a little longer? Yes, we do. But what we want to see is an inflection point. And these innovations are going to help give us that confidence for an inflection point.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe my one follow-up question. Just on HERO. So you're in 40 countries going to 50 countries. Just curious if anything surprised you? And then as you look at consumption growth within international markets, like how that's trending versus your expectation?
Rick Dierker: I would just say HERO has been a fantastic brand in the U.S. And as Mike alluded to, he have to go out -- it usually takes us 2 years, 2 to 3 years to roll out a brand from the U.S. acquisition to our international, but to do this within such a short time to be in 40 countries, it's fantastic. Mike, do you want to talk about some of the opportunities?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I'd say what we saw in the U.S. and what we're seeing internationally is the same story. So what I would say is, early on, we got to our subsidiary markets, not all of them, depending on registration timing. But those markets that we've entered, we're already in number 1 positions in patches really quickly, in some cases, already number 1 in acne. And that's just with the sort of the core suite of introductory SKUs. We haven't even tapped into the innovation pipeline yet. So many of the 40 countries that we've talked about, are those are really early days. We're seeing really strong excitement and really good takeaway off shelf. So the consumption rate is where we expect it to be actually much further than that, and that's before we've introduced NPD.
Rick Dierker: I would tell you a quick story, Rupesh. I've been traveling on a lot with Mike, and we have brand camps all over the world. And we have one in Vietnam. We had one in South America, I think in the Dominican, pontoon. Yes. And the distributor for South Africa was there, and he was one of the first to launch. And he was giving just case studies, after case studies on HERO to all these other countries because it was -- he represents many other companies as well, number 1 SKU by far, across all the companies that it represents. So I think that little microcosm is going to play itself out in many countries. Yes, Dara?
Dara Mohsenian: So Rick, Matt spent a lot of time talking about the organization is in a great place, but there's always a chance under new leadership to refocus in specific areas or emphasize different areas. I'm just curious, any initial thoughts under your leadership as to maybe where you'll double down on or areas you emphasize more? And then also just a specific question on the VITAFUSION side, given all this great innovation versus a tough couple of years, do you expect to gain shelf space this year at retail? When does that sort of play out in terms of how you think about shelf space for the brand?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So I'll take the second one first, and then Carlen has anything to add as well. Look, when the business isn't decline, you're not going to go game shelf space, right? So we got to make sure we have inflection points, and then we can go to the sell-in. We got to show the retailer our strategy, right? And then we can go ask for more shelf space. But -- so I don't expect to gain any more shelf space in vitamins. Anything you would add?
Carlen Hooker : I would say we're -- definitely an inflection point. So we've got to get the credibility, build that back up. We had some great relationships with the retailers. So they're in it for the long game with us. So --
Rick Dierker: Yes. So what would I do -- what would I double down on or different? Look, our strategy is working extremely well. We have a long track record of just fantastic growth in building capabilities, M&A, everything. Two or three things come to mind. This is iterative. But I would say not because it's me, but because it's the right time, our international investment and our international growth. I thought Mike did a great job showing how we have these big aspirations, and we are under-indexed to the peer group. So that's one. We're going to continue down that path. Number two, I would say, there are bigger bets. Carlen just walked you through how we innovate and Stacey talked about what we innovate. There are bigger bets to be made on innovation. Like too often, I think companies of our size and bigger don't put enough ships behind when we believe there's a needle moving innovation, we should get behind it in a bigger way. So we're going to try that, right? And then maybe third is there are a handful of brands that we own. We own 80 brands. There's a handful of brands in my opinion, and then we're going to work through this as a team on which ones they are that they could be bigger. But they are poised for more success. But stay tuned on that one. Yes, Andrea?
Andrea Teixeira: Congrats for you, again, on the new chapter. So just thinking of like the appropriate, like a lot of has been in CPG thought about the appropriate level of investment and given that you are correctly branching out to more categories or in a way, a lot of more international. Is 11% appropriate as it was in the Evergreen model up until the lever that you are now? And then I have a question on M&A. What is the -- what are the capabilities that you want capabilities or categories that would rather have developed by externally or internally?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So on the marketing investment, I care less about 11% or 11.2% or 11.4%. I care the most about how our shares are doing. Shares are the marketing investments in the input, the scorecard is a share we're doing. If you look back at our track record, it happens to be that we've spent between 10.5%, 11.5% more often than not, and our shares are healthy and gaining more often than not. So my scorecard is shares. 11.4% how we ended the year, 11%, 11.2% to 11.5%, all those numbers are interesting, but it's healthy. Some brands we spend in the 20s. Some brands, we spend 5%, but it kind of matters for that brand, either it's a household, personal care, it's different. So that's that one. M&A. M&A, Andrea, we don't ever go look at a category. That's just not how we work, right? We can only buy what's for sale. And so we become -- this is the team that becomes rapid experts when we go find a deal to look at. And we've probably spent hundreds of this team's time, hundreds of hours on due diligence this year. And more often that we're walking away because of a category dynamic that we learned about, high exposure to private label or a company has a claim that they can make that is only a matter of time before they get in trouble for making that claim. And so we go do all that research after the fact. Capability building. I really like as an example, what HERO did for us, HERO’s, digital proudness in terms of content creation, their speed and urgency to go test and bring innovation. But I don't know if Surabhi or Carlen, if you guys want to talk about like HERO capability or what acquisitions could do for us and capabilities?
Surabhi Pokhriyal: I'll add to what Rick was saying, right? Just a small anecdote. The average age of the HERO employee when we acquired them was between 25 to 28, that just tells you the amount of time and the amount of the amount of background expertise they have that is more social and digitally savvy than the typical talent we had. So that's the kind of injection of talent we had through HERO, and we percolated that through the ecosystem. And similarly, we have similar things on GNP that Carlen can speak on.
Carlen Hooker : Yes. Well, very quickly on HERO -- I think every acquisition -- and certainly from the speed, the innovation and the partnership. They've got very strong partners outside that took them a long time to get there, and we've continued to leverage it. So we maintain that for the acquisition and that we leverage it across other brands as appropriate.
Matt Farrell: I want to add something to that. I was at a party on Brooklyn last night. And HERO has a little party June were January summer and winter. And I think one of the things we've learned on credit to Stacey, who managed the HERO integration. One of the things we learned over the last few years is how to interact and integrate a business with a very different culture in Church & Dwight with startup. That's almost a virtual business with really world-class digital marketers. How do you preserve that? And 2 of the 3 founders were there last night too and Andy. And they helped us preserve the magic. And I think a lot of companies struggle with doing that. So we learned a lot from that over the last few years. And I think that positions us well than in the future to also acquire startups.
Rick Dierker: Chris?
Chris Carey: Can I just ask about category growth going into 2025? I think sitting here a year ago, you established 4% evergreen target. The outlook for this year, 3% to 4%. What are you embedding from a category growth perspective? Is that a little bit different from how you sell the world a year ago? I would assume, yes. You also talked about dry powder to respond to competitive activity, I think, over the summer, going into the back half of the year. So just in the context of this category growth dynamic, the outlook for '25, what you had said about competitive activity, but we haven't really heard about that. How do all these things fit together in your view over the next 12 months and, I guess, sanctity of 4% and how flexible that is?
Rick Dierker: Everyone on the clock a year ago. Remember, we said January through May categories, it's not us categories were growing 4.5%, right? That's kind of a different window from where we are right now. But categories were off and running. Then in the summer, we said categories in general were growing closer to 2.5%. That's what happened for the balance of the year, 2.5%. And you just saw the category up and overall categories grew 2.7%. I would say our fundamental baseline of understanding is categories are going to grow around that 2.5% growth next year. And we're going to continue to take share, and that's how we get to a range of whatever it is. It could be better, it could be worse, but that's why we gave you a range of 3% to 4%. . From a notional perspective, I would say actually, laundry is a good example, but laundry is pretty consistent as you look sequentially, a bit litters up a little bit, others driven by a competitor who's still trying to get some of their share back. Happy to say that we kept over 50% of our share a year ago when that issue happened for them. So really happy where we ended up. So promotional levels are back normal is what I would say from the pre-COVID perspective and all that mixes in. That's why we gave you a range 3% to 4%. And if categories do better, we'll do better. If our shares do better, we could do well also. Anything you'd add?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I'm sort of the old and the macro environmental guy. So when we look at the U.S. consumer, we may have a different point of view than maybe some of the larger peers. And we don't think anything's changed. We think that prices on shelf are high. Wages have not kept up with price increases. And that's just CPG, it's food, beverage. We're all reading about the cost of rent, cost of insurance going up. We ran in the last couple of days that consumer confidence has declined a little bit. And interest rate is still high. So we'd say things really haven't changed from our point of view earlier in 2024, and we said, "Hey, we see an inflection. We think things are turning down a bit." And we think all those arrows and things that we considered when we said that are still in place. So that's why we said, hey, this makes sense to call 3% to 4% top line for '25.
Rick Dierker: Peter?
Peter Grom: Maybe just to follow-up on that, just kind of the phasing of the growth, right? So 1Q, 2% organic sales growth, pretty decent step down from what you just delivered in the fourth quarter, and the data that we can see it doesn't look like that's kind of playing out. So what's really driving that? Are you just being conservative? Is there something we can't see? And then just kind of a follow on to the Chris’ point just on the phasing, right given a 2% start, 3% to 4% for the year, what kind of gets better from 1Q? Or are you assuming the category kind of reaccelerate as you kind of cycle easier comparisons? Or is there something else that's driving that?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I would probably simplify to say there's 2 things. One is our International business, the GMG [indiscernible] a little lumpy sometimes it's historically speaking, but it's going to be a little bit lighter in Q1. It will be a little bit heavier in other quarters. I would also say there were some club promotions that move around between Q1, 2 and 3. So that stuff is kind of normal. It's all an untracked channel. So you're not going to see as much, but that's a simple answer.
Unidentified Analyst: I just wanted to focus more on HERO and THERABREATH. Maybe I can add it in a different way on the international opportunity for HERO. Is this kind of like basically, should we think about it in a similar way to how the U.S. market was a few years ago? Or are there more formidable competitors in those local markets where you're expanding? And then on THERABREATH, you mentioned significantly more household penetration as possible. So I was wondering if you have a better breakdown there of maybe the 0 alcohol mouthwash opportunity versus the alcohol mouthwash opportunity there?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Mike, do you want to talk some more about HERO.
Mike Read: Yes. So just on balance across international, we're seeing a very similar play out for the brand across most markets. There's no question there's different levels of competitive intensity, particularly more in the Far East, where a lot of the patches kind of were born. So there's more competition there. But we're broken in quite successfully there. We have a really strong brand. We have really strong assets, and we have a really strong pipeline. And so early indication is we'll be able to compete quite successfully there. But certainly, as we've entered markets were the introductory patch, we're able to kind of gain a lot of share and a lot of momentum really quickly this be different competitive landscape market by market, but really confident in the brand and the pipeline.
Rick Dierker: Yes. On the mouthwash side of it, I understand the nation of alcohol-free and alcohol. I think we're starting to think about it a little bit differently now, right? But sometimes when we do deals and you convince yourself that you're number 1 or number 2 brand in a segment of a sub-segment, we're saying we're the number 2 overall player now. And so we believe we can play in all aspects of the entire category and do well and gain share and drive household penetration.
Matt Farrell: Here's a little bit of some numbers because we're maniacal about numbers. Mouthwash grew 3%. And but you look at alcohol and non-alcohol, so non-alcohol growing 7% and alcohols down 1%, that's the math. So it all the growth is on the non-alcohol side and that's where we sit and that's where the category is growing.
Unidentified Analyst: Congrats to both of you. I wanted to talk about gross margin a little bit and a more muted gross margin expansion target for this year. Can you talk about the building what's there? Seems like a lot of the innovation is more premium end. So what are the offsets that's holding back further expansion, particularly since it's part of the comp structure? And it's not material for you, but have you assumed more headwind from tariffs? It just came across the wires that it's 25% Canada, Mexico, 10% China. So if you could talk about maneuvers to offset that that would be great.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So -- in terms of supply chain and gross margin, gross margin expanding 25 basis points in the face of higher-than-normal inflation, we think is really good. So remember, historical inflation for us is 2%. You can go back for a decade or longer and see that. Then COVID happened and it got a lot choppier. So the -- yes, innovation is premium. Yes, we have fast-growing businesses at a higher margin, but this headwind is still inflation. And it's moderate inflation is the word we used and I think the release and elsewhere. So we're doing really, in my mind, a really good job by offsetting inflation with productivity. Our productivity program is running on all cylinders. Carlen, would you guys want to talk about anything from a cost perspective that you want to highlight?
Carlen Hooker : Yes. So just from an input cost standpoint, the inflation we're seeing is largely on a -- from a commodity standpoint on ethylene, which impacts high-density polyethylene for us, post-consumer regrind as well. Natural gas is up. So those were headwinds that we had. But as Rick referenced, our productivity program is alive and well and more productive than it ever has been. We had a fantastic year last year.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And then your second question really on tariffs. Tariffs are -- we've been moving for years to limit our exposure, right? And we've set our outlook excludes any impact from tariffs. As many competitors would say the same. And we are less exposed than others is what I would kind of handicap. We're going to continue to focus on local manufacturing we can and do things with productivity to offset as best we can. And we'll see -- these are volatile situations, so we'll see how long it lasts and what happens, but we have a culture and a capability to be reactive and we need to be.
Unidentified Analyst: If you could expand in 2 categories, again, vitamin, sorry about that one, but hopefully, from a different angle, to what extent what is happening in drug stores has been incorporated into this repositioning or upgrade of the business. A lot of the category is now in online, not drug stores. And to what extent private-label from the drug store point of view is making the whole thing more difficult given the struggles of the channel. So that's point one. The other is on the [indiscernible] how important is it that now you kind of like finally crack kind of like a best or the mid-tier? So I think that you tried before, now you have it. It seems that it's getting a lot of traction. Does it translate into more shop space, this is a big category if you can expand how important it is strategically that your largest category you seem to have breakthrough?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I mean, ARM & HAMMER laundry, I'll start with that one, good, better, best situation. And we are extremely pleased. You know our history. You know that we try to launch OXICLEAN into premium detergent. It didn't work. There is consumer confusion on the brand to be additive versus a laundry. ARM & HAMMER, there's no confusion at all. And the incrementality is better than we expected. So when you hear Carlos talk about, we have a high bar for our NPD, incremental net sales. It's not a gross amount. It's not how much it sells. It's the incremental net cannibalization. And that is beating all of our metrics on incrementality. So it is working. The consumer is really pleased. Our reviews are really strong. Carlen anything you would add on just your assessment of Deep Clean and the acceptance?
Carlen Hooker: Yes. I think on the laundry side, with Deep Clean, we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing. The retailers are pleased as well. So this was a piece of innovation that we worked for quite a while on. It wasn't just us developing and taking it in. So we were very collaborative in how we approached it. And I think the consumers are definitely speaking in terms of where we're picking up the incrementality piece probably to a greater extent than we even expected.
Rick Dierker: And then, Javier, really your second question is around the vitamin. And I can't go into a lot of detail here, but I would just tell you, our strategy has applicable to classes of trade that we play in. It's applicable to what segments we play in. And part of it is definitely the online strategy as well. Half of all vitamins are sold online. 1/3 of all gummies are sold online. And so to win in the category, you can't just look at bricks and mortar and so kind data really have to be a little more broad than that. And that is a big future for the gumming business is what we do online. . Steve Powers?
Steve Powers: Two questions, if I could. The first one, just to kick the tires a little bit on the ERP upgrade that you called out in the release. I'm assuming those costs are cash, just clarify that. And then any risks or timing that, that may impact on sales cadence throughout the year as that rolls through? And then the second question is actually for Carlos. I don't know if there's way to do this, but maybe of all the innovations that Stacey laid out for us for the first half, are there 1 or 2 that you would highlight that sort of you use the case study that says just exemplify the new product development and kind of highlight capabilities that exists today that maybe you couldn't have brought that product to life 5, 6, 7 years ago?
Rick Dierker: So on the ERP upgrade, no revenue recognition issues in 2025. That project won't go live until Q1, Q2 of 2026. So Kevin, anything you want to add on SAP and the ERP system?
Unidentified Company Representative : No, the SAP system is the lifeblood of our operation, and it's what enables a lot of what we heard about today. Technology drives our ability to acquire and grow.
Rick Dierker: Carlos?
Carlos Linares : Yes. We talked a little bit about BATISTE. I talked about how we got there. So to be on. But I think kind of at Blue Box is the upper right, that's what we get excited about. I mean, Hardball is another example, but the litter that's extruded sorghum. It's not the clays that are typical in this category. So that's a great example of open innovation. We went outside found the partner that had the technology. We needed to change it and adapt it reports added our expertise on top of that, some of the aesthetics and fragrance work. And the other example is, it's really -- it was about grains. And again, that team was used to dealing with play, but we've got food people. We've got food nutrition in the building that say, okay, we know how to technically extrude grains and put those together. So it's identifying it, bringing it up and then and matching some of these things together. So it's almost like that number I threw out the 50%. Everything has got a little bit of a story and sometimes, frankly, -- it's hard to pinpoint the innovation sources as why the innovation worked and they kind of come together. So I think those are 2 and you can go down the listing. The Sheets -- we talk about Sheets as a first branded product out there with Sheets. But we were doing that internally and a lot of like design thinking and working with the consumer directly. And they just kind of led us to that form. So that's another skill set of doing R&D work with design thinking with a consumer that got us to a form that is really delightful for them. .
Rick Dierker: Bonnie?
Bonnie Herzog: I just wanted to ask about international. Rick, you sounded very excited about the growth and the opportunities there. So hoping for a little more color on the differences of growth that you're seeing in Global Markets group versus the subsidiaries? And then maybe where you see the most upside? And then a second part of this is, as you think about expanding and getting into new markets, how do you evaluate the risk getting into some of these new markets and opening them and any learnings that you've had from past and what you're doing maybe differently and doing better?
Rick Dierker: Yes. All right. Well, you read me right. I'm excited about it. And it's broad-based. It's geography and in the country we go into, the brands that we're bringing, some brands that we're going global with. OXICLEAN is an example that Mike gave in the deck, and I thought it was a really good one. The distributor that we bought in Japan, there's other countries just like that story that will play out in my mind over the next 5 years. And it's all about we're probably 20 years behind most CPG companies on their way. And you can get there if you have great brand portfolio like we do, like we get a lot of acceptance when we go to a country when we have a new news, new brand for a retailer. But that's also why we put M&A hit there on the list for international. Like for the first time ever, we're going to say, yes, you know what, we buy incrementality. We want to buy some brands and build that capability in other countries. So Mike, anything you want to add?
Mike Read: Yes. What I'd say is, I think from our current position is we're encouraged because we've got broad-based growth across the network. So I'd probably think about it in 3 ways. There's we've got kind of established subsidiaries that are kind of more mature that are growing faster than market rates. So that's good news. Those are the kind of the candidate, the Ks, the Frances. We've got a couple of subs that are newer, like Germany and Mexico that seeing double-digit growth. So those are really strong contributors for us in middle markets. From a global markets group perspective is, we're seeing good broad-based growth across multiple regions. For 2024, I'd point to LatAm and probably Eastern Europe has been to kind of standouts. We've had great growth rates in India, Middle East, and we've had pockets growth country by country. But I think to answer your question around how we evaluate, is every country is a little bit different. And what route to market, how we partner, how we -- the competitive intensity market-by-market, that's all going to be a little different. The brands we can register, which ones we can. So we're quite thoughtful about where do we have the right to win from a port perspective what brands can open the door and create scale. And that will -- there's more commonality than not, but there's going to be one is market take, but that's the way we're approaching it.
Unidentified Analyst: So Rick, you talked about your 2025 guidance being mainly volume driven, and that's the history of the company over a long period of time. But if you were to see further commodity inflation from here partially maybe because of tariffs, would you consider price increases in the U.S. and your picture, how you're seeing the competitive environment in the U.S. from a promotional activity?
Rick Dierker: Price increases are not really anything that's being discussed right now, right? The consumer is exhausted. And so companies, including ours, we're working extremely hard to offset any inflation even though we had higher historical inflation this year and our expectation is, again, in 2025, we're offsetting the productivity. And that's the expectation right now. If there's some sort of hyperinflation or a hyper event, then time will tell on what has to happen. But if it's anywhere within normal bounds companies are going to offset that.
Unidentified Analyst: I'd like to switch a little bit on the great book that you've seen with some of your newer brands here on THERABREATH, or obviously internationally, but that we will get to a point where you're going to have to start tough start comping really tough compares and lapping that. So how are you thinking about that and space opportunity you still have ahead to ensure that we're not quite at that point where that becomes a big challenge? And then related, can you touch a little bit on kind of how you're allocating your marketing and innovation dollars. Got a little bit of a glimpse of that today, but not too much for the second half of 2025. So -- any color you can give us on where you're spending and then your flexibility in that spend if new trends come up or new global issues come up that could come and provide a little bit more volatility?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I think we have -- we still have a great growth profile for HERO and THERABREATH for years to come, okay? Yes, when you look at those explosive consumption numbers, that can't continue forever. But we believe we have double-digit grower for a long time. And why do we leave that? It goes back to household penetration. It goes back to brand awareness. I'll let Stacey talk about brand awareness. We just for HERO and THERABREATH. But it's underwhelming still. And so we have a lot of opportunity to invest behind those 2 businesses. You can either fix the weakness, and we're always problem-solving, that's our culture. We're going to go improve every brand we have. But to double down on the strength matters too. And HERO and THERABREATH are strengths, and we're going to get behind them in a big way.
Stacey Ramstedt: Yes. I think Rick just mentioned something really important and that is our unaided and aided awareness are still fairly low for both of these brands. So I could not be more confident that our jobs are just to get out there and drive awareness on both of those brands so that we can attract new users and drive velocity to the products that we have at shelf. And I'm also thinking about our acne portfolio. HERO is about treating the life cycle of the pimple. So that really gives us a lot of runway for additional innovation spaces that will certainly be tapping into as we move forward.
Rick Dierker: And in terms of marketing allocation, I would just -- we don't get into that level until I would just say that for innovation, we're putting chips behind, of course, Deep Clean, things that you saw up here, Deep Clean laundry detergent sheets, the BATISTE launch, like all of our innovation, the vitamin innovation, we're putting dollars and investment behind all of those.
Matt Farrell: The only thing I'd add to that is, so a lot of written about, hey, here THERABREATH or pulling the train so much for Church & Dwight. And it's a little bit like Olympics. You take out the highs and you take out the lows and then has the core doing. And you got to keep in mind, our vitamin business has been dropping, big business double-digit, and we're still growing over 4% on an annual basis. So you got to look at context when you're pulling things in and out.
Rick Dierker: All right. Matt, do you want to close this?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Any other questions? All right. So this is my final trip to the stock exchange. A few people have asked me about how is that going today. And my response is that it feels like it's happening in slow motion. So when you do this every year, it's sort of like, yes, something to do, and then you're thinking about the next quarter and the year and CAGNY and whatnot. But not for me. This is the last time for me. So I'm going to enjoy it today. So thank you all and many of you are become friends over the years. So many of you will see at CAGNY, we look forward to that. But then April fool's day, April 1 will be my last day with the company. And as I've said before, I think this management team that you see here the talent that we have in the company, our commitment to delivering not just for ourselves, but for the investors is very strong in the company. We've got a super strong bound lots of cash at this come to acquire businesses. This is a great company to bet on. So meeting is adjourned. Thank you.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Hi. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q3 results, then I'll turn the mic over to Rick Dierker, our CFO and Head of Business Operations. And once Rick is done, we'll open the call up for some Q&A. All right, Q3 was another solid quarter for Church & Dwight. Reported sales growth was 3.8%, which beat our outlook of 2.5%. And that was thanks to strong results from our domestic, international and specialty products businesses. Organic sales grew 4.3%, which exceeded our 3% Q3, outlook, with volume accounting for a very healthy 3.1% of our growth. Adjusted gross margin expanded 60 basis points. At the same time, we increased marketing spending, and we gained market share in the majority of our categories. Adjusted EPS was $0.79, which was $0.12 higher than our $0.67 outlook. So nice beat, the quality results were driven by higher than expected sales growth, and gross margin expansion. Our online class of trade continues to perform well, with online sales as a percentage of global sales at approximately 21%. Next, I'm going to comment on each of the three businesses. And the first up will be the U.S. business, with 3.3% organic sales growth. Volume growth was 2.6%, and this is the fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth in our U.S. business, with five of our seven power brands gaining market share in the quarter. Now let's look at a few important categories in the U.S., innovation of course is a big contributor to our success this year, and every year. As I comment on the categories, I'll highlight the success of the new product launches. I'm going to start off with Laundry Detergent ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent consumption grew 2%, which outpaced a flat category with ARM & HAMMER share in the quarter reaching 14.7%. The unit dose category declined 1.1%. However, ARM & HAMMER unit dose saw a consumption growth of 16.5%, and we grew a share of 70 bps, to 4.8% a unit dose. Regarding new products, this year we launched two new products into the detergent category, ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean and ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets. Deep Clean is our most proud premium laundry detergent, where we entered the mid-tier of liquid laundry. Deep Clean accounted for a little over 40% of ARM & HAMMER's liquid laundry detergent consumption growth in the quarter, and it's highly incremental to our franchise. The second new product is Power Sheets. This is a new form of laundry detergent, and you may remember in August of 2023, ARM & HAMMER was first major brand to offer this new unit dose form in the U.S. Our fresh linen scented sheet, is now the number two sheet on Amazon, and since launching this product into bricks and mortar this year, we have seen high consumer interest in the form. ARM & HAMMER is the number one sheet brand at Kroger. It's also the number two brand in whole food [ph]. We feel great about the future prospects for this new form. Now I'm going to switch over to litter. The category was flat in Q3. That's category consumption. As expected, ARM & HAMMER litter consumption declined 1.5% and this reflects the absence of a competitor out of stock situation, which benefited our prior year market share. The good news is we've held onto about half of our prior year share gains. Our new lightweight ARM & HAMMER Clumping Litter, which is our new product this year, is outperforming our expectations as our share of the lightweight category continues to grow. This is important, because lightweight accounts for 17% of the clumping litter category. Hardball, became the number two major brand in Lightweight segment in Q3. Now I'm going to switch over to personal care. The gummy vitamins business continues to be a drag on the company's organic growth. The gummy vitamin category declined 0.3%. We can call that flat in Q3, which is an improvement from the category declines in the past few quarters. The bad news is our consumption was down even greater. We were down 10%. The improvement of this business is taking far longer than we expected, and as you saw in the release has reduced our expectations about the long-term growth, and profit of the business. This resulted in a $357 million write-down of the book value of the assets. We continue to move forward with our stabilization actions, which include new packaging, upgraded formulas to improve the consumer experience, and higher marketing investments, which gives us some degree of optimism for the business is the innovation that we have coming in 2025. Next up is BATISTE, which continues to see strong growth with consumption up 6% in Q3, growing share to 46% BAPTISTE continues to be the global leader in dry shampoo. This year, we launched BATISTE Sweat Activated and BATISTE Touch Activated. These innovations continue to bring new users to the category, which is very important and already these two new products account for, or 2% of the dry shampoo category, and Sweat Activated is the number one new product on dry shampoo. Over in mouthwash, THERABREATH continues to perform extremely well. The mouthwash category was up 5% in Q3, but here's a few stats. Alcohol-based mouthwash was down 1%, while non-alcohol category grew 11%. THERABREATH is the number one alcohol free mouthwash with 35% share, and is the number three brand in total mouthwash with an 18% share. Again, over to new products, this year we entered the Antiseptic segment of the category with the launch of THERABREATH Deep Clean Oral Rinse. It's important to note that the antiseptic subcategory represents about 30% of the $2 billion mouthwash category, and our launch into antiseptics has accounted for 100 basis points, of our 400 basis points year-over-year growth in market share. So great indicator of the future, for the antiseptic ones. HERO is the number one brand in acne care, with a 22% share and continues to drive the majority of the growth in the category. The patch category grew 42% while HERO grew patch market share by 1.7 basis points to 57% shares. So HERO continues to launch innovative solutions, and patches and we're very bullish about the future of that brand. I'm going to provide you with a couple of remarks on promotional levels in our household categories. In the liquid laundry detergent, we've seen stable sold on promotion in the low 30s over the last few quarters. Over in unit dose pretty much the same story. Percentage sold on promotion, is also stable averaging in the low 30s over the last few quarters. Litter is a different story. In litter conditions are different and promotional levels have increased, and here's the trend line. So if you look at Q1, sold-on deal was 15.5%. Q2 was a little over 18%. In Q3, it was 19.5%, but it's going to be even higher in Q4. The increase in litter promotions is primarily driven by one major competitor, where sold-on deal exceeds 40%. All right, turning now to International and Specialty Products, our international business delivered organic growth of 8.1% in Q3. That's right on our algorithm of 8%. This was driven by strong growth in every one of our subsidiaries, as well as our global markets group. Finally, Specialty Products organic sales increased 7.5%. That's three quarters now of solid organic growth for this business. We're confident that this division will achieve 5% organic sales growth this year, and will hit our evergreen growth targets. So feel great about our progress in Specialty Products. This commentary on the consumer. In July, we noted a deceleration in consumption in our categories. This continued in Q3 as we expected, after seeing 4.5% growth in our categories for the first five months of the year, June, July and August were closer to 2.5%. Now in September, we saw consumption in our categories strengthen to about 3%. And then in October category consumption was up 5%. But let's all remind ourselves that the hurricane and the port strike, no doubt influenced those results. So we remain cautious in Q4, regarding the U.S. consumer and category growth rates. I want to wrap up my comments, by reiterating that the company is performing well with all three divisions, delivering strong growth. I want to thank all the Church & Dwighters out there, for doing such a great job each and every day. Great team. And now, I'm going to turn it over to Rick to provide more color on the quarter, and full year outlook.
Rick Dierker: All right, thank you Matt, and good morning everybody. We'll start with EPS, on a reported basis we had a loss of $0.31 a share primarily, due to non-cash asset impairment of our vitamin business. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.79, up almost 7% from the prior year. The $0.79 was better than our $0.67 outlook and is a high quality beat primarily driven, by higher than expected operating profit. Reported revenue was up 3.8% and organic sales were up 4.3%. Organic sales were driven, by volume of 3.1% and positive price mix of 1.2%. Volume was again the primary driver of organic growth, and we expect volume growth to continue in Q4. Our third quarter adjusted gross margin was 45%, a 60 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to productivity volume mix, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs. Let me walk you through the Q3 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive 140 basis points impact from volume and mix, a positive 130 basis point impact from productivity and a 10 basis points positive impact related to acquisitions. This was partially offset by 220 basis points from higher manufacturing costs. Moving to marketing, marketing was up $18 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 12.3% or 80 basis points higher than Q3 of last year, and helped drive share gains. For Q3 SG&A, adjusted SG&A increased 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to international R&D and IT investments. Other expense decreased by $11.9 million. We now expect other expense, for the full year to be approximately $65 million on adjusted basis. In Q3, there was a tax benefit of 25.9%, and this was related to the vitamin impairment. Excluding that impact, our effective rate was 23.8% and that compares to 24.1% in Q3 of 2023. The expected adjusted effective tax rate for the full year, is now approximately 22.5% versus the previous outlook of 23%. And now to cash. For the first nine months of 2024, cash from operating activities was $864 million, an increase of almost $70 million driven by higher cash earnings. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $1.1 billion. We're having a great year in regards to cash. CapEx for the first nine months was $125 million, almost a $4 million increase from the prior year. As capacity expansion projects proceeded as planned. We expect 2024 CapEx of approximately $180 million, as we complete the majority of those investments that were initiated in 2023. And we continue to expect CapEx, to return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025, and beyond. And now for the full year outlook. As Matt mentioned, while we saw U.S. consumption in our categories improve slightly towards the end of the third quarter, we remain cautious regarding the U.S. consumer and category growth rates, for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect our organic revenue outlook, to be approximately 4% and reported sales growth, to be approximately 3.5%. We continue to expect full year, adjusted EPS to be approximately 8%. Turning to gross margin, we now expect expansion of approximately 110 basis points, at the high end of the previous range and we now expect marketing as percent of sales, to be above 11%. And as you read in the release, to the extent our business does better than our outlook. We plan on incrementally investing behind marketing and SG&A, to help enter 2025 with momentum. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chris Carey: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Hi, how are you? I'm going to start with the outlook for Q4. I want to understand, if there are any inventory timing dynamics, which are going into Q3 or Q4, or if this outlook is primarily reflecting, I guess, a view that consumption trends should start to decelerate through the quarter, as you lap some of these atypical benefits that maybe you've seen of late. And so, we should be expecting that, and perhaps just some lingering conservatism about not trying to call, any improvement in category growth rates versus, say again some sort of inventory, or shipment timing dynamic.
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll take the first one, part of it on inventory, and Matt will talk about the category consumption growth rates. We hear small things on retail inventory, but not anything that we would call out, and not enough to impact anything. There's small examples, but not enough to influence what we would be calling.
Matt Farrell: Yes, and Chris, as far as the categories grow, if you just, you kind of look at Q1, Q2 and Q3, for some of our major categories. So if you look at liquid laundry detergent Q1, Q2, Q3, the category was up 3% up 1% flat. You look at litter up 5%, up 2% flat, and then go to mouthwash up 13%, up 9% and then 5%. Patches are pretty steady high double-digits. But the acne category is 14%, 8%, 7%. But obviously HERO being patches. So, we're somewhat unaffected by that. But if you just look at the trend, you can see a deceleration. So that's one of the reasons why we'll say, hi we're still cautious about the economy, that's the categories. We tend to be doing better, because we're taking share, but that's always the only lever you have when things are starting to slowdown. So yes, we feel good about our performance. We called 3% in Q3. We put up to 4%. We had some good performance in our brand, some share take, but kind of like where we are going into Q4.
Chris Carey: Okay. That makes sense. Then one quick follow-up would be, there's an expectation over time for the U.S. business to be delivering 4% top line growth. Clearly you're still trying to figure out, what the appropriate level is in the current environment relative to where the categories are going. But how much visibility do you think you have in that top line growth objective in the U.S., from here it's not really a 2025 guidance question per se. But just the ability to deliver against an objective, which came up by about a point relative to past in the current environment. And if not, how long you think you'd need to get there again? So thanks so much.
Rick Dierker: Yes, that was sort of a veiled attempt at 2025 guidance.
Chris Carey: You take that how you will? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: I want to correct you on one thing. As far as our algorithm goes, when we moved from 3% to 4% top line, the U.S. portion of that was going from 2% to 3%. So - and obviously that's the big dog. It's the lion share of our business. So the expectation is that we're going to grow at 3% going forward. So 3% for the domestic business, 8% for international, 5% for SBD. That's how we get to our 4%.
Chris Carey: Yes, sorry if I didn't come across. That was really embedded in the question? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And look, we got to look at our portfolio and say when you have a long-term algorithm, it's not just '25, it's '25, '26, '27. And so, we look at the strength of our brands, we look at the innovation we have planned over a three year basis. '25, '26, '27. And consequently, we encourage that. If you look back, our history is we hit our algorithm just about every year. In fact yourself, over the last 10 years we've hit 4%. That one is one. It was one of the reasons why we said, hi, why don't we just make that our algorithm going forward?
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I think just to add to that, why do we take share over time? Well one of the reasons, is we have great innovation and we're putting support behind innovation, to go drive trial to grow households. And that's kind of also where we're reinvesting, as we over deliver in 2024. So that's why, we think we're going to enter 2025 with momentum.
Matt Farrell: Yes. So when you have contracting categories, the way home is always going to be innovation and share gain.
Chris Carey: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So just going back to the vitamin business. So an impairment this quarter. How are you thinking about the path to stabilization and then growth? Do you think in '25, we may start to see stabilization in that business, and just any green shoots maybe you're seeing with the efforts there?
Matt Farrell: Yes. What would be - we've been at this now for probably more than a year and a half, and the things such as graphics and packaging and messaging, those things that we can control are in place. As far as innovation goes, that has not hit the market. We really haven't had any meaningful innovation for a few years now. And that's what, as I said in my earlier remarks, that's what gives us some optimism about stabilizing this business in 2025.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And maybe some other green shoots. As Matt said, we have probably 10 different things that are happening. The core of it is we got to get the consumer being delighted in our product again, right. And making sure that we're doing all of our reformulations so that consumers are picking our product, and our brand that they know and they love for a long period of time. But some green shoots, I would say we've seen some lifts, and some retailers where a few of these things are kind of ahead of the curve. And so that's been encouraging. We did, one of the 10 levers was looking at price gaps, and we adjusted a price gap in a couple areas and units are up dramatically. So there's good progress. Like Matt said, innovation really is coming in March, April of next year. So we got to give that a shot, and we're optimistic.
Matt Farrell: Yes, if you're looking for green shoots, the one, this is a smaller part of the business, but L'IL CRITTERS has been really responsive so far. In fact, L'IL CRITTERS gained some share in the past quarter. So that's a good thing. But really the lion share of the business, is adult and that's where we need the innovation.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your marking investments. You called out expected stepped up spend in Q4, and you raised your guidance a bit this year to more than 11% as a percentage of sales. So could you give us more color behind the greater investments in terms of types of spend, any changes with strategy, either channel, medium, et cetera. And then I would be curious to hear if more of the dollars will be shifted internationally. And then, if I may, finally just on a go forward basis, should we assume you're going to continue to step up this spend as a percentage of sales in the next several years, to support your 4% organic sales growth expectations, as you've called out in your evergreen model? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Hi, Bonnie, that's a good detailed question. I'll start and I'm sure Matt wants to add a couple thoughts. But when you look at our raise of marketing spend going to 11% to somewhere between probably 11% and 11.5% that's meaningful. That's $20 plus million in some cases, and some of that is international across markets, because we're driving different brands and they're doing really well too. But THERABREATH expansion, HERO expansion, STERIMAR BATISTE internationally, but in the U.S. we have a lot of places where we're spending, but most of that spends behind our innovation. Again, this is one of our best years of innovation. We believe that's why we're getting share in many cases. That's why we're doing so well and over delivering even our top line expectations. And so, a lot of the marketing spend goes behind things like Deep Clean on laundry, things like sheets on laundry, things like Hardball on Litter and our new BATISTE and I'll touch and move.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And the other thing I would add to that is 85% of our advertising is digital right now. So we have a great ability to move around, and take advantage of different vehicles at different times of the year. So I wouldn't say any more than that and go brand-by-brand. But Rick's right. Internationally is part of where the spend is in the fourth quarter, as is domestic, even a little bit in specialty products.
Rick Dierker: And as far as our future looking marketing as percentage, our algorithms around 11%. It all depends on how our share, share is the scorecard. So our shares are doing fantastically well. You heard in the release 5% of 7%, I think year-to-date we're 10% of 14% for all of our brands, all of our old power brands. So that scorecard is what really matters. And as long as we're gaining share, and more often than not, I think that's the right level. And if we feel like it's not, then we'll adjust.
Bonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. I did ask multiple questions in one, so I'll pass it along. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Thanks very much. Actually to follow-up on that. Sorry, I might have missed it in your answer, but the marketing spend in the third quarter came in a little bit lower than least external expectations, you know, obviously made up for in the fourth quarter. But does any. Was there anything, from your perspective that shifted that marketing support from 3Q to 4Q, or was it just more of anomaly versus how we all on the outside modeled it?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I think it is more of an anomaly. I mean, we're getting very specific, but we were up 80 basis points in Q3, which is a significant increase. We had told everybody that we were going to be down a few hundred in Q4, because we were spreading that spend that was maybe a little higher in Q4 of last year over to Q1, Q2 and Q3, to better support innovation. And I wouldn't even call it timing. It was probably just a, disconnect between the outside models, and what we were going to do.
Steve Powers: Okay. Cool. And I guess more of an overarching question, you've kind of touched upon some of this, some of what I think is going to be in your answer, but the perception among many investors of late is that Church & Dwight's in a relatively fragile position here navigating this second half and heading into next year. Just given that so much growth has been driven by THERABREATH and HERO, whereas investors view the core legacy business as being a bit more choppy, probably with added focus there on categories like vitamins and litter of late. But just how do you respond to that, either with respect to reasons to believe in the resilience of THERABREATH and HERO, or conversely, reasons for more holistic confidence in that legacy core business?
Matt Farrell: Yes, hey, I'll take a swing at that. Rick can kind of pile on. Look, we manage a portfolio and we're in lots of different categories. And yes, it's true that THERABREATH and HERO have delivering outsized performance over the past year, but this ebbs and flows over the years. If you look back over many years there's different times where different businesses pull the train. So I think the new products that we have in those, some of the categories that you may be referring to, like laundry and litter are going to be a big part of our growth in the future. That will be sheets and that would be hardball. And also the innovation and other categories outside of patches as well, but if you look long-term, the THERABREATH is not done. When we bought this business, we said, hey, this can be a $0.5 billion business over time. So whereas we'd say, yes, the distribution for that business has probably been achieved as far as number of doors we haven't done is spread out on shelf with other variants. So I think there's still significant growth ahead of us for THERABREATH. And as far as HERO goes, we don't want to get distracted by moving into other categories. We want to make sure we nailed and grew patches and created more awareness around that and more household penetration. But the HERO brand has the opportunity to spread into adjacent categories going forward. So I think the investors should be confident that those two brands will continue to grow in the future. And because of the innovation we have in laundry and litter, dry shampoo, et cetera, we have differentiated products that will drive growth in the future as well.
Rick Dierker: Yes, and I would just echo a few of those comments. I think THERABREATH and HERO have years of runway, TDPs in some cases, but just household penetration like mouthwash is an example of 65% household penetration and THERABREATH is around nine. It's now the number two mouthwash. So there's lots of runway for those two. But really the crux of your question is, well, what about your base business? And so I would say a lot of optimism on how to have base business. Litter, for example, it's kind of messy right now as you look at year-over-year comps because some competitor was out of stock for such a long period of time. But if you look back before the outage that they had at our share and at our share today, we've maintained about 40% of those share gains. And so I don't really look at the week-over-week or month-over-month. Numbers are kind of meaningless right now. But if we look at baselines, that's what I look at. And so I feel like litter is strong and getting stronger. Innovation, as Matt said Laundry. Laundry, we're still at all time high shares. We feel like over a long period of time we have the same stair step up that we've experienced before. We're entering the mid-tier with Deep Clean. It's doing well. It's driving incremental category growth for retailers. Unit dose is hitting all time share highs and we're going into sheets and sheets is a category that's growing 30%. So a lot of optimism.
Steve Powers: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning, guys. So first, just to follow up on category growth. Matt, you didn't sound particularly excited about the pickup in category growth in September, October. Is that just because you think a lot of it was driven by hurricane volume and as you parse the underlying data, you didn't necessarily see as much of a pickup? Is it just a short enough period of time that you're not much more enthusiastic around category growth? And I know you touched on it a bit, but just trying to get a sense as we look beyond Q4, if we're in this more muted category growth environment given a lack of pricing or if you think you're starting to see some green shoots from a category perspective? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, I guess I must have curbed my enthusiasm. So I would say this, Dara, that if you look at the first couple of weeks of October, you saw like double digit consumption growth in some categories. We said, well, that's not sustainable. And it was so different from what we saw in any week in September or since then. We would say the hurricane and the port strike no doubt influenced the results. So consequently, if there's some pantry loading that went on in the first couple weeks, that's just pulling forward from somewhere else in Q4. So we would say, hey, I'm going to kind of look at that as October is maybe an anomaly and maybe the quarter is more like September where we inflected from June, July, August, our categories up 2.5% versus 3% in September. But it's not -- our remarks are not necessarily a broad category, broad commentary on the U.S. economy. We're commenting on our categories. So we look at the -- our categories. That is what we're commenting on. I think, 3% to me is pretty healthy.
Rick Dierker: Yes. If you look back at history, if we were growing 4% as a company, many times the categories would be growing, 2% or 3% would be taking share and that's how we got to the 4%. So I'd say, it's kind of in line with history.
Dara Mohsenian: Great, that's helpful. And then on HERO and THERABREATH, can you give us an update on how much of the business is international today for each of those brands and how much incrementality you see looking out to 2025 in terms of expansion potential?
Rick Dierker: Yes. What I can tell you without quoting numbers for sales is that we've been running really hard to get THERABREATH and HERO registered in other countries. And our goal was to have HERO registered in 40 countries by the end of 2024. And we're there. So we feel good about that. And the impediment, of course, is regulatory bodies and they vary from country-to-country. But we're pleasantly surprised that both brands do travel well, even THERABREATH. Now, THERABREATH is the highest priced mouthwash market today in the U.S. Naturally, when you go to international markets, there's a raised eyebrow about how you be successful with such an expensive mouthwash. But yet it has been. So we'll keep that in mind for maybe end of January when we talk to you guys who have an Analyst Day. And then we'll frame out a little bit better HERO and THERABREATH percentage, U.S. versus international, how many countries we're registered in and what expectations are.
Dara Mohsenian: Great, thanks. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Peter Grom with UPS. Your line is now open.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on Dara's question there. I mean, maybe just to be clear, can you just help us understand what you are assuming for category growth in 4Q? Matt, I think you just said you're kind of assuming the September trends for the quarter rather than the stronger October or the weaker July and August. So just -- I just wanted to clarify that. And then I guess if that is the case, if you are assuming slightly stronger category growth this quarter, and I apologize if I did miss this, but can you maybe help us understand what's driving the sequential slowdown in the 4Q organic sales? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Well, look, let's go to your first question with respect to categories. It was 4.5 for first five months of the year. The next three months were 2.5. And then we'd say, hey, September was 3 and October was a really big number. We'd say Q4 on average would be 2.5. And we'll say, it will take -- will say, hey, the month of October is an anomaly and that November, December will be a lot like June, July and August. And that's no different than what we thought in July. So consequently, yes, we had a really good third quarter, but we beat our number organically. But we're saying, yes, for second half, we still feel good about 3% in total for the second half. And that's why we said 2 to 3 is fine as a call for Q4.
Peter Grom: Got it. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Anna Lizzul: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I wanted to touch on gross margin which outperformed this quarter. The guidance for the full year seems a bit conservative. So I was just wondering if you could talk about your outlook on commodity costs and manufacturing. I think you noted in Q3 that manufacturing costs were a bit higher. Is that also expected to impact Q4? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes, hey Anna, it's Rick. I think from a gross margin perspective, you're right. We're bit more conservative. If you say the full year is at 110, it means Q4 is up slightly. I would just remind everyone that Q4 a year ago was our high water mark at 44 6. That's part of it. Some of the commodities were flat in the first half, like ethylene. They're up in the back half around 9%, same for liner board. We have investments in our warehouse that we talked about at Analyst Day in our network and that built throughout the year. So yes, could that be a little conservative maybe? I think also we have -- as we look forward, we still are seeing inflation like that is -- that's what we're seeing. And our job is to offset that with productivity. So that's what we're focused on. And then the other thing on gross margin is, as we make investments to support these new products like in trade or couponing, that also impacts gross margin. So that's kind of an eclectic and wide ranging view. But those are the details.
Anna Lizzul: All right, thank you, that's helpful. And just as a follow up on the category discussion here, are you seeing any difference in customer purchasing habits between retail channels or on quantities here? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: No, I would say remember we've been growing volume for five quarters in a row and we continue to see -- most of the categories are volume driven growth. Our categories and purchasing patterns are the same.
Anna Lizzul: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about promotional environment and laundry in particular. In last year's fourth quarter you talked about pulling some of the unprofitable promotional activity and scanner sales were down. So just want to think about 4Q. Is it kind of like an easy comp as you get into fourth quarter or is it like the right base now and last year was the adjustment period? And anything else you'd add on kind of promo environment in laundry. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, I'd say you're right about that, Lauren. We did eliminate some what we thought were just not profitable or uneconomical investments. What's different this year is we have such a great year in new products, particular in household with litter, with hardball and deep cleaning and large detergent. That will be one of the places we'll be investing in Q4 in trade promotion. One of the things that Rick called out in his response to gross margin.
Lauren Lieberman: Yes, okay.
Matt Farrell: Yes.
Lauren Lieberman: One thing I noticed also, I know Deep Clean has been really successful and I may be me being too picky, but it was interesting to me that in some of the Q&A thus far, when you've been talking about laundry innovation you're putting, it seems like a bit more emphasis on sheets versus Deep Clean. Can you just maybe talk about the direction of travel you see for category development? How significant do you think sheets can be? Because Proctor, of course, has been doing a trial of this and as they go, probably really helps to amplify awareness in the category of this form. So just curious your thoughts on the relevance of sheets as a new form, and then the profitability of that versus the traditional liquid business, even the higher price point Deep Clean?
Matt Farrell: Yes, you're right. It is a good question. And it's true. We're very excited about sheets. But let me go back to Deep Clean. So the whole idea around Deep Clean was to have a good, better, best strategy. So the good is the orange bottle, it's the base ARM & HAMMER. The better is ARM & HAMMER with OXICLEAN. And the best is Deep Clean. And Deep Clean in mid-tier, it's our highest priced laundry detergent. Just to give you some sense, it's got 90% premium to the yellow box. Not the yellow box, but yellow bottle. And it's like a 40% premium for the ARM & HAMMER with OXICLEAN. But we're still at 15 plus percent discount to premium. And if you look at the trends, it's mid-tier that's been growing. So we feel good about the timing of our launch. It's important that that sticks so we have good, better, best going forward long term. And we think that Deep Clean can be a source of growth for us in the future. And that's, I would say if you go back to Steve Powers question about why you feel good going forward about your big businesses like laundry and litter laundry in particular, it's reasons like that. And then sheets. Sheets is a brand new form and it's efficacious. There's no plastic. Could it cannibalize some of your existing businesses? That's true. But we're the first major brand to launch in this form. It's good to be first. So we think that'll be a bigger emphasis for us going forward. Unit dose today is like 22%, 23% of the category. We have not had a big share in unit dose historically, which have been bouncing around between 4% and 5% of that very big subcategory. So sheets then, in addition to our existing pots, is the way home for us to grow and unit dose. So I appreciate the question because this all fits together and that's why we think we're in a good position going forward in the detergent.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Okay. Thanks so much for all that. I really appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question on litter and the promotional environment there and how you potentially intend to respond. Matt, as you mentioned, Clorox has stepped up promotion levels to remarkably high levels. Most of the regained share that they're seeing with Fresh Step is coming at the expense of ARM & HAMMER. So a couple questions. Have you been surprised by the magnitude of the spend here on trade support from Clorox? It's taken dollars out of the category. It doesn't do anything to impact consumption. Seems like you're trying to get the share back in sort of one quick swing. And then how do you intend to respond? It kind of feels like it has year markings of a potential price war like we saw in laundry, like over a decade ago. But Rick, if I'm interpreting your tone correctly, it seems like you're generally okay relinquishing the share gains over the past year. So your thoughts there would be appreciated? And then I have an unrelated follow up. Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll give you a couple comments and then Matt will chime in I'm sure. My comments, we're really happy with where we are at litter. This year-over-year as Clorox comes back in stock is what it is. Our baseline volumes are higher than they were. Our shares are higher than they were. We are really happy with 40% or so share gain, if you look back when this whole stuff started. We're not going to go chase share on a race to the bottom to go promote. If we promote, it's going to be behind our innovation to go drive a fair share in lightweight litter because we think that's where the opportunity is. So that's what we're doing. I'm optimistic that we're going to retain share because that over time it's difficult for cats to switch litters. It just is. After they've been out for a while and they have one product, that's what they get used to. So that's also why maybe the effectiveness of some of the competitor promotions aren't as high as they used to be because it's hard to switch litters or harder. So anyway, that's some context. Matt, anything like add?
Matt Farrell: No. When you see numbers like 40% to 45% sold on deal. So we're not going to chase that, Kevin. To the extent we promote, it's going to be behind hardball, which is our new product. And yes, obviously, when you're hit with a cyber event, obviously the expectation was that of course competitors are going to spend back to try to win back consumers, but we're going to be on the sidelines as far as spend a lot of money to chase that number.
Kevin Grundy: Okay. Quick follow up and then I'll pass it on. Just on portfolio pruning. So, Rick, I think you've expressed an openness here which has generally not been part of the company strategy for a very long time. We naturally have the CEO transition which is going to be occurring in March. You need to bring a CFO on board. If you could just give us an update on potential parameters, scope, timing of what seems like it will be a potentially newer sort of leg to the stool, if you will, of the company strategy. And then I'll pass it on? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes, I mean as a backdrop, we got to remember a lot of stuff that we do we're going to keep doing. The company is performing extremely well. The strategy is sound. We're leaders in ecom growth. As an example, M&A is best-in-class. We can identify, acquire, integrate and grow acquisitions. We do a few things uniquely in the company. Every year, we go value every brand that we have. And we know what brands or businesses are creating value, or destroying value. And we take that back and we usually have internal teams that, go turn that around or address root causes. And to the extent that we don't, then that's when things more strategic conversations are had. Now I'm not going to front run any of that. I'd say maybe in early to mid-next year, we'll talk more about that. But it's really, we've been doing it for a long time. It's what we do internally, and we got to hold kind of mirror up to all of our brands, just like we do when we do acquisitions. But remember, we have a great portfolio of brands. We have a high performing company. We're gaining share in most of our businesses. So, we're coming from a position of strength.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Hi Kevin, I want to remind everybody too. If I think back to when I got the job in January of '16, within a couple years I had a new Head of Marketing, supply chain, R&D, sales. Three of those four came from the outside. So we've been here before. We just got such a rock solid core of the company. This is a lot of talent here. There's no way we could get the numbers that we get, year-after-year we have a lot of talent up and down the line. So yes, I think we're all excited about a couple searches, and get some new people in the company, new ideas, new energy. So I think, we're in a real good place.
Kevin Grundy: Okay. Very good. I appreciate it. Thank you both.
Matt Farrell: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So on the gross margin side, how should we be thinking about the puts and takes ahead of commodities, and the timing of certain contracts influence your view, especially in fiscal 2025, and a follow-up on the M&A? I think that's the only question we haven't answered, we haven't asked yet. In terms of like how you're seeing the landscape. I know you're very purposeful and cautious about what your targets are, but just as a, follow-up and an update on how you're thinking about inorganic growth? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll take the gross margin question. I would say I kind of commented already on we do see inflation as we look forward, we see inflation, our job to offset that through productivity. As you take a big step back though, the different macroeconomic indications like China demand and really the U.S. economy, stable but not outsized growth. We have taken a position of not hedging as much as we usually do, believing that some of those commodities will come down over time. So I would tell you that's probably a good indication of our expectations as we go forward.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Andrea, could you clarify your other question about M&A?
Andrea Teixeira: Yes. No, Matt. I was just like thinking more how it's been -- I know it's part of your algorithm long term, not necessarily, of course, [ what you give in ] the evergreen model does not include that. But indirectly does, because you - as you create - as you buy these brands and companies, you create future growth, and is part of your long-term algorithm. So I was thinking like more it's been a while since you - and you're accumulating cash since you've done acquisitions. Of course, the last year were very good, very accretive. So just thinking of how we should be approaching that? Or we should be thinking you're focusing more inorganic at this point?
Matt Farrell: Well, look, we're always on the hunt. We generate so much cash. Of course, our criteria is pretty strict. So we do -- pretty fussy about the things that we'll buy. It is true that you can buy a couple of businesses that could be fast growing for a couple of years, but then they have to grow 3% to 4% or faster, depending on which categories are going forward. So I would say, no, we're not saying that we're focusing solely on the existing portfolio. But I'll remind everybody, if you go back in time, we've had periods where we've had droughts before, where we didn't buy a business. I think the longest one was probably between '08 and '11. When '08, we bought Orajel, and the next one was BATISTE in 2011. But so if you look at that through a three-year period, we had three great years. So it's - we're not - our algorithm isn't dependent upon going for an acquisition.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And the reason we - as you look back, the reason we are more successful than most to identify and acquire, integrate and grow acquisitions, because we're really fussy. And so that's part of the model, and that's what we're going to continue to be. We want to make sure, we do the right deal when we do the deal.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.
Filippo Falorni: Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask you about innovation, and maybe you can give us some context of the contribution from innovation this year in laundry, and the rest of your business? And just any plans for 2025, and like areas of potential further innovation. And then a quick follow-up. So on the gross margin, as we think about elections and potential for tariffs, last time, there was some implication on the WATERPIK business from some portion that were reported from China. Maybe can you remind us any potential exposure on China tariffs? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question. On innovation, we're actually super excited about innovation. It's close to around 2% incremental net sales for us in 2024. So remember, we have a high bar. We don't call gross sales. We don't call gross new product contribution, that's incremental net sales. So about half of our growth is kind of coming from innovation, which is fantastic. That's been accelerated. It used to be 1%, 1.5%. And so we've built that muscle. We have a lot of different inputs. Carlos, our leader in R&D; Leslie, our leader in NPP, all across the commercial team we are doing really well on innovation. I expect that to continue. I think as we look forward, we have great pipelines over the next two or three years. We're not really even talking about 2025 right now. We're talking about 2026 and even early conversations on '27. So that muscle's alive and well, and we're going to keep investing behind it and driving investment behind it. On China, right, just like everybody, we're well aware of implications there. I would say two things. One is we did reclass a lot of our SIC codes, import codes. And so that has helped and as you draw a circle around what may or may not be impacted. The second thing is we have moved some production outside of China. And so it's most material for the WATERPIK business, but there are plans in place and actions that we've taken to mitigate that impact.
Filippo Falorni: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Bill Chappell: Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Going back to vitamins. So I guess I'm having a tough time at work. Help me understand two things. One, just from a business standpoint, I mean, are you now thinking you need to spend more money behind it in '25? Or is it because with you being down 10% and the category being down basically flat, I'm not sure I understand the green shoots. It seems like things are getting worse. And so you can either step, up and put a lot of money behind it or you can kind of ease back and manage it more and more for cash. So are we at that point in a decision standpoint? And then second, kind of related. I also don't fully understand maybe the impairment charge 10 years after acquiring the business. So maybe you can help me understand why that was there and the timing and what that says, if anything? Thanks so much.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Sure, Bill. I would say, let me take the - I guess, the second one first, is when we do an impairment charge, all that is, is just looking forward of our model on what our growth rates growth rate assumption, is and that has -- what the category is growing at and what our expectations are as well as our margin expectations, and they've come down since we originally put all those assets on the book. And so it's kind of a reconciling of that, right? The original expectations to what our current number is, after we have amortization or - and we have value that versus the intangible numbers, and we say, oh, we have a gap and future growth and profits aren't as strong as they used to be. And so that's how you take a charge 10 years after. Your first question was on - why do we think - will we be putting more money behind it? We're not going to go chase incremental spending on promotions, and trade and advertising. That was a few of the levers that we pulled this year. And you're right, some of that is not working as we had hoped. Some of the things are working, and they do have green shoots the biggest, most important single thing that we can do is make sure that our core products are delaying the consumer. And that's why we're so focused on the innovation piece. We think -- this is the first time in a few years that we've put the full strength of the company on reformulating vitamins so that they -- we have our taste advantage back. We're hitting key marks in the market on sugar free, on plusing up our vitamins. So all those things are, I think, putting us in a better position to compete, and they're way more important than spending more on trade or getting displays or do another packaging spend.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that is when you buy a business, the excess that we purchased pre-over-tangible assets is largely going to be goodwill. So that's always going to be a big part of any write-off, and it's all dependent upon the DCF model. And as far as green shoots, though, that was not in our commentary. I think somebody offered up that we're asking about green shoots, we would say that we've done the things we can control. We have seen some benefit and some growth in L'IL CRITTERS. It's not the lion's share of the business. And as we - this business really struggled through and post COVID, and realized by the retailers. And in the meantime, we've been just working on improving our supply chain, which is now we have in a good place and in doing the work on new products. So innovation is ahead of us. And we thought 2024 was going to be an inflection point, it was not. That was dependent upon all the things we have talked about, meaning packaging and graphics and positioning and messaging advertising. But in the end, it's going to be the innovation Bill, and as Rick went through the - some of the things, we're changing that's ahead of us in 2025. So this time next year, we hope we have a different conversation with you.
Bill Chappell: Got it. Which leads me to just on next year, we won't be having a conversation. So congratulations on the - I know we'll have you for a few more months, Matt, on the retirement and Rick on the promotion? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Bill, I hope you make it to New York in January.
Bill Chappell: I wouldn't miss it.
Matt Farrell: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Olivia Tong: Great, thanks so much and congrats on retirement and promotion to you guys as well. My question is primarily around some of the more recent premium price innovation that you benefited from, particularly in laundry, with Deep Clean and the POWER SHEET segment and litter as well. So as we go into a potentially more - or we are in a more challenging backdrop, does your trade-up opportunity become more challenging relative to your peers, when macros get more challenging since your consumers, obviously skew a little bit more towards value to you, therefore, I would imagine that they are a bit more pressured relative to consumer average. So just wondering about your ability there. And then the mix implications, given that you obviously have been able to continue, to eke out a bit of mix benefit in the domestic business, despite obviously all the pricing lapping? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay. We got a lot in there. I think if I want to boil it down and you're wondering, because of our premium offerings of late, would that disadvantage us. And I would say, if you just take them one at a time for -- as Hardball goes, Hardball has been contributing to our share growth quarter-after-quarter. And we - last year, our share was like 4.5% of the category, the lightweight category. And that's grown quite a bit. We'll update everybody in January about what our share gain was on the entire year, but we think that's going to continue to grow. It's because of the performance of the product, which is it seizes up, close to, as hard as a rock. There's nothing in the category like it. POWER SHEETS it's laundry in a box. And I think given over time, maybe it's been a slower roll as far as the consumer willing to pay for sustainable products. But this one seems to be a winner for us. So we don't think that simply, because our category historically, our portfolio historically has been focused on value that because we now have products in laundry and litter, where our core products, our value. So the yellow box in litter, and the yellow bottle in laundry detergent, those are value products. But over time we offer premium products. And our consumer has traded up to them, and we've had other consumers and for other brands trade over to us. So again, in the end, I think for most consumer product companies, Innovation is always going to be the story in any environment, in any economy. So we feel very positive about those two innovations in particular.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And just an example, like for Deep Clean, it's mid-tier in the laundry category, that's still a value to the premium tier. So folks can still treat down to that. It's growing categories, though, because folks are trading down and trading up value in other areas. So net-net, we still think it's a positive in mostly economic environment.
Matt Farrell: And what was your gross margin question, Olivia?
Olivia Tong: It was just around mix more importantly and the impact of mix as time progresses, but I think you answered that within the top line question.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thanks.
Olivia Tong: Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. I'll pass it along.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Evercore. Your line is open.
Javier Escalante: Hi, good morning everyone. I wonder whether you can expand on the international business in the context of the increase in reinvestment in Q4, if you can flag geographies or brands that you are seeing most traction, and also whether there is any measurable contribution of the business that you acquired in Japan? Or is it just too early? And then I have a follow-up?.
Matt Farrell: Yes. I would say with respect to international, we're doing well like this, considering we have so many countries and so many brands, including region brands as the call goes out to our general managers in our subsidiaries. And so consequently, where we think we can spend to drive growth or position ourselves well for next year is where we're going to go. But I wouldn't say there's any one particular in international, one particular category or brand that, we would be over indexing on in Q4. It's just opportunistic spend.
Javier Escalante: Understood.
Rick Dierker: Another was Japan. It's probably too early to talk about that, Javier. I mean we're optimistic. It is a relatively small business, but we're excited about the opportunity to add a few, of our global brands into Japan to - it was a great team that is doing a great job at OXICLEAN. We think they can also do a great job, with a handful of other brands.
Javier Escalante: And the follow-up is on the legacy, let's call it that way. The Detergent business, Deep Clean doing well. Do you try - this is kind of like the second iteration that you go into mid-tier. You need the OXICLEAN detergent, I believe, and didn't pan out. So what is driving this success time around? Do you feel it's a consumer something with the competition from our friends in Germany, is that the retailers are more susceptible to this mid-tier, anything that you can that you can contrast relative to the OXICLEAN extension in detergent that didn't pan out as well as Deep Clean, that would be very helpful? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes, it's a fair question. I think it's a simple answer. OXICLEAN is brand, but it's an additive brand. And it was not a consumer - there was consumer confusion as we try to go into laundry, I just didn't make the connection. Here, ARM & HAMMER is well known for laundry, and just going up and down the tiers is a much easier proposition. That's why I think we're finding early success
Javier Escalante: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. As we think about some of your innovations next year and particularly around the VMS business, how should we be thinking about R&D spend and some of this extra innovation spend. Is there any risk to the SG&A, as we head into next year due to these investments? And then, anything else we should be considering? I think you called out some IT spend that, was a bit of a headwind. Anything else to consider for SG&A as we head into Q4 next year?
Rick Dierker: Yes. We don't - I mean, over a long period of time, we spent around 2% of SG&A and R&D, and that's been a pretty good number for us. Next year, we're implementing an SAP project, redoing our - updating our ERP system just - the last time we did that was 2009, which is time for an upgrade. But I wouldn't really qualify or call anything at this point in time. We'll do that in January at our Analyst Day.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Great, thanks.
Operator: And that was our last question. I will turn the call back over to Matt for any additional or closing remarks.
Matt Farrell: No, I think that kind of wraps it up for today. We're looking forward to seeing everybody at our Analyst Day in New York City at the Exchange at the end of January and until then go on.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-02 11:58:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Church & Dwight's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, who's our CFO and Head of Business Operations. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. So Q2 was another solid quarter for Church & Dwight. Reported sales growth was 3.9%, which beat our outlook of 3.5% and that was thanks to strong results across the board from domestic, international and Specialty Products. Organic sales grew 4.7%, which exceeded our 4% Q2 outlook with volume accounting for a very healthy 3.5% of our growth. Adjusted gross margin expanded 150 basis points. At the same time, we increased marketing spending, and we gained market share in the majority of our categories. Adjusted EPS was $0.93, which was $0.10 higher than our $0.83 outlook. That was a quality quarter, and Rick will take you through that later. The results were driven by higher than expected sales growth and gross margin expansion. And we continue to grow in the online class of trade with online sales as a percentage of global sales now reaching 21.2%. Now I'm going to turn my comments to each of the three businesses. First up is the U.S. consumer business with 3.8% organic sales growth. Volume growth was 3.3%, making this the fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth in the U.S. As you read in the release, Church & Dwight had the highest dollar consumption growth among our top 10 peers and five of our seven power brands gained market share in the quarter with a few hitting all-time highs. Now let's look at a few important categories in the U.S. Innovation is a big contributor to our success this year. And as I comment on the categories, I'll highlight the success of our new product launches. I'm going to start with laundry detergent. So ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent consumption outpaced the 1.6% category growth and achieved an all-time high record share in the quarter of 14.8%, which is up 20 bps. ARM & HAMMER unit dose, ARM & HAMMER scent boosters and extra liquid laundry brand, all grew faster than their categories and also grew share in the quarter. Regarding new products, we have launched two new products into the detergent category, ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean and ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets. The first, ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean, is our most premium laundry detergent entering the mid-tier of liquid laundry. ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean accounted for 40% of ARM & HAMMER's liquid laundry detergent consumption growth in the quarter and is highly incremental to the ARM & HAMMER franchise. The second new product is ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets which is a laundry detergent. ARM & HAMMER was the first major brand to offer this new unit dose form in the U.S. the last year in August. Since expanding the launch of this product into bricks and mortar retailers this year, we have seen high consumer interest in the form. Our ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets has proven to be highly incremental to both the sheets category and the total laundry detergent category, and we are seeing repeat rates increase. We feel great about the future prospects for this product and form. Now I'm going to talk about litter. ARM & HAMMER litter grew consumption 6% in Q2, which was almost double the category growth. Our new lightweight ARM & HAMMER Hardball Clumping Litter is outperforming our expectations as our share of the lightweight category has grown from 4.5% in Q1 to 8.2% in Q2. This is important because lightweight accounts for 16% of the Clumping Litter category, and so we expect Hardball to continue to grow in the coming quarters. Turning to personal care. The gummy vitamins business continued to be a drag on the total company organic growth in Q2. The gummy vitamin category declined 1.9% in Q2, which is an improvement from the 5% category decline in the past two quarters. The bad news is our consumption was down even greater. We were down 10.9%. We continue to move forward with our plan to stabilize our gummy business through new packaging, upgraded formulas to improve the consumer experience, new forms like chewables and greater marketing investments that we've talked about with you in the past. However, the improvement is taking much longer than we anticipated. Next up is BATISTE. BATISTE continues to see strong consumption growth with consumption up 14.5% in Q2, growing share to 47%. BATISTE continues to be the global leader in dry shampoo and innovation is very important to the success of this brand. So listen to this. This year, we launched BATISTE Sweat Activated and BATISTE Touch Activated dry shampoos. These products are bringing new users to the category. And already, these two new products account for a 2% share of dry shampoo and Sweat Activated is the number 1 new product in the category. Over in mouthwash, THERABREATH continues to perform extremely well. THERABREATH is the number 1 alcohol-free mouthwash and the number 3 brand in total mouthwash with a 17% share. This year, THERABREATH entered the antiseptic segment of the category with the launch of THERABREATH Deep Clean Oral Rinse. It's important to note that antiseptics represents 30% of the $2 billion mouthwash category, and our launch into antiseptics accounted for 100 basis points of our 400 basis point year-over-year market share gain in total mouthwash. So that's a great indicator of the future of the antiseptic launch. HERO continues to drive the majority of growth in the acne category and has grown to become the number 1 brand in the acne category with a 20% share. HERO continues to launch innovative solutions and patches combined with adjacent consumer needs. An example would be the recently launched Dissolve Away Daily Cleansing Balm. Now a few comments about private label. Regarding private label, the good news is our weighted average private label exposure is relatively stable. We have seen notable private label share gains in gummy vitamins, where private label gained 2 share points, achieving a 16.7% share, which is back to pre-COVID historical highs. This has also contributed to our difficulties in that business. In the litter category, private label share has increased sequentially in the last few quarters from 13.1% in Q4, 13.3% in Q1 and 13.5% in Q2. So current levels are historical highs. The good news is that it's a different story for us as ARM & HAMMER Litter continues to gain share in spite of the private label strength. I'll close my comments on the U.S. by saying that although consumption has been strong through the first half of the year, we did experience a slowdown in June and July. And for context, and you read this in the release, our categories averaged 4.5% dollar consumption growth through May of this year. But since then, it has been closer to 2%. Now this is not entirely a surprise as we expected a deceleration as year-over-year pricing rolled off. However, unit consumption also saw a deceleration from the first five months to what we saw in June and July. So it appears that the consumer maybe getting extended and is making choices around spending habits. While we have only seen this trend for the last couple of months, we expect that categories are likely to grow at a slower pace than we experienced in the first half of the year. And as you know, our balanced portfolio of value and premium offerings performs, I should say, is well suited to changes in consumer buying patterns. Turning now to international and Specialty Products. Our international business delivered organic growth of 9.3% in Q2. This was driven by strong growth in the subsidiaries as well as our Global Markets Group. And just a few call outs. We had strong growth in Canada, Mexico, Germany and our Global Markets Group. And finally, Specialty Products. Organic sales increased 3.9% and that's two quarters of solid organic growth for this business. We're confident that this division will achieve a 5% organic sales growth this year, which would hit our evergreen growth target. I want to wrap up my comments by reiterating that the company is performing well, all three divisions delivering strong growth. I want to thank all the Church & Dwighters out there for doing such a great job each and every day. And now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some more color around the quarter and full year outlook.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.93, up 1.1% from the prior year. The $0.93 was better than our $0.83 outlook and is a high-quality beat, primarily driven from higher than expected sales growth and gross margin expansion. We'll walk through the details of the P&L. But this was a strong quarter with 8% growth of profit before tax versus the prior year, excluding the tariff benefit. Other important highlight for the quarter was the majority of our brands gained share. Reported revenue was up 3.9% and organic sales was up 4.7%. Organic sales was driven by volume of 3.5% and positive price mix of 1.2%. Volume was the primary driver of organic growth, and we expect volume growth to continue for the rest of the year. And as Matt mentioned earlier, this makes four consecutive quarters of volume growth. Our second quarter gross margin was 47.1%, a 320 basis point increase from a year ago, reflected a one-time benefit on a favorable ruling and rebate related to historical tariff payments. Excluding this impact, adjusted gross margin increased 150 basis points due to productivity, volume and mix, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs. Let me walk you through the Q2 bridge. Gross margin components are as follows; positive 80 basis points impact from price, volume, mix and a positive 120 basis points from productivity. This was partially offset by a 10 basis point drag from currency and a 40 basis point drag from inflation. Moving to marketing. Marketing was up 20.2 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 10.1% or 100 basis points higher than Q2 of last year and led to share gains. For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A increased 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to international R&D and costs related to the Graphico acquisition. Other expense decreased by $7.8 million, primarily due to lower outstanding debt and higher interest income. For income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 17.9% in 2023, which is significantly higher than a year ago due to a high level of stock options exercised in Q2 of '23. We continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%. And now to cash. For the first six months of 2024, cash from operating activities was $499 million, almost $500 million, a decrease of 9 million with higher cash earnings offset by higher working capital. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately 1.80 billion. Capital expenditures for the first six months was 76.6 million, a 13.4 million increase from the prior year as capacity expansion projects proceeded as planned. We expect 2024 CapEx of approximately 180 million as we complete the majority of those investments that were initiated in 2023, and we continue to expect CapEx to return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025 and beyond. And now for the full year outlook, as Matt mentioned, strong financial performance in the first half of the year and strong categories and share gains. As we move into the second half, consumption growth has moderated in many categories as the consumer remains under pressure. Consequently, we are tightening our organic revenue outlook and now expect or getting sales growth to be approximately 4%, at the low end of our prior 4% to 5% range. Reported sales growth is expected to be approximately 3.5%, which also reflects a drag from currency and the impact from divestitures. We continue to expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of 8% to 9% growth, but now at the low end of the range. In round numbers, the sales call down would normally be offset by the gross margin raise at the EPS line. However, we have two other factors for the change. Number one, as you saw in the release, full year SG&A is now expected to increase as a result of higher spend for Graphico. That drag went from $0.01 to $0.02 as we make incremental investments. And then number two is dry powder in the event categories get more promotional in the second half. Turning to gross margin. We now expect expansion of approximately 100 to 110 basis points, up from our previous outlook of 75 basis points of expansion. We continue to expect an increase in manufacturing costs to be more than offset through productivity, mix and higher volume. We continue to expect marketing as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 11% as we continue to grow share across many of our brands. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll hear first today from Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So, Rick, I just want to, I guess, go back to your comments on the promotional backdrop. So, I would love to hear about what you guys are seeing right now on the promotional backdrop and then what your expectations are for the balance of the year?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Let me give you a sense for what's going on promotionally, Rupesh. And as everybody knows, the household is former promotional than personal care. But if you look at liquid laundry detergent sold on deal from Q1 to Q2. It actually was down 190 basis points year-over-year and was down 200 basis points sequentially. And you might be scratch your head about why would that be, but you guys probably have this in your Circana data as well. But a large premium brand is actually down 900 basis points sequentially and 600 basis points year-over-year. Of course, that's not the whole story. Couponing is not tracked. It's not in the consumption numbers. But that would explain how you went from 33.5 sold on deal in Q1 to 31.6 in Q2. So it was largely driven by a large brand. If you look at litter, Q1 versus Q2, that's a different story. Q1 sold-on deal was about 15.5% and Q2 was a little over 18% -- like 18.3%. So it's up sequentially. But it's -- that was generally driven by one competitor. They're sold-on deal Q1 versus Q2, almost doubled. It's 24% for this other brand in Q2. So, I would say, as far as our brands go, we've -- as I said, we had an all-time high share in the quarter in liquid laundry and also very close to an all-time high share for litter in Q2. But that's to give you a little bit of color on promotions. Unit dose is, it's kind of the same story as well, Q1 to Q2, just round numbers went from 26% to 31% on that's year-over-year, I'm sorry. But sequentially, it was -- went from 26% to 36%. So, there's a lot of big changes happening in each of the categories. But I would say, if you're just looking at the second quarter, you wouldn't say it's any more promotional. It's just an anomaly with one brand in liquid laundry and one brand in litter swinging the numbers.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Just going back to the slowdown in June and July. It sounds like it's across categories, but I don't know if there's any more color you can provide between your discretionary offerings and maybe some of your more essential categories.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, I can give you some color on that. We look at the commentary of food companies. And we see callouts like, hi, the consumers being price conscious, we've got value seekers out there. And then we look at fast food chains, and we see spending is less per trip. Then we look at our data, you look at staples and you see decelerating consumption in a lot of categories. I mean if you just look at the Circana and Nielsen data, you can see it. I guess the last thing here today is unemployment has ticked up a little bit. And as I said on the call, the expected -- the dollar growth year-over-year, we expected to peel back as a result of price increases lapping. But we're also looking at volume. It's a year-over-year volume growth is also decelerating in the categories. We're doing better than the categories as evidenced by our brand success. But we would say the consumer is likely a bit weary balancing the household budget, making choices to satisfy their needs. We have three things going for us. One is the strength of the brand. So, you saw in the release five out of seven brands grew share. If you went back to our old standard, 10 out of 14 of our major brands grew share in Q1 and in Q2. And so that's strength of the brands to be number one. Two is the innovation. You heard the proof points in my opening remarks. And number three, you know the split we have 60-40 between premium value. So therefore, we said, hey, given the category movement in June and July, we concluded 3% organic in the second half. It's probably a sensible outlook, but I can give you just some round numbers. So, if you look at the laundry detergent category, May, June and the first few weeks of July, May was around 2%, June flat and then July down close to one point, and that's just in dollars. And then again, the Litter category, round numbers, May was 3% up; June, flat; and then July, up slightly. And if you look at another category like non-alcohol mouthwash, who goes 14, 13, 11, May, June, July, you see how the categories are kind of trending down. And I can give you other examples, but that's where we come out and say, based on everything we're hearing from other industries, unemployment, what we've seen in the Circana and Nielsen data, it seems pretty obvious to us that 3% makes a lot of sense for the next 6 months.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And Rupesh, this is Rick. I would just, to tack on to that, it's not just one category. That's kind of what Matt is going through. If you take the weighted average and you look at every category individually, there is a slight deceleration in most.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you. I’ll pass it along.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Chris Carey at Wells Fargo.
Matt Farrell: Hi, Chris.
Chris Carey: Hi, guys. Rick, you mentioned, potentially keeping some dry powder for additional spending. Is that additional spending now factored into the outlook for the year? Or are you saying that you're now guarding a bit more of that dry powder should you need to deploy it in certain categories. And then what are the categories that you have your eye on, specifically, I think the Litter category, well take in the step up in promotional spending. I think we heard enough last night to corroborate that. But can you just expand a bit on the dry powder piece and just what you're kind of preparing for?
Rick Dierker: Yes. No worries. I would say, it's really the second in your example, it's dry powder is, if categories further decline, if the promotional environment heats up because volume growth gets harder to come by, we are just -- we're saying we're ready for it. We're prepared if that happens, we haven't deployed it yet, but if it happens, we will. And that's really primarily around our household businesses like laundry and litter. And then, of course, as the category is down for vitamins that would be applicable as well.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And the other thing is you heard us talk about the success we're having in so many categories with our new products and that's where we've concentrated our promotions, displays, et cetera, not just in the household but also in our personal care products. And we got the marketing coming behind it, too. We've got a lot more marketing in the second half behind those brands. So we definitely like our chances regardless of the slowing categories.
Chris Carey: Okay. Makes sense. One quick follow-up is just on the 3% and kind of thinking that's the right range for the next 6 months. Did I hear you correctly, it's a bit about category, which makes sense. You're gaining share. Where -- just given the trend line, where are you keeping a particular eye on regarding whether maybe by Q4, we're talking about 2% or something of the sort. I suppose your dry powder would help you counteract that. But any callouts on just the categories that you really have your eye on where things are developing a bit differently relative to your expectations? And then just connected to that, can you just frame the BMS business whether you're just seeing stabilization or whether there's any kind of sequential worsening. It's not really a BMS question, to be clear. But just given that's the business that feels less predictable, I just wanted to make sure I got a specific comment on that?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, we're in 16, 17 categories. If you just graft those categories and you just see pretty much across the board softening, so it's not just, hey, it's one or two big categories. We think it's really broad-based. So consequently they're all on the table for keep an eye on for the second half.
Rick Dierker: Framing the bottom in business.
Chris Carey: It was just on vitamin -- are you stable or is it faster than other businesses? Just maybe trying to ring- fence vitamins versus everything else where you're clearly -- you clearly had a lot of relative momentum for those categories?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, the category, I gave some numbers there before about May, June, July for a bunch of different categories. Vitamins if you do May, June, July category dollars down 1, down 2, down 1 at May, June, July. So it's more us than the category and we have not been able to renovate our portfolio as fast as we had hoped. And some of it is the retailers how much additional shelf-space will they change your shelf position et cetera. And some of it is also the speed at which we can renovate the portfolio. So I'd say it's more on us frankly than the external environment. We know we need to do and I think we think about how good we would be, if we could get that one turn around considering how all the other businesses are doing well, but yes it's more work to do there, Chris.
Chris Carey: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog at Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your organic growth guidance. Matt, I believe you mentioned that your guidance assumes the underlying category growth remains pressured, but does your guidance also assume further slowdown from here? Just trying to understand potential downside risk? And then how do you see the balance of price mix and volumes playing out, especially in the context of the category slowdown?
Matt Farrell: Yes, well, look it’s the categories has slowed down. Some of them, for example, laundry and litter you get to July pretty much flattish. So when you have flat categories, the only way you're going to grow is you have to take share. And we -- obviously we like our chances because that's what we've been doing so far this year with -- especially driven by our new products. A lot of our share growth in litter was driven by Hardball our new launch there. So now we're not saying, hey, this is going to -- this graph if you're going to graph it is going to continue to go down the rest of the year. We're just saying it looks like a step change from the first 5 months of the year to where we are now and I think it's more likely than not that it will stay this way to the rest of the year.
Rick Dierker: Yes. We still think categories are going to grow and we're going to take share. So that's how we get to our 3% for the back half. And then in terms of price volume mix it's kind of unchanged from what we've said before. We're primarily a volume-driven organic growth grower in the last four quarters and that will continue we think for the next two.
Matt Farrell: Yes. So this might help you too. If you look at dry shampoo, the dry shampoo first 5 months of the year was double digits I assume May was 12%. And if you look at June, July it's more like 6%, 7%. So category is still growing just not growing as fast. So it looks like it's just kind of a notch down. And this is where innovation is really going to matter I think going forward.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. That's helpful. And then my second question is on your marketing investment that you called out for Q3. I guess I'm curious to understand how much of that step-up that you expect in Q3? Is it essentially new incremental or is it really just a shift coming out of Q2 where your spend levels were a little bit below what we had anticipated. And then should we expect sustained spending levels into Q4? And I'm thinking about that in the context of some of your new launches?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll take that, Bonnie. So our Q2 marketing spend was right where we expected it to be. We were at 10.1%. If you take a big step back we spent quite a bit of marketing in Q4 in 2023. And we had one of our best new product years ever this year on par. And we're taking hundreds of basis points out of the marketing spending that would be naturally in Q4 if you kept it flat and putting that throughout the year. And so Q1 was up 150, Q2 was up 100, Q3 is going to be up significantly more like Q1 than Q2 and then Q4 will be down significantly because we just want to get that phasing correct to support new products.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you for that.
Operator: Next up, we'll hear from Peter Grom at UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. Maybe just one quick housekeeping. I think the release mentioned the domestic consumption outpacing sales, primarily due to some retail inventory reductions. Can you maybe just talk about that? Where did you see the reductions, what categories specifically?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So we said there were two reasons why Circana I would say 6% and domestic organic was 3.8%. So the 200 basis points of a disconnect it was one we had talked about before which was we had a HERO pipe in a year ago. And then the second one which actually was more of a surprise for us was retail inventory adjustment in the quarter. That was primarily on laundry, but I would tell you there's more noise in the system these days as categories start to move around from retailers on how they manage inventory. We are at good levels across the chain and we're set up for success.
Peter Grom: That's helpful, Rick. And then kind of going back to the category discussion, but maybe shifting gears to kind of international. Can you just talk about what you're seeing from an international perspective both from an underlying category standpoint, but also when we think about the 3% implied back half growth on a total company basis, what do you expect to see from your international business?
Matt Farrell: Yes. If you know our international business had a very strong first half. So we expect them to still punch above their weight for the full year. Our algorithm is international is going to grow 8% on an annual basis and they're tracking above that right now. Before I give you some remarks with respect to the U.S. consumer, we're still keeping an eye on the international consumer as well. So far things have been holding up pretty well. They've been more resilient at least in our markets and in our categories so far, but I think the commentary that I had before is more focused on the U.S. than international, but still it's something to keep an eye on, Peter. But right now, it's not a worry. .
Rick Dierker: And to just give you a little bit more granularity if our full year call for international is 8% we saw around 9% for the first half. So that would mean we think it's around 7% in the back half.
Peter Grom: Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Steve Powers at Deutsche Bank, your line is open for our next question.
Steve Powers: Okay. That was very enthusiastic. So the shipments versus consumption discussion that Peter just started, I guess just extend it, I guess I'm curious whether you have visibility any known timing differences favorable or unfavorable as we go into 3Q, 4Q?
Rick Dierker: Yes. At this point in time we don't have any I mean there are different classes of trade always talk about store closures or rightsizing and so all that's kind of baked into our outlook. It's a little noisier than normal I'd say. We've got caught by surprise a little bit on the one in Q2, but the good thing is we still -- despite that we still met or beat our outlook on organic.
Matt Farrell: Yes. So drug and dollar are the two classes of trade that a little bit turbulent I guess right way to say it, looking ahead, but we got a pretty good handle on what we have out there and how we think that will move around as a result of store closures.
Steve Powers: Okay. Great. And this is, I guess, it's on the topic we've all been talking about in terms of the slowing in the kind of promotional environment. But I guess it's more just a philosophical question in this moment. So many companies as we've gone through the second quarter earnings season that are exiting the first half with higher gross margins than expected yourselves included. Does that from your perspective raise the risk even more that seemingly rational levels of competition and what have you evolved alongside the slowing. It just seems like we're in a pretty precarious moment where so many companies have been calling for volume improvement or volume sustainability where things have been good. Now things are slowing abruptly, but at the same time they're carrying more gross profit into that moment. And I'm just questioning whether you think that elevates the risk versus what you've seen historically that things do get more competitive more quickly.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, look I think if people look back through history and you say when do people start promoting? And yes you're right when you have slowing categories. So that's why Rick said, it's probably prudent to say, hey, you got to have a top line call and a bottom line call that kind of bakes that in and so you have some dry powder if that were to happen, but that's why we spent so much time this morning talking about innovation. And we had an innovation beyond the categories that we described. So I think that's going to be really important to share growth and consumption growth in the next 6 to 12 months.
Rick Dierker: One thought to add to that. Normally, if you look back at history really hyper promotional environments happen when categories are negative or volumes are negative. Neither of those things are happening. In general, it's still positive growth from a dollar perspective and still positive growth from a volume perspective. So that's context. Private label shares are still relatively stable. All those things are still true, but we're just trying to give a heads up to say there is something going on.
Matt Farrell: Yes. So Steve, that's sort of our MO. We were always palms up and we see what we're seeing. So that's what we're doing today.
Steve Powers: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Dara Mohsenian at Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi. Good morning, guys. So I just wanted to touch on a couple of pieces of your portfolio. THERABREATH, obviously, continues to post very strong growth. You could see that in the scanner data or your call commentary on market share. But it is a higher-priced product. So just hoping you could give us a bit more detail on the brand performance. And as we move through the quarter, the performance -- any signs of trade down there is the therapeutic benefit of the product really mitigating any impact from a weaker consumer and just your view on growth potential for that brand as you look out over the next few quarters, given the strong momentum recently. And then just on the VMS side, I understand all your points around the intervention in terms of packaging forms, marketing. Just any more detail on when the timing of some of those things may pay off and how you guys think about that given the progress hasn't been as strong as expected so far. Thanks
Matt Farrell: Yes, we'll look at here, THERABREATH is a big success story for the company. As you know, we have 17% share, we're number 3 in the category. Number 1 is Listerine at 38% and Crest at 18%. And we've been getting more facings from different retailers and different classes of trade and the launch into antiseptic is something that we think is going to be a source of growth for us for a good long time because when -- 30% of the category. And we now have a 4% share of the non-alcohol, so we've got a long way to go there. So I would say, we feel really good about THERABREATH and yes, it's more highly priced, but that's not something new. We don't promote the product. I think one interesting proof point is, if you look at what happened on Prime Day, THERABREATH, actually, was the number 3 brand an unpromoted and we had a really good Prime Day for THERABREATH. So there's lots of indicators to say this brand has a lot of staying power even as a premium brand in this environment. And then with respect to vitamins. Yes, I think then that's probably going to be over the next 6 to 12 months. We do not expect we're going to be able to stabilize that as we had planned to when we started the year. We thought that in the first half, we'd be down and then by midyear, things start to turn around, so we would be exiting the year with a stable business, no loss of share. I don't see that happening right now. But we got lots of different irons in the fire here and some are working, some aren't. We just need a little more time.
Dara Mohsenian: Thanks.
Operator: Lauren Lieberman at Barclays, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Lauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning. So sticking with THERABREATH and also layering in HERO, if I may, both brands continue to have very, very strong growth, but they have decelerated. And we were looking at it more than anything else is kind of law of large numbers. But I was curious, if you could comment on what you're seeing in the spaces in which those brands compete in terms of those category growth rates changing? And as we look forward, this law of large numbers, like do we think they keep migrating down to earth so that growth, isn't 30%, but it's like 20% as we move forward and how to frame that because I think it's important in terms of the big picture, the aggregate outlook for the company is the growth rate of those 2 brands actually matters a lot.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, look, I'll give you some category data, like the acne category May, June, July is steady, up 8% May, June and July. So no worries there. And we've got the number 1 brand in the category, not only in the category but also in patches, subcategory at 54% share. So it's -- that's not a worry for us right now, either one of those brands. Of course, with the passage of time, you're not going to have 30% growth rates. This is just math as you think ahead to 2025. But we're still expecting that we're going to have really strong years next year.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And just to add to that, you're right, I think 30% or 40% growth. And as that comes down, it's because we're really lapping distribution in general, but consumption is just still extremely, extremely strong. And I would say, we're not going to point to a growth rate in the future, but we still have to be double digit, strong double-digit growth as we look out over the horizon.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, great. And then if I can ask a second question on market share trends. So we are still on Nielsen. So I know that there are some pretty significant differences lately between Nielsen and Circana and coverage matters a lot. So take that as preamble. But as we see it, market shares for Church in aggregate were softer in June and July. So along with the categories slowing that some of the share performance wobbled a bit, particularly if you take out here on Thera. Just if you could comment on that, again, that might be completely different than what you're seeing in your data. So I would like to know if that's the case. And if not, what is it do you think that -- why if in fact shares have been more sluggish why that is?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. I would just say that's not what we're seeing. In Q1, I think we were 10 out of 14. If you go back to our old vernacular of all of our power brands because this question a little bit more detail, so 10 out of 14, I think Q2 was 10 to 14. I think July -- June, July -- or July was 9 of 14. So no real change.
Lauren Lieberman: And what about the pace of that growth, though, not just like is it up, but is it up less?
Matt Farrell: Well, I think it's reflected in our second half call, right? We said we grew 5% organic in the first half, 3% in the second half. So I think that's all baked in the numbers but we wouldn't give like mid-quarter.
Rick Dierker: It's more of a -- that's more of a category. We still feel really good about the share. We expect share gains in the second half, and we're positioned to do that.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala at Jefferies. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi. If I could ask a little more on VMS, which is not that long ago, you were increasing capacity for the space. I'm curious if anything has changed, maybe there's some product changes you need to make or innovations you need to catch up on. But has your view generally about that segment changed?
Matt Farrell: Well, look, it's a very competitive category. They're well over 60 competitors. There aren't a lot of barriers to entry simply because you could find commands to make your product. So if you get an idea and catchy brand name, you can pretty much enter. So that's really what we've been experiencing. And of course, we've definitely struggled in the bricks and mortar. We do have some bright lights here on the online class of trade. So we're doing extremely well on Amazon, we've got a lot of growth there, but then that's a smaller piece of the pie. We've mentioned before renovating the category, meaning that we're -- this year, we've been changing the formulas to improve the consumer experience, meaning that taste and bite, we're launching into chewables, different forms. But all those have gone slower than expected. And then we haven't got a lot of help from the retailers.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And remember for context, right, this category grew through COVID on a rocket ship pace, it grew probably over 50% over four or five years. And so everyone's rush in to put the capacity in to accommodate that and the category itself is still finding its feet as it comes off of those highs. That's why we keep seeing negative growth. And then there's other forms now. It's just not hard pill and gummy. There's liquid. There's powder. There's other forms. And so that's a category story, and we're being impacted by that as well. But as Matt said, we think innovation is super important. We're trying to move the speed of light to get the right innovation out there as fast as possible.
Matt Farrell: Yes. We call it out because there has been a struggle for us. .
Kaumil Gajrawala: Yes, essentially, you're sort of -- when you first started talking about the category it sounds quite different from how you like to be positioned or how do you like a category to be positioned. Does it still make -- we just saw Clorox divested their VMS. I recognize it's different but does it still make sense to own?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, that's -- we evaluate all of our businesses, all of our categories annually. So obviously, we put a lot of investment into this but I can't go any further than that.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Andrea Teixeira at JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping to see if you can call I mean, shift a little bit of the conversation into M&A. And I know you've been looking at your Analyst Day, you had said you had looked at back last year around 4 potential acquisitions. None of those kind of future profile or enough to be attractive. So I was hoping to see what has changed anything that we should be thinking of? Is that more the targets are not willing or the private equity funds not coming up with some interesting ones for you? What is preventing you to growing organically, which is something that you historically have done? And then also just a housekeeping on WATERPIK. I think that's the only brand that we really didn't talk about and WATERPIK in dry shampoo just thinking of like how, I mean, you quoted in the first quarter there was a 1% headwind from WATERPIK and gummies each. So it's hoping to see what was the headwind in the second quarter, if any, assuming there's still headwinds there? And what is embedded in the second half?
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as M&A, you're correct in that last year, we looked at 4 or 5 different brands and we didn't pull the trigger on any of them. But what I can tell you is that we're as busy as ever right now. We're always looking at opportunities and they are out there and we just kind of stick to our criteria. But we do realize it's been 18 months since we made an acquisition. We have cash building up on the balance sheet as you'll see when we file the Q. But yes, we're very busy and the market is active.
Rick Dierker: And then on WATERPIK the good news on WATERPIK is consumption is up high single, low double digits. So we really work through that retail inventory issue that we talked about last quarter. I would say WATERPIK flattish for this quarter. We think it's slightly down for the full year largely based on what happened in Q1 from a sales perspective. So not ignoring WATERPIK but I'd tell you that consumption looks good for WATERPIK.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Filippo Falorni at Citi.
Filippo Falorni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the gross margin outlook for the second half. What have you embedded from a pricing standpoint that you're kind of comment on dry powder on promotional activities? And then from a commodity standpoint, are you seeing some modest inflation? What is the commodity outlook for the second half? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes, sure. I would say inflation is maybe a little bit higher than when we talked about it 3 months ago. Pulp and paper are up. HDPE is up a little bit ethylene's up a little bit. But no change from a net perspective as productivity has come out a little bit better as well. Yes, we do have some trade and couponing and promotional spending assumed in the back half. Again, it's dry powder, not necessarily that we are going to do it. And we also want to spend behind our new products in terms of displays and support and whatnot. So that's kind of our assumption.
Filippo Falorni: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Kevin Grundy at BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We covered a lot of ground most of the portfolio. I wanted to kind of take it a different direction, I guess. And maybe if you could comment at all on Barry's departure because it's an area we've got a lot of questions from recently. Obviously key executive with the company is CMO and President of your Domestic Business and probably one of a handful points of interface with the investment community. So Matt, maybe just comment on how high a priority it is to refill that role maybe skill set you might be looking for? I know you see this with the company through early October and whether the search is going to include both internal and external candidates. So thanks for that. Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: All right, Kevin, that's a multipart question many of which I can't respond to. What I can say is that Barry has been here 11 years, had an eight-year stint international, three in the U.S., a big part of our success and sad to see him go here through early October. It's business as usual here. So we have some time to figure out how we're going to fill the position. But I think that's as detailed as we go into on a call like this.
Kevin Grundy: Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong at Raymond James.
Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. My question is primarily around gross margin and trying to understand the upside in Q2. And then in terms of the deceleration in second half it sounds like that 100 basis points or so was primarily around the dry powder but wanted to see if there are other factors that are driving that expectation for a deceleration in the second half.
Rick Dierker: Yes, deceleration for gross margin?
Olivia Tong: Yes, exactly.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Okay. Well, in the quarter, we had favorability really because of mix. Within our personal care portfolio, we had higher-margin product sell even more than we expected and some of the lower-margin personal care products not sell as much. So that was kind of a tailwind from -- in the price volume mix line. That's what happened for the quarter. For the back half of the year, it's a couple of things. There's a little bit more inflation. It's not as favorable year-over-year personal care mix as those categories come in a little bit. But the dry powder we're talking about in terms of trading coupons in the back half as well. So those are probably the 2 or 3 things I'd point to in the back half.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Anna Lizzul at Bank of America. You have our next question.
Jon Keypour: Thank you. This is Jon Keypour on the line for Anna. I also just want to say I'm glad Steve Powers is here because he opened the way for the question I have, which is. I guess, on pricing is there any risk that the promo environment gets to such a place that we see negative price in the back half. And then a follow-up to that in terms of the innovation pipeline and like route to market and kind of time to market given where the categories are stabilizing at this lower kind of growth rate and the idea that maybe this becomes a '25 issue as well. Are you guys able to pivot your innovation pipeline and have new products in market by next year that cater more towards, I guess, the mid or low end consumer more than potentially what you had in the pipeline last year or expected to have in the pipeline for next year? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, there's two types of innovation. One is innovation where we're identifying a pain point or a need for the consumer. Another is when it comes to pack size which I think is what you're getting at. So yes, we're pretty good at pivoting quickly to create different price points in various categories in order to satisfy the consumer in a changing environment like this.
Rick Dierker: And then on your first question about volume and price mix as we look forward, we do not expect to have negative price in the back half of the year.
Jon Keypour: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Javier Escalante at Evercore.
Javier Escalante: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have a couple of clarifications on the detergent side. One is it that whether you have enough, you mentioned that Deep Clean was 40% incremental. Do you have enough data to know whether this is people trading up ARM & HAMMER? Or you're gaining share -- you're gaining users from other brands? The other -- I mean we both used to can and shows personal prices down. Do you think that that is promotional activity or that is a price correction?
Matt Farrell: Yes. On the first question, we fully anticipated when we launched the Deep Clean that you would have some ARM & HAMMER consumers' trade up. So Deep Clean is part of our good, better, best strategy. So good would be the basic ARM & HAMMER detergent and ARM & HAMMER with OxiClean is the better and Deep Clean is the best. So yes, we do have some data that as we have people trading up. And we also have consumers that are leaving other brands and migrating over to Deep Clean. And that's why we think, long term, Deep Clean is going to be a source of growth for the company.
Rick Dierker: Yes. We probably wouldn't comment much on looking at kind of data about Henkel or Persil or any of those things. We would just say we continue to gain share in laundry. And as the category is slowing a bit, we continue to gain share and do better in the market.
Javier Escalante: Understood. Fair. The other is curious about how fast this so-called dry powder can be deployed vis-a-vis retailers? And to what extent this is also contingent to supply chain, the strength of the supply chain because one of your competitors continue having issues with it. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes, Javier. It's a fair question. Typically, as you're putting in incremental promotions, that maybe is a longer lead time. But if you want to heat up a promotion, that can be done relatively easier and you go after incremental volume that way as well or couponing. But again, it's dry powder is the key message.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robert Moskow at TD Cowen.
Robert Moskow: You have a lot of analysts covering your stock. That's glad to be.
Matt Farrell: Yes. We're not doing an alphabetical order either.
Robert Moskow: But glad to participate. This year, it just -- as a newcomer, it looked like your new product pipeline was extraordinarily good. Like you have a lot of like really resonant products in a lot of different categories, all at once. As you think about it for next year, do you expect it to be as strong as it is this year? And in light of a slowing category growth and maybe some more value-seeking, is there anything you need to tweak in terms of the mix of premium versus more value-oriented products.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, one thing I want to keep in mind about new products is, we're having a great year with all these new product ideas we came out with. But remember, we're going to have Year 2 of these next year. So you only have a partial year, only building distribution this year, in many cases, building awareness. We think the products that some of the ones I talked about and others will be big drivers next year. And on top of that, we have new product ideas coming as well. So like I said, I do think that in any environment, but particularly this one, new products are going to make the difference. And then your other question was tweaking the portfolio between premium and value. I've been with the company for 18 years, and the 60-40 split, it's now 63-37 premium value has been sustained over a couple of decades. So unlikely that's going to change in the near term. And that's why we always like our chances when you have periods with change in consumer-buying habits.
Robert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our final audience question today comes from the line of Mark Astrachan at Stifel.
Mark Astrachan: Yes, thanks. Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here. Two quick ones. One, just asset prices on potential M&A, are you seeing it come down similarly to the market? And then on vitamins, just again, if you go back to when you bought the business, it was partly about adoption of the form factor of gummies there's more press out there not saying that I agree or don't agree with the efficacy of a gummy versus some other forms. Is that partly what's impacting the consumer in your business in gummies in general? Is there an opportunity to educate the consumer? Or is there opportunity and tech to make the product more effective? If not, how quickly can you pivot to some of the other stuff that you talked about in terms of chewables and potentially powders and whatnot within the brands you have?
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as vitamins goes, yes, there's been quite a change over time. I think we bought the business in 2013, the gummies represented 3% of the market, and now it's in the 20s. So it's changed quite a bit. I would say as far as your comment about efficacy, I think it's more that people are moving to powders and chewables and other forms. The larger vitamin category has pulled back. But remember, it's falling back from COVID. You had several years of growth in just a couple of years. So I think household penetration is greater as a result of COVID and that's kind of plateaued and started to pull back. But no, I wouldn't say that our issues are related to the fact that there's an issue with efficacy. It's more around the -- our own issues in-house.
Rick Dierker: Yes. The other area that folks are moving away from gummies at times are from a sugar perspective. They want to go towards sugar free. So we're rapidly going after the sugar-free part of the portfolio. We're rapidly going after improving our taste profile. So that gap widens again versus competition.
Matt Farrell: Yes. So one of our disadvantages is we don't have as what brought a portfolio of sugar-free as some of our competitors. And again, that's one of the areas when I talk about renovating the portfolio. That's one of the areas we're focused on. All right, operator, I think we are at the end of the line.
Operator: Correct. No further questions from our audience today.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thanks everybody for joining us. We had a kind of a great first half. We're looking forward to a strong second half, and we'll talk to you all at the end of the third quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference call. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Church & Dwight's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. 
 I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir. 
Matthew Farrell: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open the call up for questions. 
 Q1 was another solid quarter for Church & Dwight. Reported sales growth was 5.1%, beating our outlook of 4%, thanks to stronger results across the board from domestic, international and specialty products. Organic sales grew 5.2%, which exceeded our 4% Q1 outlook with volume accounting for a very healthy 70% of our growth. 
 Gross margin expanded 220 basis points. At the same time, we increased marketing spending in the quarter and gained market share in the majority of our categories. Adjusted EPS was $0.96, which was $0.11 higher than our $0.85 outlook. The results were driven by higher-than-expected sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate.
 We continue to grow in the online class of trade with online sales as a percentage of global sales now reaching 20.5%. In March, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire GRAPHICO, our Japanese distributor for approximately $35 million. We expect the acquisition to close later this year. GRAPHICO's annual sales are approximately $38 million. The business is based in Tokyo and has 59 employees. 
 Since 2008, GRAPHICO has partnered with Church & Dwight and driven OXICLEAN to be the #1 powder prewash additive in Japan. The acquisition is expected to contribute to greater expansion of our business in Japan and the greater APAC region. We intend to leverage the capabilities of the GRAPHICO team to bring additional Church & Dwight brands to Japanese consumers. 
 Now I'm going to turn my comments to each of the 3 businesses. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business had 4.3% organic sales growth, 3.3% that was volume driven, making this the third consecutive quarter of U.S. volume growth. 5 of our 7 power brands gained market share in the quarter and private label market share in our categories remained relatively stable. 
 Now let's look at a few important categories in the U.S., starting with laundry. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent consumption was flat while the category grew 2%. Many of you may recall, we had pulled back on promotional activity in Q4, and that continued into early Q1. As our promotional activity normalized, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry saw share gains late in the quarter and the brand has continued to perform well in April. Now elsewhere in laundry, ARM & HAMMER unit dose and ARM & HAMMER scent boosters both grew faster than their categories and grew share in the quarter. Our XTRA liquid laundry brand, which is our extreme value offering grew consumption 6.3% and increased market share to 3.8%. 
 Regarding new products, we have launched 2 new products into the detergent category, ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean and ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets. The first ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean is our most premium ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent entering the mid-tier of liquid laundry and delivering a superior clean at a price consumers can afford. 
 The second new product is ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets laundry detergent, which is launched -- which was launched online in August of 2023. ARM & HAMMER was the first major brand to offer this new unit dose form in the U.S. Now due to its online success, Power Sheets is now available in select brick-and-mortar retailers. Power Sheets continues to grow online. It now has 9,000 reviews with a 4.5 rating, and both Deep Clean and Power Sheets are off to a great start in 2024, and we're excited about the early results we are seeing. 
 Now over in Litter. ARM & HAMMER Litter grew consumption 5% in Q1, which was in line with category growth. Our new lightweight ARM & HAMMER Hardball Clumping Litter is now expanding nationally after a successful in-market test in 2023. We expect this new litter to help ARM & HAMMER capture a greater share of the lightweight litter category. 
 To give you a couple of facts here, lightweight litter today accounts for 16% of the clumping litter category. Our share of lightweight clumping litter has grown from 4% to 6% since year-end 2023, but that compares to our 29% share in regular weight litter. So still a long way to go. 
 Turning to Personal Care, BATISTE continues to see strong consumption growth with consumption up 19% in Q1, growing share to 47.5%. BATISTE continues to be the global leader in dry shampoo. We are meeting consumers' desire for long-lasting results with the launch of BATISTE Sweat Activated and BATISTE Touch Activated dry shampoos. And so far, consumers are posting excellent reviews for both of these new innovations. 
 Now our mouthwash. THERABREATH mouthwash and HERO continue to perform extremely well. THERABREATH is the #1 alcohol-free mouthwash brand and is now the #3 brand in total mouthwash with a 16% share. THERABREATH recently entered the antiseptic segment of the category with the launch of TheraBreath Deep Clean Oral Rinse, which represents 30% of the category. 
 HERO continues to drive the majority of growth in the acne category and has grown to become the #1 brand in the larger acne category with 19% share. HERO continues to launch innovative solutions in patches combined with adjacent consumer needs, such as recently launched Dissolve Away Daily Cleansing Balm. 
 Now there are 2 businesses, Gummy Vitamins and WATERPIK that created a drag on total company organic growth in Q1. First, WATERPIK. The good news for WATERPIK is consumption for our water flosser business is healthy. However, flosser shipments were affected by retailer inventory adjustments in the first quarter. This, combined with lower shower head consumption accounted for a 1% negative drag on organic revenue growth but we expect this to be transient. 
 The second is gummies, which also created a 1% drag. The Gummy Vitamin category declined 5% in Q1, which was actually worse than our expectations for the category and our consumption was down even greater, down 12%. We continue to move forward with our plans to stabilize our vitamin business through changes, through packaging, messaging and greater marketing investments that we've talked about with you in the past. 
 I will close my comments on the U.S. by saying that overcoming the drag from these businesses still -- and still posting a 5% organic sales growth for total company, just illuminates the strength of our portfolio. 
 Turning now to international and Specialty Products. Our international business delivered organic growth of 8.8% in Q1. This was driven by strong growth in the subsidiaries, just a few callouts, especially Mexico, Germany, U.K. and France. And also had growth from our Global Markets Group. And finally, Specialty Products. Specialty Products organic sales increased 7.2% primarily due to record sales in our [ Eurasia ] business as SPD continues to expand globally. 
 I want to wrap up my remarks by reiterating that the company is performing well with all 3 divisions delivering strong growth. And I want to thank our global employees for their great efforts each and every day. Now we rarely raise our full year outlook after only one quarter. But given our fast start, we raised our outlook for gross margin and EPS growth, and we have confidence in our new full year forecast. 
 And now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some more color around the quarter. 
Richard Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.96, up 12.9% from the prior year. The $0.96 was better than our $0.85 outlook, primarily driven from higher-than-expected sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate. Reported revenue was up 5.1%, and organic sales were up 5.2%. Organic sales were driven by volume of 3.7% and positive product mix and pricing of 1.5%. 70% of our organic growth was volume driven. And as Matt mentioned earlier,  this makes 3 consecutive quarters of U.S. volume growth. 
 Our first quarter gross margin was 45.7%, a 220 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to productivity, volume, mix and pricing, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs. Let me walk you through the Q1 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive [ 130 ] basis points impact from price volume mix and a positive [ 130 ] basis points from productivity. This was partially offset by 10 basis points from currency and 30 basis points from inflation. 
 Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $29.7 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 10.1% or 150 basis points higher than Q1 of last year and led to share gains. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $20.9 million, a $2.2 million decrease primarily due to lower outstanding debt and higher interest income. We now expect other expense for 2024 to be approximately $80 million. 
 For income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 19.9% compared to 24.4% in 2023, a decrease of 450 basis points due to a high level of stock option exercise in Q1 of 2024. We continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%. 
 And now to cash. For the first 3 months of 2024, cash from operating activities increased to $263 million, a decrease of $10.1 million with higher cash earnings, offset by higher working capital. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $1.050 billion, up slightly from our previous $1 billion outlook. 
 Capital expenditures for the first 3 months were $46.3 million, a $21 million increase from the prior year as capacity expansion projects proceed as planned. We expect 2024 CapEx of approximately $180 million as we complete the major capacity investments that were initiated in 2023, and we expect capital spending to return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025. 
 And now for the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year 2024 reported an organic sales growth to be approximately 4% to 5%. We now expect full year EPS in the range of 8% to 9% growth. This is up from our previous 7% to 9%. And is inclusive of costs related to the exit of the MEGALAC business as well as GRAPHICO transaction costs. We now expect full year gross margin to expand approximately 75 basis points, up from previous range of 50 to 75 basis points. Given our outstanding Q1 margin expansion of 220 bps, this outlook implies moderate gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. 
 We continue to expect an increase in manufacturing costs to be more than offset through productivity, mix, higher volume and carryover pricing. We continue to expect marketing as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 11%. 
 SG&A is now expected to be flat as a percentage of net sales compared to 2023, reflecting the investments we are making in our international, e-commerce, infrastructure and costs related to the GRAPHICO acquisition Matt discussed earlier. 
 For Q2, we have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of approximately 3.5%. Organic sales growth of approximately 4%. We had a really strong April from a consumption perspective. So some might be expecting a higher organic growth outlook. Our 4% outlook reflects higher coupons and trade promotion in support of new products. We're fully lapping 2023 price increases and we're lapping a year ago distribution gains for HERO. 
 Moving on to the rest of the P&L. We expect moderate gross margin expansion in the quarter in Q2 as we have less of an impact from carryover pricing. Increased marketing spending to support our innovation pipeline, higher SG&A expense and a significantly higher tax rate of 24% compared to the prior year of 17.9%, which benefited from a high level of stock option exercises. This represents a roughly $0.07 drag on EPS. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.83 per share, down 10% versus last year adjusted Q2 EPS. 
 And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Christopher Carey: Just regarding the Q4 outlook for organic sales to be below the run rate that we're seeing in the scanner trends, Rick, you mentioned trade promotion lapping of HERO -- or excuse me, I think the THERABREATH or HERO distribution gains, if you could confirm that? How would you contextualize the drivers of those 2 items for the organic sales outlook in Q2 being below what we can see in the consumption trends? And then got you a follow-up. 
Richard Dierker: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. You're right. April was around 6.5%  consumption growth, really, really strong. And we said 3 things really driving a lower organic outlook of around 4%, which is probably in the grand scheme, HERO, lapping year ago distribution gains as we went national for HERO. It was probably the biggest one. 
 And then number two, not getting any contribution from pricing, we've fully lapped 2023 pricing actions by -- as we enter into Q2. And then the third one would be higher coupons for -- and trade for supporting our new products because this is one of our best years of innovation. 
Christopher Carey: Okay. That's helpful. The second thing would just be we're seeing an improvement sequentially in laundry volumes. Obviously, there's been some noise in this category with compaction with stepped-up promotional activity in the year ago base. How would you characterize your expectation for laundry sequentially from here? 
 Clearly, we're seeing the improvement as those lapse normalize, would you expect to continue to see that improvement going forward? And do you just have any expectation for how volumes might shape up in laundry specifically over the next couple of quarters? 
 And if I could sneak in, are you starting to see any competitive activity in your litter business, which is what we're hearing from one of your competitors? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. You got a lot of questions there Chris. 
 Yes. So if you look at laundry category, you got -- there's a lot going on there. You've got liquid laundry, you got unit dose and you got scent booster. So if you look at the categories, the last 3 quarters for each of those, liquid laundry sort of decelerated year-over-year growth, Q3, Q4, Q1, it's like up 5%, [ up 2, up 2 ]. 
 And so it has decelerated. The reason we feel good about where we stand right now is we know we lost some share in the -- early in the quarter, then we normalized the trade spend. And then we're going to have even more couponing and trade going forward. Why? Because of we got Deep Clean that we've launched nationally. So -- and we think that -- we make that stick in high mid-tier and that could provide years of growth for us. So I think the horse to ride this year and laundry is going to be Deep Clean. 
 As far as unit dose and scent boosters go, unit dose, that's decelerated as well the last 3 quarters, [ 8, 5, 3 ]. But we -- our unit dose grew 34% in the quarter. So we had a lot of success, a lot of trade down going on there. 
 And then scent boosters, which is a very discretionary category, the last 3 quarters is [ 2, 1, 1 ] as far as the year-over-year growth. And we grew 7% because we're a value in that category. So we're in a good position, both in unit dose and at scent boosters. So then when you talk about the promotional things are right now. 
 Look, liquid laundry, if you went to Q4 versus Q1, it's up a bit, like up 70 bps. So just as in measured channels, of course. And of course, you can't see coupons as well. I feel good IRI and Nielsen. But if you look at the sold-on deal, it went from 33.2 to 33.9 sequentially. So you wouldn't say, well, that's not that big a move. But year-over-year, Q1 to Q1, it's up 180 bps. 
 So we would still say that if you go back to pre-COVID times, if you went back to, say, 2018, it's about a 40% sold on deal. So we're a long way from being where we used to be. But I'd say trend-wise, you do a trend line, you'd said it is inching up over the last 6 to 8 quarters. 
 You mentioned litter as well. Litter is same sold on deal in Q1, Q4 it's 15.3%, but still up year-over-year 40 bps, but a long way from where it was. 
 If you went back years ago, we would more around 20%. So -- but it is -- obviously, we had one competitor that was out of stock for a while, so they'll need to -- I suspect, be promoting to win back -- win back share. But as I said, we've -- the horse we're riding there is a Hardball. We've got a lot of opportunity in the lightweight litter category. So that's -- you had a long question, so it's kind of a long answer, did I hit most of the points, Chris? 
Christopher Carey: That's perfect. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Also congrats on the nice quarter. So just going back to the vitamin category. Just curious what continues to weigh in the category? And then how should we think about expectations for the balance of the year versus, I guess, the double-digit consumption decline we just saw in Q1? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, if you look at the category, Q4 and Q1 just round numbers are both down 5%, down 5%, down 5%. And normally, you would expect New Year's resolutions and people wanting to get healthy, that would be a boost to the category. We didn't see it in Q1. So it was 2 things. It still is probably the tail from post COVID. 
 But also, you could also argue that for many people, it's discretionary. So the third thing though is that people moving from gummies to other forms, and that is powders and also things like chewables. And we're launching a chewable this year. So we could see some of that shift to other forms. But I would say those are the dynamics that we're looking at. 
 Now as far as our performance, yes, we've had double-digit decline in Q4 and Q1. So obviously, not happy about that. Takes a while to turn that around. You probably are starting to see new packaging in in-store. Not only new packaging but higher marketing spend as well. 
 We are seeing signs of retailer support with respect to shelf placement and facings pre and post resets. So we hope that this is the year we're going to stabilize. We're really hoping that in the second half of this year that this business will inflect and start to grow. But we've been down Q4 and Q1, as I said. 
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up for Rick. So you guys raised the bottom line guidance, but still kept the same top line guide even with the Q1, and it sounds like strong momentum in April. So just curious in terms of -- is it just conservatism for reaffirming the guide? Or is it still just early in the year? 
Richard Dierker: Yes. I think Matt's comment was spot on in his prepared remarks. Usually, after Q1, we don't touch the outlook. Gross margin was so strong in Q1, we felt like we had to reflect that. And as a result, earnings was very strong as well. 
 So that's why we adjusted it. And 4 to 5, I think it's a great guide. I know we said 4.5 pretty much throughout the year. So I would expect us to talk more about the outlook in July. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. 
Dara Mohsenian: So first, just a clarification on WATERPIK. The 100 basis point issue you mentioned in Q1, is that something that fully comes back in the balance of the year? Is that embedded in the Q2 guidance? Is it more spread out in the balance of the year? And was that just a shipment issue? Or is there some form of retail sales weakness also? 
 And then maybe just broader, Matt, on the U.S. business, you're obviously excited about innovation this year. You mentioned the couponing in Q2. Can you talk about the level of contribution you're expecting from innovation this year? And maybe on some of the key early ones, the reception you're seeing so far from a trade and consumer standpoint? 
Matthew Farrell: Okay. A multi-parter. Well let's pick WATERPIK first. I'll make a few comments about that, and Rick can build on that, and we'll come back to what we're expecting for the U.S. .
 As far as WATERPIK goes, yes, it was down in the first quarter, but we still expect on a full year basis, this business to be up and to hit its plan. So I wouldn't be completely alarmed about the WATERPIK activity in Q1. The fact that the flosser consumption is healthy, is real positive for us. That's a really strong way to start the year. 
Richard Dierker: Yes. I mean consumption for WATERPIK is high -- up high single digit, low double digits. So consumption is great. We had to work through some inventory that was higher than I guess, at retail, and that's been worked through now. So we feel like it's in a good spot as we move forward. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And as far as our expectations for the year, we called the 4% to 5% organic growth for the year. And we expect just ballpark, about 2% of that driven from new product launches, which is a big number.
 And -- but if you kind of roll through, we've got Deep Clean launching in laundry. And ARM & HAMMER, we're going national with -- ARM & HAMMER Litter, we're going national hwith HardBall. Those are our 2 big businesses on the household side of the house. And then when you get into personal care, THERABREATH, launching with the -- antiseptic being 30% of the category, that's gigantic. So we're only just getting started there. 
 And the BATISTE, I mentioned, we're the #1 dry shampoo in the world. You got BATISTE Touch, BATISTE Sweat. If you're getting really high ratings and early days of velocities for virtually everything that we've launched are meeting or exceeding expectations. So that would suggest we feel good about at least after 1 quarter, that we're going to hit that 2% number for organic sales growth in 2024. And that will probably be one of our biggest years ever for as contribution of organic sales from new products. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. 
Andrea Teixeira: So I was hoping if you can talk about like the dynamics as you set up shelves. If there is anything you would call out in terms of the -- of any pull forward in shipments and consumption? I understand that obviously, you had a very strong quarter, but you're guiding more conservatively into the second quarter. 
 Just trying to understand the puts and takes or anything that you see the lapse, and I appreciate when you gave us the lapse on some of the components last year. But also, if you're seeing your competitors being more I would say, more aggressive in litter or things like that, that some of them had suffered from, obviously, the cyber attack and all of that. How are the dynamics in terms of market share as we think into the second quarter and the balance of the year? 
Richard Dierker: Andrea, it's Rick. I'll give you a couple of comments, and if Matt wants to add. So first of all, for the Q2 call, I went through a little bit of the details. But really, it's  new product couponing and trade promotion is kind of a little bit of a step down or step up in Q2, so that's impacting net sales. 
 We had year ago HERO gains as we went national, that's what I said before. And then we're lapping some of the price increases, right? Almost all of our volume -- all of our organic growth from here forward is almost 100% volume driven. Okay? So we had 70% in Q1, but as we move forward, it's closer to 100%. 
 And then as for litter, Matt went to the amounts sold on deal, it has ticked up a little bit. Private label is up a little bit more, spending is up a little bit, but by and by our shares are strong in litter. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And as far as you mentioned, supply difficulties of other competitors. Yes, sure. Obviously, we and other brands in the category can benefit and have benefited from that difficulty. And when you have a repeat purchases over and over again. Oftentimes, so changes stick. 
 So naturally, that's our expectation that, yes, we're going to hang on to some of those new consumers that moved our way, but some will be tempted back by promotions. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Modi with RBC Capital Markets. 
Nik Modi: Just 2 quick questions. Rick, maybe on just the marketing guidance. I guess based on our math, the rest of the year would imply kind of reduced marketing, of course, off of very big increases from a year ago. But just wanted to get kind of philosophically, do you kind of saw the upside, would you have a bias to reinvest more given the consumer environment or -- would it be more flowing through to the bottom line? 
 And then the second question is really around reinflation, right? We're starting to see some commodities across the energy complex reinflate. And I would just be curious on kind of how you think about managing that against this consumer backdrop in terms of pricing? 
Richard Dierker: Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. For marketing, we were up 150 basis points in Q1. We expect to be up in Q2. And then Q3 and Q4, but Q3 up probably, and then Q4 down. And why is that? We spent a lot of marketing in Q4 a year ago. We wanted to move and shift part of that to the front half as we supported our new product. So we did that in a meaningful way. Feel really good about that. 
 On an absolute basis, marketing in Q4 would still be a high number. So we feel like we're supporting, the brand is great. To the extent that we overdeliver and have the momentum. We typically look to reinvest in marketing because it drive share. It drives organic growth, and it's a virtual cycle. 
 On inflation, I would say for us, it's largely unchanged. Inflation expectations aren't moving much at all. Ethylene is down a little bit HDPE is up a little bit. But net-net, we're right where we were when we talked 3 months ago. 
 So we don't have -- if there's a theoretical question, if there's inflation, what do we do? I would tell you, our productivity program is very strong right now, and we think that's going to be evergreen as well. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And just to add to that, Nick, as you know, we got a portfolio value brand. So to the extent that interest rates stay where they are, we have some defense against that. We have found that HERO and THERABREATH are really high [ ranks ], but we've really been unaffected by any decline in consumer sentiment over the past few quarters. So they seem to be somewhat resilient, and those are some of our bigger growers right now. So we still think we're pretty well positioned at least for the remainder of 2024. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. 
Peter Grom: I was hoping to just follow up on the 2Q organic sales outlook, Rick, you mentioned fully lapping pricing. You touched on the couponing many times throughout this call. So within that 4%, can you maybe unpack what we should expect from a price versus volume perspective? 
 And then kind of the same question for the full year. I think previously, the expectation was that volumes would be kind of 2/3 of the full year organic sales growth. Has that changed? Or is that still the right expectation? 
Richard Dierker: Thanks, Peter. In Q1, it was 70% volume and 30% price. And I just made the comment that on a go-forward basis, Q2, Q3, Q4 they'll likely be closer to 100% volume and minimal price, if anything. 
 And if you rewind the clock, pre-COVID, you go back 10 years ago, and that was our track record, 100% volume-driven growth. And actually, sometimes in the past, it was maybe 110% volume-driven growth and a little bit more trade as we went national for some of our brands. 
 So that's the expectation as we look forward. And so for the full year, I probably wouldn't change the outlook we gave you on the mix. 
Peter Grom: Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on Dara's question. Just kind of on WATERPIK and the fact that you expect it to kind of reverse and grow for the year, a pretty nice rebound. So just maybe thinking about the sales benefit from a brand perspective? Just in that you overdelivered versus the full year outlook despite that drag?
 What really gets worse from here? Is it simply just cycling the tough comps and moderating growth of HERO and THERABREATH or are there other brands where you're kind of expecting things to slow sequentially? 
Richard Dierker: No. Look, we think the -- not much changed from our original outlook. And we beat the quarter on organic sales growth and despite some of these things that were dragging us down. It's just early in the year to call any incremental upside, and we typically don't do that.
 So let's see how consumption goes, and we continue to do well on a share perspective. And I think we're very optimistic about the year and the top line. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. 
Anna Lizzul: What's the solid volume growth that you saw in Q1? I was wondering if you're seeing a more significant benefit from trade down. I think you mentioned some in laundry in response to Chris' question, but wondering if you're seeing this elsewhere as well? 
 And then we've been hearing from some companies, earnings season that the lower-income consumer appears to be more challenged. I was wondering how you're thinking about sort of the broad health of the consumer across your different income tiers in relation to your categories and volume growth? 
Matthew Farrell: Well, with respect to the consumer, you've probably heard us say on other calls that our big barometer is always unemployment. And unemployment has been consistently low. Yes, the interest rates have risen, but they've been high now for a while. So we don't see any change other than maybe people are disappointed that they're not coming down as fast. 
 So yes, and there's -- we all know that student loans started to restart as well. So there's other pressures on the consumer. The credit card debt is rising, delinquencies are rising. We're all looking at the same data, but that's going to be translating down into consumption for our products. You've seen the first 4 months of the year. 
 I think that's probably because of -- it's got -- you have to go category by category and brand by brand. So like I said earlier, I do think we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. Yes, what was the first part of your question? 
Anna Lizzul: Just wondering if you're seeing broad trade down. You mentioned some in laundry, any other categories? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, look, the predominant portion of our portfolio that is valued is laundry and litter. And in laundry, we have -- obviously, we have ARM & HAMMER, but we also have XTRA, an XTRA group in the first quarter, it was in my prepared remarks. So we feel real good about that. And that may be an indication of more pressure on the consumer when you see the deep value brand growing. 
 And then over in litter, yes, we have both a high-priced litter, meaning premium litters, we call it the black box. And we have the orange box, which is value. So we keep people in the category. So-- people may trade down, but they'll trade down within ARM & HAMMER, which actually supports our top line.
 So like I said before, we have some good dynamics in those 2 big categories that we think are going to help us for the remainder of the year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. 
Bonnie Herzog: All right. I had a quick follow-up on Laundry. Curious to hear how you guys think about managing the balance between driving share and profitability? I guess I'm thinking about it as you step up trade spend and also as you -- especially as you look at it in the context of curtailing some of the ineffective promos you mentioned earlier. 
Richard Dierker: Bonnie, it's Rick. I just want to be really, really clear. In Q4 of last year, we didn't repeat some bad promotions. And that carried over a little bit into January, and then we were pretty [ palms up ] about that. 
 We have a great balance between what we think the right trade spending is and the right growth. And we're just getting back to what we would say was normal before we kind of called some of those bad promotions. So it's not like we're hiking up trade spend to the above category levels or anything like that. We are just pumping it back from an artificial low. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Our practice generally is we're generally below the category average and liquid laundry from a sold on deal perspective. 
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just had another question on international business. Your sales growth in the quarter was quite strong at nearly 9%, and the growth really seems pretty broad-based and balanced. So just curious to hear, how much of the volume growth was driven by distribution expansion versus just maybe strengthen your existing markets? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I think one of the things to point to in international and you're right that all 6 subsidiaries grew as well as the GMG. So clearly ran the table. But what we're seeing the benefit of is that we're being very selective about what brands we're going to support and what retailers we want to grow with. 
 And we're leveraging revenue growth management far more than we had historically. And that's true in the last [ 18 ] months, and it's really showing up in the first quarter. In the past, you may have heard us talk about Global Markets Group, it's grown 15% annually for a lot of years as well. And they -- there was a Global Markets Group that generally would be driving the international number. Well, that's not true in Q1. 
 Q1, it's subsidiaries that are driving it. And it's for those 3 reasons that I gave being selective with respect to brand, with respect to retailer, and using all the tools of revenue growth management. 
Richard Dierker: Yes. The second thing that's helping international is a couple of these new brands, HERO and THERABREATH. And typically, it takes us 2 to 3 years to get new brands, new acquisitions out internationally, and we're doing it rapidly, and there's been a great response to many countries and many distributors for those brands. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. We think that will build throughout the rest of the year. But that's a nice tailwind on top of what I said in my earlier remarks. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: I wanted to ask you about the GRAPHICO acquisition and what drew you to that? Is there other markets that have distributor relationships? And does that seem like an area where you may be interested in more deals? And then just on thoughts on your -- on the M&A environment overall, particularly in goods, what you're seeing and interest there? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, if you go back a few years, the way we got established in Germany was, we had a very small distributor that had introduced BATISTE into Germany. And that while, that being the basis for starting a very small subsidiary in Germany, which has grown over time. This one is different in that, GRAPHICO is a public company in Japan, obviously, a micro cap. 
 But they have been working with OXICLEAN for 25 years, even before that Church & Dwight bought the business back in 2008. And they have a very capable team that's driven the brand to be number one, prewash, additive, and powder and Japan. And so we benefit them from getting just [ buying ] a critical mass of talent in Japan and now we can introduce our other products into Japan. 
 Keep in mind is when you're -- oftentimes, we have multiple distributors in a country because some distributors are households, some are personal care, they're experts in different areas. And this enables us to concentrate our brands through one subsidiary. 
 Will there be other distributors in Japan? Yes, there could be a couple of others, but this is one where we can have a base of operation. We should have a -- this should be a really big business for us given the size of the economy and the population of Japan, but also its a really nice beachhead for us in Southeast Asia from which to grow. So we're really enthusiastic about it. We've got a great team that we're -- that's coming on board as a result of this acquisition. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: And then just thinking through about the M&A environment overall? 
Matthew Farrell: Well, look, you know we're always on a hunt. Its the highest and best use of cash for the company, where we have a disproportionate amount of our cash that goes towards acquisitions. And there's always something for sale, but that's about as far as I can go right now. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: Great. And then just one on -- following up on Bonnie's question around promotion. You talked about it continuing to creep up, but still obviously well below pre-COVID norms. Is your expectation that it does get back there or just continue to show creep through the year? And then on the couponing, still point of clarification, is this more than normal or more a function of the timing of new products and the trial building couponing that goes with that to support the launch? 
Richard Dierker: Yes. That's really more on your second question, it's more of your second explanation. It's incremental couponing to support higher and more new products is the short story. On the -- on your first question on amount of promotion and really trade spend. I think it's -- same that we told Bonnie. It's -- the forward look for promotion for laundry is always dependent upon how category growth is doing. And if category growth is stable, then normally, promotion stays in line. And right now, category growth is great. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes, one thing to keep in mind, [ Bonnie ], is -- all its price increases that went through the last couple of years, they were really unusual for all CPG and food companies. So yes, that does obviously make it more expensive for the product, but didn't necessarily expand gross margins for people.
 So yes, I don't -- like Rick said, we have to react to what's going on in the category. So you can't really predict or we're certainly not going to telegraph what we might be -- our plans might be for the remainder of the year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. 
Lauren Lieberman: I was curious in thinking about the gross margin progression from here and for the rest of the year. One of the things you called out with regard to sales slowing down, particularly starting next quarter, was that lapping on distribution gains from HERO? So I was just -- what we can see in Nielsen, which I know isn't representative of the full distribution of the brand. Is that like, let's call it, same-store sales still really, really strong?
 But is some of the slowing down that's implied in HERO also impacting that gross margin forecast going forward? Because I imagine and we know it's super accretive. And so I just want to think about -- talk about how to think about the contribution of HERO to that gross margin build as we move from here and start to lap the distribution? 
Richard Dierker: Yes. No problem, Lauren, this is Rick. That isn't really in our thinking as we move forward. The 2 things that are driving gross margin to maybe not grow as fast would be less carryover pricing, and I know what I talked about from the organic revenue side, too. So we're fully through all the carryover pricing.
 And then number two, we talked about it during our Analyst Day in January, we're adding more fixed cost to the system for capacity reasons, like new distribution centers, those are coming online as we move through the year. So those are the 2 things. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. 
Javier Escalante Manzo: I do have a follow-up on the gap between retail sales that we see and the reported domestic number. You flagged WATERPIK as a point of impact. But we use [Ocana] and I believe that you guys do too. And the retail takeaway is more about 7%, 8%. And so there is a little bit of still kind of like a 2-point gap. Do you think that it's related to a slow retailer reorders as your competitor in laundry mentioned earlier in the season? And I have a follow-up. 
Richard Dierker: Yes. Are you comparing Q1 when you're -- for your question, Javier? 
Javier Escalante Manzo: Correct. Yes. Correct. Exactly. Correct. Just trying to understand whether is this something of the accounting of the couponing or something weird that basically we are overstating your retail sales growth and therefore, your shipment growth? 
Richard Dierker: Yes, I got it. No. It's interesting. I know we all have similar databases. Our -- internally, our shipment number, of course, is [ organic sales ] is 4.3%. And then IRI, our number is around 6%. So our gap is closer to 1.5%. Part of that is the couponing. Part of that is the water pit consumption that we've talked about working through retail inventory. And yes, I mean, those are the 2 biggest pieces. 
Javier Escalante Manzo: And when it comes to the gross margin getting better than expected, and I know that price mix was an issue -- was the driver. Is it more kind of like the change in the portfolio, meaning richer sales from HERO and THERABREATH, what was the driver of the better gross margin are there for the earnings bit? 
Richard Dierker: Yes. That's a good question. I think it was really the 2 things. It was -- mix was a little bit more helpful and volume was helpful. I mean price came in as expected. Manufacturing costs came in as expected, productivity was in line. So it was really higher volumes, which help with throughput and efficiencies and then a little bit favorable mix. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Filippo Falorni with Citi. 
Filippo Falorni: I want to follow up to your point of the cycling of the distribution gain for HERO and maybe extend it to THERABREATH as well. Can you comment like how much incremental shelf space are you getting this year compared to last year in the U.S? And then I think at CAGNY, you talked about more international opportunities for those brands. So maybe can you give us some sense of the potential contribution from international? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Okay. When you think about THERABREATH and HERO, THERABREATH, we bought that business in 2021. And HERO in 2022. So for THERABREATH, resets this year, we're getting more doors. But I would expect that the distribution gains from a number of doors perspective is going to plateau for THERABREATH this year, and that we're going to be getting -- the way to look for distribution gains in the future are going to be more facings. 
 And we are seeing that already from some existing retailers where we already have good distribution, but maybe not the amount of facings -- we deserve. And then innovation, which will, so I think more facings and innovation are going to drive future growth for THERABREATH once we plateau with respect to the number of doors. For HERO, since we've owned that a little bit less a year less than THERABREATH, there's still some distribution gains to come with some decent-sized retailers.
 But we expect this the same thing to happen. But with respect to HERO, what we'll be starting to do is start to move from just patches and acne into adjacent consumer needs, such as skin care, pre and post acne. And you mentioned international. So international is an area where we're running to launch HERO and THERABREATH. HERO, we're planning on launching in 40 countries in 2024, and that will happen throughout the year. 
 And then, of course, the sales growth will start to build in future years. But I think the other thing that's probably worth pointing out is that both HERO and THERABREATH are high rank products. And so if you're a retailer, you really like a high rank product which is a growing brand. And consequently, you do want to give that brand more facings and listen to innovation. So we think the dynamics for each of those brands are going to bode well for growth not only in 2024, but in 2025. 
Operator: Our last question will come from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. 
Brett Cooper: I was hoping to dig more into the HERO business in the U.S. So distribution is up significantly, making sort of the underlying read of demand a bit difficult. So I was hoping you could click one level below and say, and talk about what we're seeing with respect to existing consumer demand, new users, trial and repeat and other drivers? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Could you -- I didn't hear the first part of your question, I'm sorry. 
Brett Cooper: Just -- it's the HERO business in the U.S., right? So huge distribution gains, right? So you see significant sales growth. So just trying to understand, I guess, one level below, kind of what you see from consumers that have been in the business for a while and then what you're seeing with respect to new users, trial and repeat and any other drivers on the sales growth? 
Matthew Farrell: Look, the volumes for this business continue to grow. So it's not a price-driven business. And the awareness in household penetration is still ahead of us for this brand. You may remember that when the -- back in -- before patches hit the scene, it was really ointments and lotions et cetera, that people were using to address acne. 
 It's patches now that are driving the category. And our ability to grow is going to be going into adjacencies. 
Richard Dierker: And I would probably say in all channels, we are growing and have positive growth even in channels that are declining because of some maybe macro or secular trends. So that bodes well for this brand. 
Operator: That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Farrell for any additional closing remarks. 
Matthew Farrell: Well, thanks for joining us today. We had a great quarter. So let's see everybody in July. 
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-02 12:00:00) =====
Matt Farrell: Okay gang. It's a little bit like the Academy Awards. We're going to be hearing cutlery and clinking of plates and whatnot. All right. Thank you. Welcome, everybody. This is our 2024 Analyst Day, and we got all of our sell-side analyst friends in the room and lots of major shareholders. So, let's begin. We have a Safe Harbor statement. Encourage everybody to read that after class. And I'm going to start -- virtually the entire management team, one of the best-looking management teams in CPG. I'm sure you'll agree. And we've got kind of a packed agenda. I won't read it to you, but got a number of people coming up, are going to talk to you today about financials, our new products, digital and also our international story. So, here's a quick look back to 2023. So, we had a great year for reported and also organic growth, our reported 9% and organic 5%. And we had gross margin expansion of 220 basis points. You can hold the applause for a minute. We had all-time high shares in a lot of our major brands, share gains. Marketing spending historically has been around 11%. We almost got all the way back to 10.9%. And we generated $1 billion in cash from operations. And finally, as you know, we've been investing in capacity for laundry, litter and vitamins and also adding to the capabilities of the company. And here's our TSR. We show this to you every year, one, three, five and 10 years, especially what matters to our shareholders. 2022 was an abysmal year for us and we've recovered 2023. And we got a lot of confidence going forward, which you're going to walk out of the room here today thinking this is that. We've got a lot of confidence in our ability to grow in the US. You see that we tweaked our evergreen model in our press release, so we're expecting 3% growth in the future in the US. International, we've tweaked that there to say we expect 8% growth internationally going forward. We have a wonderful lineup of new products in 2024, but we've been consistent in our innovation for many, many years. We're becoming more and more digitally-savvy. So, one of the markers for that would be what percentage of your sales is online? And the answer is 20% of our sales is purchased online. That's over $1 billion in sales. The new evergreen model is very healthy. I'm sure you're going to leave here today thinking that. We've got really strong fundamentals going forward. So, who are we? We're a $6 billion company, largely US. You see 78% domestic and 17% international. Specialty Products is our original business from back in the 1840s. Historically, we've talked to you about 14 power brands, and those 14 power brands account for 85% of our revenues and profits. But today, as you saw under our release, in the future, we're going to narrow our communication to investors and shareholders and analysts to seven of those 14. And those seven are ones that are in larger categories, and we also believe they have a lot of potential for our global growth. So, those are the seven, THERABREATH, VITAFUSION, HERO, of course, ARM & HAMMER, our biggest brand, WATERPIK, BATISTE, and OXICLEAN. And they account for 70% of our revenues and profits. So, I'm going to run through what our winning formula is. First off is we have a very balanced and diversified business. We have low private label exposure, great innovation as you're going to see here today, and we are an acquisitive company. For many, many years, we've said the highest and best use of our cash flow is to buy brands. All right. Here's the balance. We're pretty much 50-50 between household and personal care. As far as value versus premium, historically, it's been 40-60 between value and premium, because of the growth of THERABREATH and HERO that shifted a little bit, but it's still pretty solidly around 40-60. Low private label exposure, this is on a weighted average basis, it's around 12%, and it's been like that for many, many years. Category-leading innovation. Barry Bruno is going to take you through a lot of the innovation group, things we're launching in 2024. And we have a long history of acquisitions. So, if you went back to 2004, we had $1.5 billion in sales, and now we almost have $6 billion in sales in 2023. And our acquisition criteria is very specific, so we're very fussy about what we're going to buy. They have to be number one and number two brands. They need to have high-growth, high-margin brands, fast-moving consumables, asset light. We have to be able to bring something to the party and leverage our supply chain, our internal capabilities, and they have to have a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. All right. So, we've got seven of those power brands today and more to come. And here's our -- I'm just going to wrap it up here just to remind you. Balanced portfolio, I think it's really key to the long-term success of this company. Low private label exposure. We don't have new exposure that some of our peers do. Innovation is the reason why our brands are so successful and the reason why our brand equity grows year-over-year. And finally, we're an acquisitive company and we do it well. But I'm going to bring up Rick now to take you through the financials.
Rick Dierker: All right. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to talk to you about the quarter, the full year, which we finished really strongly, and also our outlook and our evolved evergreen model. So, first, the quarter. Our outlook was 5% from a net sales growth perspective. It was 4% organically. We came in at 6.4% and 5.3%, so just better in the top line all around. Gross margin, we just had expansion. We came in at 260 basis points, expanding versus a year ago. And then EPS was up. So just green arrows all the way. For the full year, similar story. We had 9% as an outlook for the top line and 5% for organic. We came in at 9.2% and 5.3%. Gross margin, we had expected to be up 210, were actually up 220, as Matt mentioned. And then EPS reported and adjusted are both better than we expected. Cash flow, $1 billion was our outlook and we came in at $1.30 billion, so just strong cash flow all the way around. All right. So just I'm going to spend some time on the evergreen model. So for many, many years, we've been going through, and I begin and end almost all my presentations with the evergreen model, because that is the backdrop for the company. Organic net sales of 3%, gross margin expansion of 25 basis points, flat percentage for marketing higher dollars, and then we leveraged SG&A by 25 and that's how we got to 50, and that led to 8% EPS growth. And that's what we've been saying year-after-year-after-year. And we're evolving it today. And we're going to say 4%. For the last 10 years, if you look back at our history, we've been growing 4%. But we're saying we have confidence in the future and we're going to continue to grow at 4%. I'll get into that detail in a second. But the divisions would be 3% domestic, 8% international and 5% for SPD. Gross margin, we also think that this is the time that we are accelerating on productivity. Inflation is starting to moderate, and we have some fast-growing acquisitions that we've done that are helping -- that are tailwinds to gross margin. Marketing, same story, flat percentage but higher dollars. And as we grow faster, that just means we're going to invest even more dollars in marketing to help gain share and to help grow our brands. SG&A we're going to leverage, maybe not as much as in the past, but still leverage. And in that number, we're now investing largely behind international and largely behind e-com, and we'll get into that detail in a second, too. So operating margin still expands 50 basis points and industry-leading growth of 8%. That's the new model. So let's just go through the detail a little bit on organic. What gives us confidence? Well, we're in fast-growing categories, and Barry will show you, as we talk about those seven, they're extremely fast growing. We want to take share and we do that through marketing, through innovation, and we've done that year after year after year. THERABREATH and HERO, recent acquisitions, are fast-growing and international growth is accelerating to 8%. On the gross margin side, again, productivity is outpacing inflation. We have higher-margin acquisitions on the marketing side, and Surabhi is going to talk about it. We're getting good ROIs in our spend. That transition is helping. And then we have higher dollars as we grow the top line. And then SG&A, we're putting in systems all over the world. Put in a China ERP system, we're putting in an ERP system for our GMG business based out of Europe. All these investments are embedded in our numbers. We also are building capabilities around the world, regulatory, back office to support this fast-growing business called GMG within our international. And then analytics and e-commerce, those are capabilities we want to build. Okay, moving to 2024. So I just talked to the new evergreen model. The outlook is actually a step-up from that. The outlook is 4% to 5% on the top line. It's 4% to 5% organically, excluding MEGALAC, excluding currency. Gross margin up 50 to 75 basis points, so to step up again from our evergreen model. SG&A is leverage, operating profit expansion is higher than our evergreen model, 60 to 80. Tax rate is a little bit higher and EPS growth of 7% to 9%, and our cash from operations is $1 billion-plus. Now, we do have some timing within our EPS outlook. So the first half is essentially flat, and the second half is where all of our EPS growth is coming from. Why is that? Well, we're purposely moving marketing spend from the second half to the first half, because we have one of the biggest new product introductions in major categories in our history. And Barry is going to walk you through what each and one of those are. But we're excited about that. We're going to go ahead and spend the money upfront to drive trial, drive awareness to do that. And then the second point is we had a great first half in 2023. The first half of last year was a strong comp to compare against. We had 11% EPS growth last year in the first half. How do you think about -- or how do we think about EPS growth? Well, 8% to 10%, if we strip out the MEGALAC, again, we're not excluding MEGALAC. It's included. These are the shutdown costs. These are the stranded costs. So adjusted EPS growth before MEGALAC is 8% to 10%. MEGALAC impact is a 1% drag. That's why we get to 7% to 9%. If you think about the tax rate, that's also a headwind of about 2% for operating performance. So we're really strong operating performance is what I would want to leave you with for 2024. Let's look at our track record. Ten years of growth. Last year, net sales growth grew 9.2%, one of our strongest years ever, and we're going to have 4% to 5% growth on top of that growth in 2024. Organically, long track record again of above 4%. So the median for 2024 is 4.5% or the average. And we're going to -- that's better than our 10-year average better than our new evergreen model. So to have 4.5% or so above the 5.3% is, again, growth on top of growth. And it matters where that's coming from. In years past, before all the COVID noise and all the pricing and the inflation, we're a volume-driven company. 100% of our organic growth was really from volume. Many companies right now are talking about the return to volume. We've already returned to volume. The last two quarters consecutively, we have volume growth. We expect that in 2024 as well. About two-thirds of our growth we expect to be volume-driven growth in 2024. On gross margin, this is a slide to spend some time on. So we had a fantastic gross margin expansion, 220 basis points in 2023. That got us to 44.1%. Our eyes are on our high of 45.5% back before COVID, the 2019 number. If we hit the middle of our 50 to 75 basis point outlook, then that means we have 80 bps remaining to get back to that kind of pre-COVID number. Now we also have tailwinds from acquisitions that we didn't have back then. But our eyes are firmly on recovering back to 45.5%. And that's also why we have confidence and raised our gross margin outlook for the next few -- for the future. Here's the bridge. So this is always the detail that folks want to see. 2023 price/volume mix as expected, very strong tailwind from price. In 2024, not as much. We have some carryover price, but it's not the driver. Manufacturing costs for a headwind of 240 basis points last year. We expect that to be closer to down 130, down 140, about $85 million. It was about $125 million in 2023. Acquisition is a tailwind in 2023. We don't expect to have acquisitions in 2024 from carryover impact on gross margin. Productivity programs up 150. That was one of our best years ever. It was our best year ever for our productivity program. And then in 2024, we also expect to have a really strong productivity program. Gross margin change would then be 220 in 2023 and then 50 to 75 in 2024. I'll spend a minute on manufacturing costs. Inflation is still there. I would say it's moderating. So maybe a few months ago, I would have said inflation, I would say it's moderate inflation. And the nuance in 2024 is a small piece of that is commodity-related. And whether it's resin prices or natural gas or sugar, those costs are up. But the bigger part for Church & Dwight is some of the costs and investments we're making in capacity. So the new depreciation on the capital that we've put in. We added a new distribution center. We're outsourcing international supply in some cases until we can bring it in-house. We have higher third-party manufacturing costs and higher labor costs. So that's the bigger makeup of the pie, largely capacity driven as we grow into it. Moving to marketing. So 11% with 4% to 5% net sales growth, this is an investment of $35-or-so million. So this is real incremental dollars year-over-year to help drive the top line and share. SG&A, we continue to believe we're going to leverage SG&A. And I walk through even in the future evergreen model, leverage of 25 basis points to 0. So those investments behind international and e-com are key. And all that leads to great consistent strong EPS growth over time, double digit in many cases, or high single digit, and we have a great outlook in 2024. Turning to cash flow. So cash flow is what we believe drives value. And our free cash flow conversion, which is free cash flow divided by net income, is industry-leading. So for 10 years, our average was 119%. In our recent history, because we're making huge capital investments on CapEx, that number is down, but still right in line with the industry or maybe even a little bit better. But we expect that to continue to inflect positively. Our cash conversion cycle. This has been a track record at Church & Dwight. We've taken our cash conversion cycle from 52 days down into the 20s. We had a spike up this year largely because of acquisitions. But again, that's going to work its way back down over time. Strong balance sheet, one of the strongest positions we've ever been in. So we ended this year at 1.8 times levered. We expect to end next year closer to 1.6 times. And this chart is updated. So even from a few months ago, back in September when we presented at Barclays, our financial capacity is about 20% higher. And why is that? It's because we're generating even more EBITDA. It's because we're generating and paying down cash at such a rate we're paying down debt as well and so those things are just, again, virtuous cycles when we look at doing acquisitions and deals to grow our business. So number one, far and away for capital allocation is M&A and we're laser focused on M&A. Number two is CapEx for organic growth and our Good to Great program. Number three is new products. Number four, debt reduction, and number five, return cash to shareholders. We're not a capital-intensive company. We spiked up in 2022, 2023 on the way down in 2024, and we believe we'll be at 2% of sales back to normal in 2025. Then finally, we announced this morning in the press release, we have a 4% dividend increase right in line with our capital allocation strategy. And I'll turn it over to Barry to talk about the domestic division and new products. Thank you.
Barry Bruno: Good afternoon, everybody. I think Rick likes when I go right after the dividend slide to remind me I've got an obligation to keep it going, so 123 years strong and some more good quarters ahead. So I'm Barry Bruno. I'm responsible for our US business. I'm going to talk a little bit about our categories, the US consumer and what I think is some really great innovation that we've got in our key categories going forward. I'm going to start with a slide I left you with last year, which was we've got great confidence in our future. If you look at the categories in which we compete, and I'll show you a look at the old power brand and the new power brand categories to break them out for you, we're not only leaders in those categories. We're driving growth in those categories. We thrive in difficult environments. You've seen our value percentage of our portfolio. I'll take you through how, on ARM & HAMMER in particular, we bring consumers in tough times, we keep them, we trade them up. And then acquisitions have a ton of room to run, HERO and THERABREATH have been absolutely home runs, and they're in the early innings of that story still, and I'll show you what that looks like. So this slide was getting a little complicated, right? This is our old 14 power brand prior look, 17 categories. As we got into new categories, the chart got longer and longer. You can see which in 2023 we're growing, mid-single-digit growth, high single-digit growth, pretty strong. But when you look at the new look of our seven power brands and these compete in eight categories, just as a reminder, ARM & HAMMER competes in laundry and litter, of course, seven brands, eight categories, incredibly strong growth, right? 11% in 2021, 18% in 2022 and then 16.9% on top of that. And we're driving a lot of that growth and I'll show you that in just a little bit. But these are exciting healthy categories to be in. Matt talked about these a little bit, too. So our portfolio has changed a little over time. So we're 63% premium, 37% value, still incredibly valuable to us in tough economic times as we bring consumers in and low private label exposure of 12%. And then the third reason for confidence is about these new acquisitions. When we met with you over the last two years talking about THERABREATH and HERO, it's been about our ability to build distribution to bring these to more and more consumers, and you can see the success that we're having. THERABREATH up 57% in terms of distribution last year and lots of room to run to catch up with the big guys, and HERO is another great story as well, up 200% last year and tons of room to keep growing. And that's just in MULO, that's in measured channels. If you look at it from a numerator standpoint, mouthwash is in 63% of US households today. THERABREATH is only in 7%. And you can see the growth we're making from 1% to 2% to 3% to 4% to 7%, great growth, but there's a ton of households where we're not in just yet. And so there's room to run there. And HERO is the same story. HERO almost didn't exist five years ago with a 0.2% household penetration, up to 6.4% today. You can see the rate of growth accelerating. So whether you measure MULO or you measure numerator households, tons of room to run on acquisitions. So let's look at some category and consumer dynamics. Now, we're going to start with our largest brand, Arm & hammer and one of our largest categories, Fabric Care. And the look back is a pretty compelling story of growth from a five share to an all-time share high, 14.4% last year on top of an all-time share high in the prior year. And all of that growth has been driven, as we've talked with you, about being anchored in the value tier of the laundry detergent category. That's about 30% of the category. But I'm happy to be talking today about Arm & Hammer Deep Clean, our most powerful formula and our first entry into the mid-tier segment. And to give you some idea, that's about 27% of the category. The mid-tier, we haven't played there today. And we're thrilled about this new formula that's going to be launching in Q1 in 2024. And just to break it out for you, so you can see our architecture, we've got our core Arm & Hammer products. Those are our better products, Arm & Hammer plus OXICLEAN, sorry, Arm & Hammer Good, Arm & Hammer plus OXICLEAN Better and now with Deep Clean, our best formula and the best anchor in our architecture. And we are telling consumers about this new formula starting very soon, and I'll play one of the spots. We call it dig deep to show you how we're bringing awareness to the category and the brand. [Video Presentation] So that's just one way we're spending some of the incremental marketing that Rick talked about earlier. But fabric care is so important to us, we're not done with Deep Clean. We're also happy to be talking about Arm & Hammer Power Sheets, laundry sheets, not dryer sheets. We're the first mainstream brand to bring this form, new form of unit dose to market. We launched it in Q4 of last year online. We quickly grew to the number two detergent sheet on Amazon, and we're expanding it into bricks-and-mortar this year. It's a great new form of unit dose. And there's a lot of education that needs to take place when you've got a new form, so let us show you how we're using one of our army of influencers to educate consumers about this great new form of unit dose. Let's play the spot. [Video Presentation] Once is enough. You can tell she's excited about it. We are too. I just dropped my son off at college a few weeks ago, and laundry sheets were one of the first things that I made sure I packed for him. Far more convenient than unit dose for sure, and than liquid for sure. So staying with ARM & HAMMER, moving over to Cat Litter, now another important multibillion-dollar category for us. You can see that the category is healthy, right? It was up 11% last year. It's been a consistent grower for a long time. During COVID, there were increased pet adoptions, then there were multiple rounds of price increases, 11.7% growth. ARM & HAMMER contributing to that growth, up 11.8% last year. When you're growing faster than category, you're gaining share, of course. We were up to a 24.8% share, almost a 25% share of the category. And you can see we've been a consistent growth over time from 23.6% up to 24.8%. And one way that we're keeping that growth going is through new products, ARM & HAMMER Hardball is what we're talking about today. We're changing the lightweight litter experience. We think it's lightweight perfected, ultra compact strong clumps, 60% lighter than our base product today, plant-based, and it was one of the strongest-performing litter new product launches at Walmart last year. So we're expanding it nationally this year. And why are we so excited about lightweight? Well, today, we've just got a four share in the lightweight subsegment versus our 25% share overall. So getting our fair share equals $100 million opportunity in retail sales. So we're squarely focused on growing and gaining share in this important subsegment of the category. And we'll share how we're doing that via a piece of advertising right now, which is cats watching humans on the Internet. So, a little bit of a different play. Let's play the spot.  [Video Presentation] I swear we test all of our advertising and our cat-obsessed consumers love it, so it's helping to bring awareness to this great new product. All right. Switching gears to something slightly different, dry shampoo. BATISTE dry shampoo has been an absolute tear. The category is healthy, up 15.6% last year. As the leader in the category, we were up 16%, a combination of new products and advertising has absolutely driven continued growth for us. And you can see the share story is the same here, whether we're talking about litter or fabric care or BATISTE, we're hitting all-time share highs. We hit a 46.3% last year. We're up 9 share points in the last few years, so incredibly strong growth continues here. And again, the theme is the same. We're keeping it going with new products that we're supporting by advertising. Now we're talking about BATISTE Sweat and Touch Activated, our newest innovation in dry shampoo. They use bursting bead technology that have been in skin care before but never in dry shampoo, so they do -- they offer a burst of fragrance with every touch or drop of sweat for up to 24 hours of freshness. Those are launching starting now in Q1, both forms. And we think they're pretty futuristic. So we've engaged some help from the future to tell the story about this new product. Let's play the spot. [Video Presentation] So I have a lot of fun with BATISTE, as we approach a 50 share in the category and keep innovating and investing. VITAFUSION. It's a slightly different story when we talk about VITAFUSION vitamins. So once made VITAFUSION unique, our gummy form, our great taste, our wide assortment has now become really prevalent in the VMS category. There are over 60 vitamin players in the gummy form right now, and that's just in bricks and mortar. There are over 100 if you were to look at online players. So ultimately, there's been a share decline, but you've seen it's gone from 23.9% down to 12% in the category. The gummy category has just about doubled during that time, and you see a real inflection back in Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 during COVID. But obviously, the share decline is going to stop. And we're making the investments required to do just that because our consumers and our customers depend on us to do that. We're the number one gummy player still Amazon, at Walmart, at Walgreens and all the players you see listed here. And we've got the highest household penetration in the gummy form. But we've got to turn it around. And so we're investing in new product upgrades, to our base formulas, to new packaging that pop better at shelf. We're taking that new packaging into new displays to get off-shelf display. We've got new advertising to support it. And we're launching new forms beyond gummies in 2024 with the whole goal of stabilizing the business, stopping that share decline and getting back to growth in 2025. Now I'm going to close out talking about just a few acquisitions. So I'll start with THERABREATH, and I think this THERABREATH story is pretty well known. 85% growth last year, right? Incredible growth, driving category growth of 12.8%. So healthy category, again, driven by THERABREATH where we're now category leaders. And you can see the share growth is absolutely playing out. This is in the total mouthwash category. We've gone from a 2 share to a 13 share in the alcohol-free portion of the category where we play, 26 share category leader. And actually a fun fact in January, alcohol-free for the first time is larger than the alcohol segment of the mouthwash category. So we are continuing to gain share and grow dramatically here. And it's a similar story where we've got a great new product, introducing THERABREATH Deep Clean, our first alcohol-free antiseptics and antiseptics 30% of the category today, we don't play there at all. Deep Clean is our first foray there. Kills 99% of germs with no burn because there's no alcohol and it's dentist-formulated launching in Q1. I don't have any great advertising to share with you here because the team just got back from LA last night, but we'll have it for those of you who are going to be at CAGNY as it supports our launch in Q1. And last but definitely not least is a little brand called HERO. And it's not so little anymore. You can see that it's absolutely driving category growth. We're up 72% last year, drive category growth of 20%. And when I say little, it was at 0.2 share five years ago. Right now it's an 18 share all-time category, high-end category leader in acne care. And we're absolutely keeping it going innovation in both our patch form. We're a leader with over a 50 share today. And in acne-adjacent skin care, where we're launching Dissolve Away, our Daily Cleansing Balm. So patch innovation, combined with skin care innovation equals lots of good growth yet to come.  So let's talk about patches for just one more second because the form is still not all that well known in the US. We've got the first national campaign called pimple -- your MIGHTY PATCH bringing awareness to this great new form, let's play that spot. [Video Presentation] Again, the form is new so we're pioneering in the industry, launching the first new advertising nationally to bring awareness to this forum. So the summary is great momentum, right? You heard about all-time share highs in laundry and cat litter, on BATISTE, in mouthwash and in acne care. We've got great new products. We're supporting with more advertising. And ultimately, that brings us back to the algorithm that we were talking about earlier. You see we've raised our target to 3% for the US. And we're absolutely confident we can achieve that. seven out of the last 10 years, our US business has been growing faster than 3%. And we're absolutely committed to continuing to do that going forward. One way we're doing that is via digital and e-commerce. And so Surabhi Pokhriyal is going to come up now to talk about how we're going to keep that great growth going. Thanks.
Surabhi Pokhriyal: I'm Surabhi Pokhriyal, I'm the Chief Digital Growth Officer here at Church & Dwight. So quick context setting because I know all of us are consumer goods users but not always fancy. Some geeky things might happen here, so keep me honest as I present to you. I want to say that we are not in the business of getting consumers to shop online. We are simply in the business of being where the consumer shops, and that happens to be online more often than not. With that said, 70% of purchases in the US specifically are digitally influenced. What that means is every time you pick up that six-inch device out of your pocket, look up your iPad, you are making purchase decisions not just to buy online but walk to the store, look up a review online and make that purchase. That's what digitally influenced means. Also, we are in the era of channel-less commerce. So the consumer is very fluid between buying in brick-and-mortar store, buying online or making that 2 a.m. order to get the product delivered to the door, maybe sheet. So it's important to segregate how the physical shelf is very different from the digital shelf. The physical shelf is set once a year, maybe twice a year and it is set it, forget it. The digital shelf like this time-lapse video shows you changes by the second. So our tactics really have to cater to the online world in a very different manner. Let's talk some numbers, and Matt broke the thunder for me. We go from 220 in under seven years, right? That's the kind of e-commerce penetration we are seeing for our categories. It's important to say here that we have seen a sustained post-COVID momentum in almost all of our categories where the consumer wants who has decided and chosen convenience doesn't want to give it back. Think about getting your letter subscribed and showing that up every month on your door versus having to lug it from the store. Of course, we are incessant about all-time share highs like Barry was speaking. In the online world also, we have new metrics where we say we aspire to be, in online share, at least equal or higher versus brick-and-mortar. And we have had some fantastic success, as you see here, six out of our new seven power brands have grown in the share in 2023. And these are some all-time high share. Names, ARM & HAMMER, both laundry and litter, THERABREATH, NAIR and SPINBRUSH. It's important to understand. Now these were the results, like the what. Now I will speak a little bit to the how. As Rick was mentioning, a lot of our media spend in the last couple of years has pivoted to digital, right? Simply as the consumer has gotten on to more digital consumption, which is 80% today. But more beautiful than that is, as we have more tactics to measure the efficacy of our media, we are having more and more ROI on every dollar that we put so we get maximum stretch out of our dollar so that we don't just meet the consumer at that moment of truth to get better returns on that dollar spent. So broadly, right, I'm going to speak about the consumer connection in that zero moment of truth, whether the consumer meets us in an out-of-home advertising, on a YouTube video, or an Instagram influencer. But we add to it the incessant and the hallmark of Church & Dwight that is beautiful executional excellence. So I'll share with you some examples of how we execute. These are some digital plus out-of-home advertising. What you will note here is each of them you might have seen in your own feeds. Sorry, back. Each of these you might have seen in your own feeds. What we try to do is we want to make content that is authentic to the platform. So when you see a YouTube advertisement or a Pinterest or a TikTok advertisement, it doesn't feel like an ad creative. It feels like a creative that was meant for that platform. And that's why it generates more thumb-stopping connection with the consumer. Interestingly, I'm sure AI is a buzzword all over the place. One thing that we are noting is, there are some use cases of AI, especially in MarTech, where the creative that you see on the left from our brand NAIR usually, we might have story-boarded and created that over five, six days. With the help of technology and with the right human oversight, these kind of creatives can now be created in under five hours or so. And we try to scale those creatives in what you see on the right, in a very large surround sound mode. So like I was mentioning, we have fit-for-platform, TV creative, social creative, retail media creative as the consumer buys online and search, all of that comes in a surround sound cohesive manner so that your MarTech-enabled creative goes far this right to the point of purchase. Social. Social is what I call as the consumers engage in doomscroll, the endless scrolling. These are some creatives, which are truly, I believe, authentic, thumb-stopping, they are snacky content. We are no longer in the era where we would make a 60-second TV commercial, cut it down to six seconds. We want to. And we do make commercials that are fit from platform six seconds. And like we say, on TikTok, we don't make ads, we make TikToks. So that's the kind of creative we have. All of this creative is amazing. But as we get the consumer from inspiration to purchase, we have to make sure we have one click-to-cut, because we know every time the consumer has to click more times, we lose 90% of that traffic. So from inspiration to purchase, it has to be a single click, and that's what drives a lot of our online revenue. Another interesting pivot we have seen, especially in the last two years, usually, we would do go-to-market and go brick-and-mortar first and go large. We have slightly changed that model, especially for some launches like ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets and Hardball, where we would launch online first, get initial category and consumer insight, all that rich data, all the ratings and reviews Barry was mentioning, do audience testing on the different social platforms. A, we test the product detail page, the content that you see. And once we are satisfied by making it good online, we make it big in brick-and-mortar. That's exactly what we did with Hardball. That's what we are doing with ARM & HAMMER Sheets. We noticed that on sheets, the consumer is looking for not just a sustainability message of good for you and good for the planet. They are looking for the clean that they trust in ARM & HAMMER. And that's what we learned online. And then we take it to brick-and-mortar in a large way. So in summary, in terms of metrics and aspirations, like I said, we are not in the business of getting consumers to shop online, but we are where the consumer is. And online is a lot of growth for us, so we will be very passionate about growing online sales and share growth. To clarify on share, we don't just look at pure-play that is Amazon and Chewy. Online share is measured across Amazon, Chewy, walmart.com, target.com, kroger.com because that's the universe of where eCommerce happens in the country and globally. We are also more, Tech powered and human-guided, related to the MarTech and AdTech investments that we are making. And the next step, the 2.0 and online for us is we are going to be more focused on efficiency and profitability ongoing to make fit-for-channel kind of products that make sense for us in the online world. So I just want to say, in ending, we have come a long way from digital being a capability builder for Church & Dwight, to digital now being a true business and growth driver for the company. So with -- on the topic of growth driver, I'll give it to Mike Read, because International is also a huge growth driver for us. Thank you.
Mike Read: Good afternoon. My name is Mike Read, I lead our International and our SPD business. So, let me just start with the international story. As Rick mentioned earlier, we have upgraded our Evergreen model, so what used to be 6% organic growth, we now moved to 8% organic each year. So, an exciting step for the division. If I break that down a bit, we're about $1 billion in size. There's kind of two parts to it. We have six subsidiary markets that go direct to retail. It's about 63% of our total business, Canada, UK, Mexico, Australia, France, and Germany. The remaining 37% is through our Global Markets Group. So, we operate in about 100 different countries. We partner with 400 value distributor partners around the world. So, our Global Markets business has been our fastest growing over the last few years and will continue to do so. And just to make that kind of point, if you go back to 2009, the international division has tripled in size. And during that time, the Global Markets Group has doubled in importance. So, we see that trend continuing well. While we've had strong growth in our subs, we do expect GMG to continue to outpace that. If I just give a summary of 2023, a very strong year. We had a breakout quarter in Q1, almost 12% growth, followed by 6.1% in Q2, 7.3% in Q3, and we finished strongly with 9.0% in Q4. So, a full year organic of 8.5%. We had strong growth across all our subsidiary markets and double-digit growth across our GMG region as well. So, across the board, really strong results. And that just shows the 6% to 8% Evergreen model change. If you look back over a number of years, other than the sort of setback from last year, we've had pretty consistent growth across a number of years and pitching above 8% in 2023 at 8.5%. I think the good news is relative to our peers, we're still very much underdeveloped. So, we have about 17% of our sales as a company comes from international. We are very much in growth mode. Many of our peers are in the 59% to 60% range, so a long runway ahead. But what's most encouraging about that runway is we've got a portfolio that travels extremely well as do our acquisitions. So, we've got a combination of US power brands like ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, VITAFUSION that travel very well, and that's complemented with a strong personal care and OTC portfolio headlined by BATISTE, STERIMAR and FEMFRESH. So, brands that aren't necessarily commercialized in the US that are playing important roles for the International division. I think most notably though is acquisition has been a really big part of the growth story within International. If you go back to a few years back with the acquisition of WATERPIK, that's one of our biggest brands internationally. And we're thrilled with the addition of THERABREATH and HERO. So, just rolling both those brands out globally, both are on track and actually making a big splash already with lots to come. So, we're really excited about adding those two pieces to the portfolio. If I just sort of summarize sort of three key things to think about from an international perspective, Rick talked about some of the investments that we're making, particularly in our GMG group, but we are putting a lot of infrastructure process, IT to just shore up and be able to support the growth that's coming from our Global Markets Group. We've also added a lot of capabilities around portfolio strategy, revenue growth management, and as Surabhi mentioned, just really upskilling our digital e-commerce capability. And certainly, the acquisition additions and just getting on the front foot on both those acquisitions are the focus areas for international. All right. So, over to Specialty Products. So, the Specialty Products division, we are holding our Evergreen model at 5% growth. If you just break that into kind of two main parts, we have an Animal Nutrition business, which is about two-thirds of the business. You see sort of the impact of MEGALAC. The rest is Specialty Chemicals is about a $320 million business. If you kind of unpack that a little bit, a tough year in 2023, we're down minus 8%. Most of that is MEGALAC-driven. So if you take MEGALAC out, we're actually in positive growth, and the Animal Nutrition business was in stronger growth than that. Most importantly is, we're still very focused on building out our portfolio and supporting prebiotics, probiotics, nutritional supplements across a wide range of species, dairy, cattle, swine, poultry. So nothing really changes. MEGALAC's coming out but the rest of the portfolio is strong. We have high growth ambitions for it. And most notably, we're focused on international similar to the consumer side. So if you go back to kind of 2015, we are less than 6%. We're now at 17%, which is in the parallel of our consumer business, last year, grew 25%. So, really strong growth internationally as well. So with that, I'll pass back to Matt Farrell.
Matt Farrell: People who are long-term shareholders have a pretty good handle on this. You understand the brands and the growth rates and the margins and all that kind of good stuff. But the long-term shareholders have, I think, a better understanding of the importance of the culture in the company. And the culture of Church & Dwight is described in our Annual Report, and it's -- you can read it. It says, we're a blue-collar organization. That doesn't mean -- that's not a dress code thing. This is -- we're just gritty people. A lot of high aptitude people. There's a lot of people that join our company that come from big CPG, and get kind of tired of the big company thing and want to go small and we consider us so small. As we say, we're blue-collar, we're high aptitude and we're underdogs. There's a lot of the people we compete with that are much bigger than we are. But beyond that, for the last five years, we've been getting into predictive analytics. So, we go -- you're sitting in meetings at Church & Dwight, everybody wants to know, what are the facts, get the facts. The next thing is Surabhi described is we becoming digitally savvy. We've embraced that, and it's throughout the company. And one of the things we said in our release and today is that, hey, we're going to be putting more money into this, that we're going to spend more money in e-commerce, both people but also technology. And just to kind of round out what our culture is like, we do embrace diversity. That's a super important and teamwork is super important. And finally, we're risk takers, because as companies get bigger, they often want to pull back and you make decisions in groups and consensus, and that slows things down. And often, you don't make the best decisions. But that's the element you're never going to read about in the sell-side analyst report. You might get it privately, but you're not going to read it in a note. But that's one of the things that you're investing in, and that's one of the things that makes the company go. And if you think about 2022, we pancaked in 2022, right, minus EPS. Hadn't happened in 20 years. But the company is just so creative, clever and resilient that we said, hey, that's -- we're going to turn that around in 2023 and we have. There are a few more things about how we run the place. First, I'll just -- I won't read them all to you, but I'll kind of bomb through. Leverage brands. We've talked about the brands already. Now, a friend of the environment, that's important to us as people and just as human beings, but it's also important to the consumers. So if you talk to younger consumers, they're really interested in the brands that want to be sustainable. So we've embraced that. And if you look at the laundry sheets, that is the most sustainable form of unit dose, comes in a cardboard box, there's no plastic. And it's just a little bit corny, but if you go back to the 19th century, hovering on the left part of this slide, we were putting pictures of birds in baking soda boxes, not baseball players but birds. And the card said, save the birds, save the planet. So this company wasn't environment before anybody could spell sustainability. Then more recently in 2021, we've made a commitment to science-based targets. And in 2023, we started investing in those. So we're putting our money where our mouth is in capital programs. And those capital programs, they're focused on removing, putting less CO2 into the atmosphere. Because up until recently, what we've been investing in is trees to take the CO2 out of the atmosphere, but now we're going to reduce the amount that we actually pump out of our plants. And we get recognized for that. This is lots of rating agencies around the league that rate companies. But you can see we've been recognized BBB and now we're AA for the last couple of years. Number three is the people. So I gave you a little bit of thumbnail with respect to the culture of the company. But we're like super productive, and I think this is a really underappreciated metric. So we generate over $1 million per employee in the company. And generally, you're going to see that with start-ups. And we were very proud of this. And like I said, we're -- if you talk to anybody that's coming up on this stage today, they'll all say we don't have enough people. And we do that deliberately because when you have fewer people, fewer really good people, you prioritize to only work on the stuff that matters. And again, that's part of the culture. We have a really simple compensation structure, familiar net revenue, gross margin, and EPS, cash flow, but also strategic initiatives. We want to make sure that on an annual basis, we're also looking to the future and the types of strategic initiatives we have are with respect to the environment, DE&I, how well we're integrating acquisitions. Also, are we investing in international and also our e-commerce area, so there's five components to the strategic initiatives. And gross margin expansion, you saw we changed our evergreen model. Now, we're saying, we're going to expand faster in the future. And that rains money. And then you can spend that money back on marketing and back on SG&A and again, international and e-commerce. And when that's part of your incentive comp, if you're an employee, you're asking yourself, okay, how can I get it? How can I participate? And here are some of the ways that we run after it. One is Good to Great, which is the name of our continuous improvement program. I always like to joke that, that's the book that everybody has heard about but nobody's read. The next one is supply chain optimization. And this is just investing in our plants, automation, et cetera, new products, you want to launch new products that have a higher gross margin than the gross margin of the products that they're replacing. And then finally, acquisition synergies. When we buy businesses, that's one of the levers we have to improve the businesses that we buy, so our procurement supply chain, et cetera. But also, it's helping our gross margin going forward because of the mix. All right. Number four is leverage assets. This is something else we pay a lot of very close attention to. So it is kind of a pretty slide, and we say 2% of our -- 2% of sales is generally what we think is our sweet spot for investing in CapEx, but we play close attention to the relationship of our cash earnings to our property, plant, equipment and working capital because we believe that every company is a machine. In the machine, you need to invest in assets, both property -- net working capital and the relationship with the cash earnings, so that matters. Okay, and finally, if you do those first four really well, you're going to have a good company, you're going to get good returns. But if you put on top of that good acquisitions, and that is the skill of this company, if you look at all these acquisitions we've done over so many years, almost one per year, we (inaudible) in 2023. We did look at four deals this past year, but we're very fussy about what we're going to buy. So we've gone from $1.5 million to $5.9 million and a lot of that was through acquisitions. And I went through these before. We're very fussy. We stick to these. And with seven big ones today with the opportunity to be even bigger, but more to come in the future. And just to kind of wrap up here, strong organic growth in 2023, strong organic growth in 2024. We're seeing 4% to 5% gross margin expansion again back to back. This new product pipeline is the best in my 17 years with the company. And then international is the future for us. You saw we're only 17% of our sales. Most of our competitors are 40% or higher. That's the future. And then e-commerce of 20% of our sales are ordered online today. We believe by the end of the decade, it will be 30%. So we got to get ready for that. And then finally, we generate lots and lots of cash so we're always on the hunt for new brands. And we're going to bring the whole crowd up here now so we can play the band. All right.
A - Matt Farrell: Steve Powers, you're up.
Steve Powers: Yeah, Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Thank you. Two questions on laundry. The first one is just when we look at track data, market shares have been under some pressure across all formats for Church & Dwight of late. It looks like both sort of at the high-end of PNG and as well as the private label. Maybe just some perspective on what you see going on there, if that's emblematic all channels or just sort of what we see in the track data. And then looking into 2024, specifically with Deep Clean, a little bit more details on the rollout there. Do you expect it to be incremental in terms of phasings for the ARM & HAMMER brand on the shelf, et cetera? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Your first question is probably with respect to the weakness in the fourth quarter with respect to ARM & HAMMER on laundry. If you recall back when we did our Q3 call, by the way, this sounds a little right now. Does that sound okay? If you think back to our Q3 call, we said, hey, we had -- because of revenue growth management, we identified a lot of promotions that we had in Q4 of 2022 that we're not going to repeat in Q4 of 2023. So that cost us. So we lost some share but it was the right thing to do. And if you look at the most recent four weeks ended, say, mid-January, the same is true, like so we cut back as well. So we had a very low deal in the first couple of weeks of January. So it's not unexpected from inside out. Your second question is with respect to Deep Clean. So Deep Clean is that we're entering into the high tier, something going on with this thing. We're entering into mid-tier where historically we've played in value. And yeah, we are going to be getting incremental share in there. And we do think it's going to be contribute to our share growth in 2024. But Barry, if you'd like to add anything?
Barry Bruno: Yeah, sure. Matt, I think you covered it largely, right? So we're going to support the launch of Deep Clean, as you'd expect, as well as fabric sheets. Part of that is going to be part of the share growth story that you're going to see in the months and weeks ahead. And if you look at the last week of track data, share's up in just the last week, if you're bored. 
Matt Farrell: Carlen, do you want to pile on it all? 
Carlen Hooker: [indiscernible]
Matt Farrell: We probably need a mic up here, too, for those in the crowd. Okay, Dara?
Dara Mohsenian: Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. So Matt, if you go back over time, there's a number of examples in the CPG industry of companies raising long-term top line guidance and then sort of disappointing, kind of analogous to the SI coverage inks, you get confident and unexpected things happen. So maybe in that vein, just obviously, numerically, you've answered the division's international higher growth, domestic a bit higher growth numerically. But what gives you the confidence behind raising the evergreen long-term top line growth target at this point? Maybe give us a little bit of detail within those divisions, what's giving you the confidence. And then also, Rick, margins didn't change in the evergreen target. Top line went up, earnings didn't go up. Is that just rounding? Do you have more confidence in the earnings growth and evergreen, but just that specific question would be helpful.
Matt Farrell: Past is prologue. So we had a slide up here that showed if you looked over the last 10 years, so what's been our organic growth rate average? It's been 4%. And almost every year, it's above 4%. And often at these meetings, we get the question, how come it's 3%? So we finally fessed up and said, yeah you know what, going forward it's going to be 4%. I mean, it's as simple as that. Now why would we have confidence there? Because we did change how we're going to get to 4%, right? So we said 3% US, 8% international, 5% Specialty Products. International is going to be a juggernaut for us. It's 8% growth. It's in our one big component is Global Markets Group, and that's been doubling every five years. So we do have such great brands. And what we're doing is what our competitors did 30, 40 years ago, is take your products on the road. So I think a lot of faith in the international number. And just international and US are going to benefit from our two most recent acquisitions, which is THERABREATH and HERO. And we're going to be launching HERO in 40 countries in 2024. And we just got so much runway there. So I got total confidence in our ability to grow the top line 4%. Yeah. I guess you can't rest on your laurels since you did 4% for the last 10 years. But given where I stand today and the innovation that we have, I think it's in the bag.
Mike Read: Yeah. And then in terms of gross margin, really, you're talking about operating margin, right, 50 basis points didn't change from the prior evergreen model to the current evergreen model. Gross margin, we're raising a lot of confidence. We talked about productivity is offsetting moderate inflation, best productivity program that we've ever had. When Rick came in, our sites were too low on productivity. And so we've made a turn, and the ship has turned and so that's a great place to be in. Inflation is moderating, so good confidence there. But we're going to go spend some of that money back on SG&A for those growth investments to cement this higher evergreen model into the future. And so that's why operating margin doesn't change. But it helps give us more degrees of flexibility, which is great.
Matt Farrell: Sure.
Dara Mohsenian: One follow-up there. Sorry. So HERO and THERABREATH, obviously, huge growth. Last year, you mentioned in your answer the acquisition contribution. Can you just give us a sense of your thought process in terms of growth for those two brands in 2024, maybe the distribution opportunity in the US and how big international is as you think about the growth opportunity for those two brands?
Matt Farrell: Okay. Well, I'm going to throw it to Mike to talk about international. I'll let Carlen have a crack at how we're thinking about it in the US.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Why don't we give some good details on what the growth drivers are, we don't get into what percentage growth that we're expecting.
Mike Read: Yes, I can take that first from an international perspective, the -- from a TheraBreath first perspective, I think any time you've got a great success story and a category grower that you take that story internationally, that holds well. And I think we've got a lot of proof points to that within our portfolio. I think what's also encouraging on TheraBreath specifically is we have a very similar type of penetration success in South Korea, where the brand is equally developed. And so being able to take not only a great US story, but being able to take another market internationally and be able to take that story to the trade has been really positive. And Hero, the same thing. It's been such a clear winner for the business. It's a very simple thing to get. Retailers around the world are really excited about it. So both those brands provide scale and fairly easy entry points in the global markets. There's a real demand for it. So we're pretty excited about it.
Carlen Hooker: And then I'll talk to the US. I would say similar story. I mean, retailers are incredibly excited about both Hero and TheraBreath. We've seen tremendous growth in distribution gains this past year. Obviously, based on the results, you saw that there's a lot of runway to go on both of those brands in terms of -- I mean, it's nice to have a brand where retailers are actually calling you asking. So, we really see a tremendous potential for both Hero and TheraBreath across all channels, I would say, agnostic of channels.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And obviously, we know the resets and what the planograms are going to look like.
Carlen Hooker: Yes, we do have information on what we're seeing in terms of the resets and what you'll see are substantial improvements in placement, as well as additional phasings. So, a lot of space coming from both those brands.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Rupesh, you're up and then Chris. Bring your own microphone.
Rupesh Parikh: Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. So just, Rick, question on guidance. Does your guidance incorporate any benefits from share buybacks or debt paydown? And then I have a follow-up question.
Rick Dierker: Yes, good question, Rupesh. We got ahead of our 2024 expectations for buyback. We did $300 million in Q4 of this year. And if cash continues to build on the balance sheet for an extended period of time, we would do a larger buyback at some point. In terms of debt paydown, I think at year-end, we had maybe $200 million on the revolver. We've already paid down another $100 million, so that's kind of embedded in our outlook.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. And then maybe two questions just on innovation. So Matt, you said it's the best lineup, I think, in your 17 years. How do we think about the contribution? Because I think you previously said it's typically a 1 to 1.5 point contribution from new products. And then the Power Sheets, any sense whether you're bringing new customers into the franchise or whether you're sourcing from existing Arm & Hammer users?
Matt Farrell: Yes, we'll take that one first. So I'm going to toss that one to Barry and Surabhi as far as what we're seeing for Amazon.
Barry Bruno: Yes, sure. Our Sheets is still in early days. We're three or four months into launch, but absolutely new users coming in and incremental usage going on. You might use it when you're traveling, you might use it in a vacation home, et cetera. So, still three or four months in, we don't have the full analysis of exactly where, but yes, absolutely new. Would you add anything to that?
Surabhi Pokhriyal: Yes, it's four months in the market, Rupesh. Got around 6,000 reviews and 4.5-star rating. The reviews are super positive. It's a mix of people who want sustainability and care for the planet and do want to do good for people who truly like the clean are coming out of it, because efficacy was really, really important for us, and we didn't want to do just greenwashing. But I think more to come on the analysis of how many are shifting versus new, a lot of them seem to be incremental.
Matt Farrell : Yes. Rupesh, you are accurate that historically, we've said that if you look at our organic growth at 1% to 1.5% is going to come from new products. So our expectation is we're going to exceed 1.5% in 2024.
Rupesh Parikh: Thank you.
Matt Farrell : Get ready, Andrew. You're next after Chris.
Chris Carey: Hey, Chris Carey, Wells Fargo. Just on the guidance and the phasing. So more of a back half weighted guide, totally makes sense with the front half investment. How much of that back half weighted guidance or, if any, depends on success of the innovation? Basically, what's your visibility on the ability to accelerate? And are you anchoring to anything that you're rolling out this year in order to hit that back half number? And then just connected to this, can you maybe give us a sense of what your expectations are for VMS this year? Obviously, some interesting packaging and advertising behind the product going into 2024. Do you expect that business to flatten out? And maybe you could also comment on your expectations for WATERPIK as well?
Matt Farrell : Yes. I'll take a swing at VMS and you guys can prepare for the other pieces. So if we look at the category, categories really struggled this past year. If you look at the first three quarters, it was down in the first quarter, up like a point in the second quarter, down in Q3 and down 4% in Q4. So the category is still recovering from the COVID success where the categories just rocketed. We were down even more in 2023. So we've -- as you heard today, we're making a lot of changes there. We'd be happy with a flat year for our vitamin business in 2024. So that's not -- we're not banking on a big recovery in the VMS business in order to hit our numbers. And okay.
Rick Dierker: Yes, in terms of, I guess, cadence and reliance on new products to kind of hit our outlook on revenue, I would say, we give revenue ranges for a reason. And there's lots of things in play there, whether it's how fast our recent acquisitions grow, how fast our categories grow and competition. We've mixed all that together, and we're very confident in hitting the 4% to 5%.
Chris Carey: And just one quick one as well. Just with the balance sheet going to where it is, your capacity to do deals has accelerated. 2023 is the first time in 20 years you haven't done a deal. Can you just talk about the tension of not doing a deal, cash burning a hole in your pocket, what do you do about it? Would you just rest on that cash and make money because it's a high interest rate environment? I don't know where -- but six months from now, we don't have a deal. Are you starting to get anxious about that? Or just how are you thinking about that in the context of shareholder returns are number five on your TSR accretive M&A priorities. So any context to that.
Matt Farrell : It's only been 12 months though. We did have -- early on, we had a bit of a drought. I think in 2008 we acquired ORAJEL, and 2011 we acquired BATISTE. So I know we had some small deals in there but businesses we don't talk about are very small brands. So as far as decent-sized transactions, we've had seen a drought in the past. And yes, I get the whole -- it's a burn a hole in your pocket, and this is -- or what do you do with the cash? We did a large buyback. I can't remember what year was. It's quite a while ago pre-COVID where we had a lot of cash building up the balance sheet. We hadn't done a sizable deal in a while, and we wound up increasing our authorization to buy back and we bought back more shares. So that's always available to us. But like I said, we looked at four deals this past year and some had pretty good economics but we just didn't think long term that they were going to be able to be sustainable. So no, we don't ever get deal momentum in the company. So we -- like I said, we're really fussy. But we do recognize the fact that we have an unlevered balance sheet. It's pristine. We could be building up a lot of cash if we don't do that. So this time next year, we haven't done a deal. Obviously, we'd be looking a lot harder at buybacks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. The only thing I would add is we're in a great position, like we never chase after a deal just to do a deal. And we say no a lot. We have a lot of rigor around that. This team on the stage spends a lot of their time doing due diligence, and Brian leads that in a big way. So when you have a great performing business, you're never forced to reach for a deal. And so we -- again, just the rigor around that. So we'll let the cash build, as you said. If it builds for a period of time, then we'll look at doing a buyback. Meanwhile, at 5% or 6% interest, it's fine to be in the balance sheet.
Matt Farrell: And you might be encouraged by the fact that we've doubled the size of our M&A team. So for -- so I joined in 2006, and Brian joined in 2006. And in 2023, we added another person. 
Rick Dierker: We're very lean. Matt, you might one-up that. We're tripling it in 2024 with our European footprint. 
Matt Farrell: No, that's true. We're in the hunt to hire somebody in Europe and also in Singapore or in Asia Pacific so we get deal flow outside the US because historically, it's more US-centric, our focus, but it is true. And this is -- by the way, this is the team that goes through the diligence meetings. All the gray beards, old people with better experience. And so Brian is very grateful. Okay. I think that Andrea was going to be next, then Peter. 
Q – Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. So my question, Mike, I have a question on the organic growth into 2024 and then one on follow-up on M&A. First on the organic growth for 2024. I understood you mentioned, Rick, two-thirds coming from volume. So if my math is correct, it's about 3% volume growth for 2024. And with your -- and so kind of like with your cadence of EPS being zero in the first half and the first half is the easiest comp for volume, can you walk us through, number one, point A of that question, getting HERO and THERABREATH and all of those with more ACV? And then having the easy comps for VMS and then the launches of laundry, how we should be thinking of that cadence for organic volume? And then the follow-up on M&A is that like what are the categories that you believe you should better buy growth over greenfield? Thank you. 
Matt Farrell: I'll do the M&A one, so is your question of what categories would be focused on?
Q – Andrea Teixeira : Yes. 
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, I mean, look at the -- you can only buy what's for sale. And we venture into lots of different categories. We will not venture into devices. But we look at household or personal care. Again, it has to be how good is the brand? How good is the brand equity? The economics obviously matter, but what do we bring to the table? Are we a good owner? So we have a pretty wide lens of the types of brands and products that we'll look at. But again, it's got to be a fast-moving consumable. But we don't have -- we don't target. It's one thing we don't want to. So Brian doesn't spend all day long, looking at categories and say, wouldn't it be wonderful to own that brand? Yes, but they're not for sale. So we don't spend any time on those PowerPoints. What we want to make sure is that we're in the deal flow that anything sets for sale, we know about. So we can look at it. That's most important.
Rick Dierker: Yes. In terms of cadence for organic, it's pretty -- our expectation is pretty consistent throughout the year, right? Our outlook is 4% to 5%. Our Q1 number's 4%, but in general, it's pretty consistent throughout the year. There's lots of things underneath that, whether it's comping round two of concentration in laundry and when that happened, whether it's the vitamin category and assumptions and -- so there's a lot of puts and takes. But I'd say in general, it's a pretty consistent growth throughout the year.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Peter, you're next, so let's keep it at that table we have to…
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe just following up on the phasing but more on the gross margin side. So 50 to 75, still above your new evergreen target, but just in the context of exiting the year with 200 basis points-plus, can you maybe just give us a sense for how we should be thinking about gross margin expansion kind of through the year? Is it more front half weighted versus back half? Just any color there. And then last year, you delivered upside, like sales came in better, gross margin came in better, but you chose to reinvest some of that back into marketing. If that were to play out again this year, how should we think about the balance of reinvestment versus dropping more of that to the bottom line?
Rick Dierker: Yes, okay. So the first one is on gross margin cadence. 50 to 75 for the year, we do expect gross margin in the first half to be a little bit better. Why? Because we have pricing carryover that's happening a bit still in the first half of the year that wasn't there. So gross margin a little bit better than the front half than the back half. And then your second question was on -- yes, on marketing investments and stuff like that, okay. Well, look, the scorecard -- last year was kind of unique, right? We wanted to build back the war chest on marketing because we got too low during COVID because we were outside of we were out of stock. We didn't have to supply, all those reasons. And so we did that a year ahead of time. We really initially said, we're going to go to 10.5% and then 11% this year. And we fast-forwarded, put it back to 11%. We think 11% is the right number. But with that said, share matters, share is a scorecard to tell you if you're the right number. Right now, we're getting share in about 60% of our sales. That is a good metric and good scorecard. So right now, we believe that number is the right number.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And the other thing, Peter, I'm sure Barry Bruno put his hand up for spending more marketing money to the extent that we're.
Barry Bruno: I got a lot of new products to support them, so yes.
Matt Farrell: But look, when you got all these new products launched and it's a target-rich environment, there's lots of places we could spend money. We've got the sheets then we just came out with. There is an awareness about that. You got to spend some dough in order to flow that out. But yes, there's lots of opportunity.
Anna Lizzul: Hi, thank you. Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. I was wondering in your evergreen model with the recent revision today, how much is that driven by the success of your more recent acquisitions like HERO and THERABREATH versus the growth of the remainder of the portfolio?
Matt Farrell: Look, everybody is aware of the fact that we've got two fast-growing brands, but this is not just a one-year look. It's because we've grown 4% for 10 years in a row. And the stable of your portfolio can change over time. And obviously, we got two fast-moving ones. We'll have other ones in the future. So we need to see if it's sustainable and clearly sustainable for the next couple of years because of those two.
Rick Dierker: Yes. I would also add that 
Matt Farrell: But it's not a cause effects. Thanks.
Barry Bruno: Yeah.
Rick Dierker: I would also add that in 2023, the rest of the portfolio, ex-THERABREATH, ex-HERO did hit or exceed our evergreen model, so we feel great about the strength of the portfolio.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. that's a good point. So if you think back that 5% growth and 5.3% growth in 2023, more than half of that came from the business ex-THERABREATH and HERO, tell you that the base business is strong. Okay, let's move over to the far table now.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Kaumil Gajrawala, Jefferies. It makes a lot of logical sense why you've narrowed it down to seven focused brands with the most growth. Does that open up the door for divestitures in some of your other categories?
Matt Farrell: I've had that question in the past. And we evaluate all of our brands regularly, because everything is going to pull their weight. But I wouldn't say that signals anything. You see that MEGALAC is one that we've looked at that for a while. It had good years and bad years. But considering that's become commoditized, we think we should move it out. But yeah, it's a regular analysis that we do as a company.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Got it. And the second question on HERO, I think 40 countries that, sounds like a lot. Can you maybe just walk through the process why you feel comfortable there's that much demand in many different places? Do you have a supply? How will you balance the marketing, maybe just going over that a little more?
Matt Farrell: Okay. Let's start with supply. So Rick Spann, take a swing. You think you can supply 40 countries?
Rick Spann: Yeah. So we have a third-party manufacturer...
Matt Farrell: Hang on, Rick.
Rick Spann: Yeah, okay.
Matt Farrell: It's such a good story I want to make sure everybody can hear it.
Rick Spann: We have a third-party manufacturer in South Korea who has a lot of them to grow right now, and they have a lot of property. And they have committed to us that they will put up more buildings and put more lines in place and keep up with our demand. So we have no issues on supply at all. And in fact, if you look at the growth that we've supported last year, we didn't see all of that coming and they were able to respond and meet that very high demand that we had.
Rick Dierker: Maybe, Mike, do you want to comment on the 40 countries, maybe even tell the UK story a little bit.
Matt Farrell: Could we spring for another one up here?
Mike Read: Yeah. What I'd say is just generally across the portfolio, we've had really balanced growth across our five GMG regions and our sub's really healthy. And with doing that, we're able to add more brands to our business with strong appetite from our distributor partners and then on to retail. So HERO is not the only one. We actually have other opportunities to expand multiple brands across multiple countries. But I think just the success story of HERO, not only in the US, but now as we've gone into commercializing into most of our subs already they're already taking number one positions. They have really strong consumption really early. So we've only been in for two, three months and we're already well established as a brand. So the playbook that clearly played out in the US is playing out beautifully already in the markets that we're in. And that just becomes the story that we take to those 40 countries. But we are well poised with our distributor partners around the globe to make a big success globally.
Matt Farrell: Then you can tick off like four or five countries, we've already launched with success?
Mike Read: Yeah. So just in terms of registration getting into markets, so we've launched in Canada, we've launched in the UK, we launched in Germany, France, Australia, all with really strong positions, great retail partnerships doing well online. So everything that we're hoping for, it's that and a little bit more. So it's the success is there. And every time we have that repeatable success in the playbook, it just adds more momentum for those new partners that we're trying to bring on.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay.
Filippo Falorni: Filippo Falorni, Citi. I wanted to ask you about the promotional environment in your categories. You talked about, Matt, stepping back on boundary a bit. What about the other categories? Like do you see any need to step up more promotional activity and what you're seeing from your competitors? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, look, when you talk about the promotional environment, you're generally talking about household. Household is where you have by far the most promotions, couponing, et cetera, et cetera. So, if you look at, say, liquid laundry detergent, unit dose, scent boosters sequentially Q3 to Q4, actually, the deal was declined. Now, went the other way with cat litter. So, cat litter was up 70 basis points sequentially from Q3 to Q4. But if you look at the numbers historically, litter is around 15% sold on deal today. If you went back to 2019 or 2018, it was 20%. So, it's nowhere near where you have historical levels. The same is true for say liquid laundry detergent. It's 33% in Q4. But you'd have to go back again quite a few years. And I think the high watermark was 40% quite a while ago. But then yes, this is quite a while ago so you'd have to say yourself, hey, all suppliers have absorbed these huge cost increases, had to raise price. Is it sensible to think that this is going to be dealt back? So, I think if you look at the trend, you'd say probably not just looking at the trend line. Yes. Okay. Microphone over here?
Javier Escalante: Javier Escalante, Evercore. If you can talk again a little bit the opposite to M&A, the two acquisitions that you made seems to have more extendability into adjacencies. WATERPIK doesn't come across that way, but HERO, THERABREATH, there seem to be adjacencies. Have you -- when you talk about that, whether that inform also the 4% that probably is 5%, if the new target internally, if you can talk about that?
Matt Farrell: Yes. What was the last part of that, the 4% is actually--
Javier Escalante: You mentioned that you first hoped that you thought it was 4% and you were promising 3%. Perhaps now you think that is 5% and you're promising 4%.
Rick Dierker: That's one way to think about it, but no -- we wouldn't really comment on what our internal expectations are. But why don't we answer how extendable is HERO and THERABREATH and other?
Matt Farrell: Yes, I'll start off and then Barry, you pile on. So, we want a business that disrupted a category. So, the category was a $500 million category in the US say, four or five years ago. And then this new form comes along. Now, it's a billion-dollar category and still growing. So, we said, hey, what you really want to do is you don't want to get distracted. You want to really do a great job with household penetration of patches in the United States and also taking it globally. So, that's where our focus is. But there are opportunities to go elsewhere.
Barry Bruno: Yes, for sure. Both of them are extendable, there's no question about it, right? Oral care and skin care, two giant categories, depending on how you define them. Both brands are so strong that they're absolutely expendable. It's a balancing act of doing the right job at the right time and not getting over your skis too fast. So, I would say it's not a question of if, it's when. And we've got an absolute plan about adjacencies to move into for each brand. They're super strong brands. Consumers are asking for more and more from us. It's tempting to go faster. We just want to support them in the right way, especially they're foundation products.
Matt Farrell: I'll be getting e-mails from people in marketing and new products tomorrow, because you're on their team. We should be going into adjacent categories more quickly. But I think the slow roll is going to pay off long-term. Okay. I think that might be it. Anybody else that has…?
Rick Dierker: Olivia has been waiting.
Matt Farrell: Oh Olivia, so sorry, dead center.
Olivia Tong: Thank you. I just wanted to ask you Rick about the SG&A target coming in a little bit. And if you could give a little bit more color behind that. Does it reflect incremental investment in certain areas in terms of operations? Or is it more a function of lower leverage, even though the organic sales target is going up? And then, just on the sort of narrowing and consolidation of power brands, what is that -- does that suggest anything in terms of the ones that aren't part of the seven? I imagine that they will change in terms of resourcing. It's just a function of how you're going in, but just wanted to make sure that I clarify that. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So, the second one first. We've been managing the business with classifying our brands in a certain way for a very long time, and we resource those brands in a certain way, depending on the classification. And that is not changing, right? That's our internal. This is to help simplify when we talk outside what those brands represent and narrow the conversation, because those are what are driving kind of whether the top line moves or margin expands or earnings. So that's kind of the purpose. Your first question on SG&A, I think you're talking about the outlook, really, the evergreen model. Yes. Yes, dollars are higher, in general. We're getting leverage for two reasons. Really primarily because of we're growing faster than the top line is what we're doing. We're also spending money, as we've been talking about for a long time, on investments in analytics, automation. We're trying to take hundreds of thousands of hours out over the next three to five years. And we're not going to reduce people. We're going to not add people when we scale, right? We're making these system investments and ERP systems, not so that we can have a workforce that's reduced, because as we grow from $6 billion to $7 billion to $8 billion, the ERP system can handle that type of growth. So that's a short answer.
Matt Farrell: Okay. I think we're good. Hey, thanks, everybody, for joining us.
A - Rick Dierker: Thank you.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Church & Dwight’s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Matt Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us today. I’ll begin with a review of Q3 results, and then I’ll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is wrapped up, we’ll open the call up for questions. So let's begin. Q3 is the fourth consecutive quarter of solid results beginning with Q4 2022. Reported revenue was up 10.5%, which exceeded our 8% outlook. Organic revenue grew 4.8%, also exceeding our 4% outlook. It's worthy of note that our global consumer business posted 5.8% organic growth, which exceeded our expectations. Going the other way, our SBD business accounted for one point of negative growth. Our gross margin expanded 270 basis points, and marketing as a percentage of sales increased 80 basis points to 11.5% of sales. Adjusted EPS was $0.74, which is $0.8 higher than our $0.66 EPS outlook, and that result was driven by higher than expected sales growth and gross margin expansion. It's important to call out the 2.7% positive volume growth in Q3. It's the first in eight quarters, and our expectation is that positive volume growth will continue in Q4 to finish out the year. We continue to grow in the online class of trade. 17% of our global sales were purchased online in Q3, compared to 16% in the year ago quarter. Just a few comments on the economy. Unemployment remains low in the U.S., and in most of our major international markets. Unemployment is the stat that we closely watch. Regarding the health of the consumer, household balance sheets are more stretched as savings are lower, and credit card debt is higher. Student loan payments are restarting. Mortgages and auto loans are more costly, why? Because of higher interest rates, and higher oil may lead to higher gasoline prices. So a higher cost environment leads to trade down. As consumers look for the best value, especially in our household categories, and we are well positioned for this trade down, given that 40% of our portfolio is value products. Now I'm going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business posted strong 5.5% organic sales growth, of which 3.6% was volume driven. Seven of our 14 power brands held or gained a market share in the quarter, and for context, the brands that grew share represent 65% of our U.S. sales. Private label is another stat that we closely watch. The good news here is the weighted average private label market share in our categories is stable. Now I want to look at a few of the more important categories in the U.S., starting with laundry. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry continues to see consumption growth driven, in part, by the continued trade down to value brands and by media support behind our new Give It The Hammer advertising campaign which celebrates the great value that ARM & HAMMER offers in tough economic times. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent held share in the quarter as a category grew 5%. We're now at 14.3% share and XTRA, our extreme value offering, grew consumption 6.1% and increased market share to 3.8%. Regarding new products, we launched a new unit dose form of detergent, ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets laundry detergent as the first laundry detergent sheet from a major brand in the US, Power Sheets is a convenient new unit dose form of detergent that delivers an entirely new laundry experience. It is mess free, it's lightweight, and eliminates plastic bottle waste. While delivering the trusted ARM & HAMMER powerful cleaning performance that consumers have come to rely on and love. We launched the product online in August. In September, Power Sheets was the number one laundry detergent item during Amazon's September Prime Day event. So we're off to a great start with this innovation which will roll out even more broadly in 2024. Now Litter, ARM & HAMMER Litter also continues to perform extremely well with 11% growth outpacing the category which was up 8% and growing share to almost 25%. Consumers continue to choose ARM & HAMMER™ Litter offerings. We have steady demand for our premium litter offering which is a black box, but our orange box in particular is driving the growth as it offers a great value for the cost constrained cat owner. Our new ARM & HAMMER Hardball lightweight clumping litter is off to a solid start as distribution expands in the lightweight segment where we are underrepresented today. Turning it out of personal care, our BATISTE grew consumption 14% in the quarter as we continue to build dry shampoo awareness and drive household penetration. The dry shampoo category and BATISTE have room to run as we continue to invest to build awareness in dry trial, especially through sampling. HERO which was acquired last October, captured the number one market share position in the total acne treatment category. In the acne patch subcategory, MIGHTY PATCH is over 50% share. Retail distribution continues to grow and we still have room to run as we expand across all classes of trade. The HERO team is doing a spectacular job growing this business. There continues to be a great deal of buzz here at Church & Dwight around the HERO brand and its future growth potential. Similarly, THERABREATH, which was acquired in 2021, is performing extremely well and has been gaining share at a rapid pace. In Q3, THERABREATH took over the number one share position in the non-alcohol segment with almost a 29% share. Distribution of THERABREATH has more than doubled since the acquisition date, and we expect this brand to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight. Regarding a couple of businesses that depressed our results last year, WATERPIK continues to stabilize with Q3 coming in close to plan similar to Q2. WATERPIK all channel consumption, actually was up slightly in Q3. Turning to gummy vitamins, while the VITAFUSION was close to our expectations in the first half, our consumption was down 11% in Q3, partly due to distribution losses at many retailers due to our supply issues in 2022. And our job now is to win back retailer confidence and then regain lapsed consumers. Next up is International. Our International team is doing a great job delivering organic sales growth of 7.3% in Q3, driven by broad-based growth in most of our subsidiaries and our global markets group. Volume contributed 2.3% of the growth, and this was led by STERIMAR in Nasal Hygiene, and OXICLEAN. Both STERIMAR and HERO are gaining distribution across our international markets, and we expect more to follow. And finally, especially products. Organic sales decreased 10%. But this is largely due to one product line called MEGALAC, which is being hurt by inexpensive imports. Excluding MEGALAC, the remainder of SPD delivered positive growth of 2%. I'm going to wrap up by saying we just closed out a strong October, and we expect positive volume growth for a second consecutive quarter in Q4. We raised our reported sales outlook to reflect the strength of consumer demand for our products while maintaining our full year EPS outlook. Now when we are performing well going into the fourth quarter, it's an opportunity to invest in the business. This is a long-standing practice of reinvestment at Church & Dwight and is well understood by long-term shareholders. We take a long view with respect to the health of the business. Our business model is working. Our value offerings are performing well as are our premium offerings. Innovative new products are contributing to our growth and we have one of our best new product lineups coming in 2024. Acquisitions are on track and significant cash generation positions us to continue to add TSR-accretive brands to our portfolio. And now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some color around Q3 and the full year and the investments we'll be making at Q4.
Rick Dierker : All right, thank you Matt. And good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was at $0.74 down 2.6% to the prior year. As Matt mentioned the $0.74 was better than our $0.56 outlook primarily due to higher than expected sales growth and gross margin expansion. Net sales were up 10.5% and organic sales were up 4.8%. Over half of our organic growth in the quarter was driven by volume. The total consumer business was up 5.8% organically. Our third quarter gross margin was 44.4%, a 270 basis point increase from year ago primarily due to improved pricing, volume, productivity and the impact of the HERO acquisition net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs. Let me walk you through the Q3 bridge. Gross margin was made up the following. Positive 140 basis points impact from price volume mix. Positive 120 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 160 basis point impact from productivity, partially offset by a drag of 150 basis points due to inflation. Moving to marketing. Marketing was $27 million up year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of sales was 11.5% or 80 basis points higher than Q3 of last year. For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A increased 310 basis points year-to-year, primarily due to higher incentive comp, improved business performance, SG&A related to the HERO acquisition, and investment spending. Other expense, all-in, was $21.8 million, a $2.4 million increase due to higher average interest rates. For the full year, we now expect other expense of approximately $95 million. For income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.1%, compared to 20.2% in 2022, an increase of 390 basis points as the prior year rate included the benefit of a non-recurring state tax reduction. We continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 22%. And now to cash. For the first nine months of 2023, cash from operating activities was $795 million, an increase of $261 million due to higher cash earnings, including the positive impact from recent acquisitions, and improvements in working capital. Turning to the full year outlook, We now expect the full year 2023 reported sales growth to be approximately 9%, up from our previous outlook of 8%. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be approximately 5%. We now expect full year reported gross margin to expand 210 basis points up from 200 basis points. This is an encouraging trend as we continue to move closer to restoring gross margins to pre-COVID levels. We continue to expect a double digit percentage increase in gross profit in full year 2023. Looking at inflation, we continue to expect around $120 million of higher manufacturing costs in 2023. This is well below what we have experienced in the last couple of years. While many commodity prices remain below prior year levels, resins and oil based commodities are a bit higher. We continue to expect full year marketing as a percent of sales to be 11%. And we continue to expect full year SG&A to be higher in both dollars and as a percent of sales compared to 2022. SG&A is expected to be higher than our previous outlook driven by incremental R&D investments, higher incentive compensation given our strong performance and a bad debt reserve related to one specific customer situation. As in past years when we have strong business performance, we invest for the future. Our investments will focus on driving future growth with higher marketing dollar investment, R&D investment, including clinical studies and accelerating product registrations in international markets, as well as driving efficiency, including investments in automation and technology. We continue to expect full year adjusted EPS growth to be approximately 6%. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the step up of marketing that we've been talking about and higher SG&A. We continue to expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $1 billion. Our full year CapEx plan is now expected to be approximately $230 million as we continue to make capacity investments. And we expect to return to historical levels of CapEx about 2% of sales by 2025. Moving on to Q4, we have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of 5% and approximately 4% for organic with volume contributing 1% or better. Organic growth rate in Q4 reflects positives from HERO, Litter and THERABREATH and negatives from not repeating some low margin laundry promotions. We expect gross margin expansion, a significant increase year-to-year in both marketing and SG&A, and marketing is expected to be an excess of 14% in Q4. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.53 per share, a 2% increase from last year. So to summarize a strong nine months of the year behind us, we saw the inflection point of volume growth as expected and we are spending on marketing and investments to build momentum for 2024 and beyond. With that Matt and I would be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So just starting with the specialty product segment, how do you think about the business in the coming quarters? So this quarter obviously a larger decline. Just wanted to get a sense of we should see weakness for a few more quarters until you lock the issue that you cited.
Matt Farrell: Yes. It's going to be a, Rupesh, it's going to be a drag again in Q4. So when Rick calls a 4% number for organic for Q4 that's a net of SBD which kind of reduces the contribution from the consumer business. But so yes at least one more quarter where we're going to be down maybe in Q1 as well.
Rick Dierker : Yes, I think the nuance, Rupesh, also is when you look at like a 4% growth rate in Q4. When we talk about investing many times we talk about SG&A or marketing, sometimes we're doing really well. We also look at customer profitability. We take -- we get ahead of it and call unprofitable or low profit promotions in some of our businesses like laundry.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. That's a good segue to our next question. So organic sales growth was maintained for the full year. So it sounds like those lower margin laundry promotions is what may have limited that organic sales growth increase for the full year. Is that correct or is there anything else weighing on? A lot of organic --
Matt Farrell: No, that's true. Last year in the fourth quarter we had a looking back now, we had a lot of promotions that we thought were not profitable. So we called them. So they're not going to be in place for this fourth quarter, which obviously results in a lower volume.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. Maybe just a follow-up. Just relate to that. Is there a way to quantify the impact of the lack of running those promotions?
Matt Farrell: The user to do that when the quarter is over than do right now. Now it's more conjecture, but it is a direct.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about kind of where we are for both HERO and THERABREATH in terms of as we're moving into next year trying to understand the distribution? Is it where you expect to be or we have tougher comps for both of those businesses in terms of growth in year two?
Matt Farrell: Remember, in year one, we'll say it's 2023, when we were gaining distribution was throughout the year. So we'll have full year benefit. All the distribution gains in 2024 versus ‘23. So that's a positive. So naturally, the comps are more difficult once you've got it in place. But the demand for the product is surprising us. In fact, the demand has been exceptional wherever we've launched it. The second thing is we'll be launching HERO in dozens of countries next year through our global markets group. And that will happen throughout the year so that's not a Jan one thing, but see a lot of opportunity there as well. Now THERABREATH, THERABREATH was acquired in December of 2021. And they have far more distribution already than HERO did when we acquired THERABREATH. We did expand that in 2022, but I'd say 2023 versus 2022 is less benefit from distribution gains in comparison to HERO. What's happening is because the demand for THERABREATH and the consumers voting in favor of THERABREATH, what's happening is retailers are willing to give us more shelf space. And we fully expect to get more shelf space when the resets happen in 2024.
Rick Dierker : Yes, Bill, that's the big difference for 2024. In 2023, we got TDPs. We got new retailers, new stores. Now it's all about shelf space and expanding that footprint. And that's what's happening.
Bill Chappell: Got it. And then, second, just kind of trying to understand the spend or the accelerated spin in 4Q to kind of keep your EPS guidance in check. Is that more SG&A because it does sound like you'll have some year-to-year benefit on gross margin by just pulling back on some of the promotions. Or is there a, will it be SG&A and gross profit in terms of kind of how you're trying to reinvest in business to keep things going in ‘24?
Rick Dierker : Yes, Bill, it's mostly SG&A. It's, some of it’s higher incentive comp, but many of it is the investments we've talked about these last few quarters and just more of that. I think HERO is a good example. As we fast forward product registrations, we're going to be in 40, 50 new countries pretty rapidly because we're able to do that. So we think all these investments are great and they're going to help us in 2024 and beyond.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Carey at Wells Fargo Securities.
Chris Carey: Hey guys, one quick follow up on laundry and then broader question. The promotions that you're talking about, have that been occurring over the course of the year or was that something new that you did because you're responding to the environment or you saw an opportunity because you're tracking ahead? I'm trying to understand if we're slopping something or this is a new decision. Apologies, you should understand but --.
Matt Farrell: These are promotions that happened in Q4 ‘22 that didn't happen in Q3 or Q2 ‘22. So there was isolated to Q4 last year and the decision to pull back on those is because we can. And besides like I said earlier, there weren't the best payback. So we said it's a good time not to repeat them.
Chris Carey: Okay, that makes sense. I know we'll get guidance on 2024, next quarter, but you have given kind of high level thoughts. As they think about this, volumes positive, you still have gross margin, momentum behind productivity, inflation is easing. I think you've kind of taken a view on that and you've rebased investment spending this year. Is there anything that we should be just thinking about, perhaps less obvious, going into next year, and just maybe any kind of like high level thoughts about how you feel about the business and your momentum going to 2024? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Well, Chris, we feel great about the business. You see the kind of numbers we just posted in Q3 and the gigantic number, 5.8% organic growth for the consumer business. And then when thinking about Q4, we got another 4% organic growth and that's got a drag from SBD as well. And we expect a second consecutive quarter of volume growth. So we hope to start stringing these together. We're going to have volume growth a quarter, each quarter for the next four or five quarters. Gross margin, you're right. As Rick said, if we hit the number that's in the box right now, we'll be 150 basis points short of our high watermark for gross margin, which was 45.5 back in 2019. So we would expect to get more of that back next year. Not all of it, of course, but we expect gross margin expansion. And one of the good things about this year is we came all the way back with marketing as percentage of sales. Last year at 10%, we started the year seeing, hey, let's try to get to 10.5% and then we're all the way to 11%. So that's behind us now. So then I say, the other thing I said was we have one of our best new product pipelines coming in 2024 and it's pretty broad based. So now we got this, a lot of things we feel really great about. And so we're very confident in the strength of the business.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank
Steve Powers: Great. Good morning. Thank you. A question first is on the fourth quarter guidance. There are two questions actually. The first one, maybe my numbers are off, but it feels like you kind of need to do $0.64 or even $0.65 in the fourth quarter to get to $3.15 based on what you've done the first nine months. Just want to see if I'm missing something in that math. And then as we're talking about that just the gross margin, because it implies about a couple hundred basis points of gross margin expansion. I don't know. Which you're able to kind of preview how you think the bridge between price volume and productivity and inflation will kind of battle out in that [inaudible].
Matt Farrell: Yes, no problem on the first one, Steve, but if you could repeat the second one, it would be helpful, you are breaking up.
Steve Powers: Sorry, I think it's about 200 basis points of gross margin expansion implied in the fourth quarter. Just how you think that's going to kind of shake out between the benefits of price and volume versus and productivity offset by the by the lingering inflation.
Matt Farrell: Yes, got it. Okay. Well, the first one is on EPS. We've, if you take a big step back, we've looked at we typically repurchase shares on annual basis to offset share creep. We didn't do that this year. We may get ahead of that in 2023 for 2024. So that in rounding will probably get you most of the way to the difference on your EPS for Q4. The second thing on your gross margin bridge questions, I would say, of course, the price component of -- the price volume mix component, the gross margin bridge comes down a little bit more in Q4. The price piece, but the volume and mix piece are going to go up because we used to have acquisition by itself, which was HERO and that gets blended into kind of the mix of the portfolio. So I would probably say in Q4, a big tailwind from price volume mix, a little bit lower productivity just because it's timing and those projects are choppy. And then, of course, we go backwards a little bit on manufacturing costs and inflation year-over-year. So those are kind of the three pieces to the main three pieces for the gross margin bridge.
Steve Powers: Okay, that's perfect. And if I could just, I guess this is more, this is nine ‘24 question, one of sort philosophical question. So, if we go back to 2021 and coming into ‘22, the original expectation was that everything was on the table. It didn't play out that way, obviously, but if you think about that, if we had grown evergreen in ‘22 and ‘23, we'd be looking at $3.50 there about of earnings in ‘23, not 3.15. So I guess the question is as we look forward is, are you guys approaching the future trying to claw back that $0.35 over time or have we sort of written off ‘22 and we're kind of philosophically running evergreen from here.
Matt Farrell: Well, Steve, I mean, everybody, any public company that is with a question like that is going to say, hey, 2022 was and it was the last year of a three year COVID event. In 2023, there were three things that hit us. It was a WATERPIK and vitamins post COVID and then Flawless. And so the business and gets to re-baseline. WATERPIK, vitamins and Flawless in 2023 and then we kind of grow from there. So I think that's the simplest way to think about it. The three isolated incidents that affected us in 2022. We've got our eyes open about that. Those businesses, vitamin is certainly stabilized. Pardon me, WATERPIK is stabilized, vitamins is still declining, but we have a path back to stabilize that business next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. So can you give us a little bit more of an update on the vital VITAFUSION business? You obviously mentioned the weak retail sales. We can see in the scanner data with the distribution losses. Do you have visibility that can snap back going forward in 2024 that you can in fact regain shelf space based on your plans and perhaps that business can return to growth at some point. And maybe just in general, help us understand your plans on that business for 2024.
Matt Farrell: Yes, well, it's kind of a simple problem. We weren't able to supply in 2022. So we got punished by retailers in 2023 losing shelf space, little interest in making new product launches et cetera. And so consequently, you lose shelf space, you're going to lose consumers. And so now the whole game is this win in the resets in 2024, which now is, do we have a lot of visibility to that? We have some right now. We'll have more. And we thought they're everybody in January, but the fight is really to win back more shelf space in 2024. That's some good news with respect to vitamins. We are the number one gummy vitamin on Amazon. And we have been doing extremely well there this past year. So that's going to be a bigger focus for us going forward as well. But we do think it's just execution and blocking and tackling, Steve, to get that business on firm footing.
Rick Dierker : And meanwhile, we're investing in a big way on marketing to drive awareness, new packaging to pop at shelf. And displays, all those tactical things that you can do as the momentum will build back.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay, great. And then you touched on that you think you're well positioned for consumer trade down. Are you actually seeing that? And then maybe also, can you just give us a sense of the promotional environment you're seeing? Obviously, you touched on the laundry issue specifically, but just in general, the promotional environment.
Matt Farrell: Yes, look, the trade down, as I mentioned in my opening remarks in the litter class of trade, or litter category, we have a black box and an orange box and a black box is premium. The orange box is value. And so consumers are staying within the franchise trading down from black box to orange box. And it shows in our shares. So our shares are almost like 25% in litter. Your other question was more broadly with respect. Let me comment on laundry as well. I mean, laundry has, we've been doing trade down since beginning, I guess the middle of 2022, quarter after quarter. And this past quarter, liquid laundry grew with the category, but extra you see has started to grow. And that again is a sign of the times. It's a deep value laundry detergent. So once again, I think our portfolio was well positioned for a difficult economic environment. Of course, as long as unemployment stays low, people have jobs. We think that it's going to, people are going to be discerning when they go shopping, but they have money in their pockets to shop. So I think the best value is going to win. When it comes to the promotional environment, liquid laundry, just to give you some numbers, round numbers, if you look at liquid laundry sold on deal in Q1, it was around 32%. And Q2 is like 33.5% and Q3 was 35%. So liquid laundry has been creeping up during 2023. So it's around where you expect it to be pre-COVID. So it's kind of all the way back. Same is true for unit dose. You look at unit dose sequentially Q2, Q3, 31% sold on a deal on Q2, 36% in Q3. Now litter is a different story. I think it's largely because of the difficulties that one of the competitors has had and has consequently pulled back on promotion. So the trend for litter Q1, Q2, Q3 is like a 15% in Q1, 14 .5% in Q2 and like 14.2% in Q3. So that kind of gives you a sense for the trend. I'd say in vitamins, it sequentially is up 200 basis points from Q2 to Q3. There are some competitors that are spending 55% sold on deal. It can't make a lot of money that way, but it definitely does grab volume. But I think those four categories, liquid laundry. unit dose, litter, vitamins give you a sense for what's going on in the promotional environment, Steve.
Operator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I have a question about HERO. Hey, so in the past, I think you've talked about being focused on sort of acne related categories with HERO. But we've seen some press talks about you expanding into retinol and eye cream and balms and stuff. So just curious kind of where you stand on beauty overall. And just perspective there and start there.
Matt Farrell: Well, look, our number one objective is to win in acne and there's some acne patches and also related products to acne. And that's pretty broad. This is a really, really big category. And the opportunity for us to plan on launching in dozens of countries in 2024 with HERO. So we think this is just so much runway. And there still needs to be greater awareness of the patch form, which is another reason why we want to make sure we don't get too much of our focus outside the patch category. Now, HERO is a fabulous brand. It resonates with consumers of all ages. We definitely do have the right and the permission to go to categories that are adjacent to acne. And yes, that could be in our future. But in the near term, the focus is on patches.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. And then just sticking with HERO and maybe my math is wrong, but just with it moving into organic, I guess in mid-October, it looks like it should add two to three points to organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. So I just wanted to make sure that was sort of roughly the right order of magnitude for thinking about this, and then just ask about sort of what that implies for everything else kind of decelerating sequentially. Frankly, is it conservatism or is there something you're seeing that would support that modeling that deceleration? Thanks.
Rick Dierker : Hey, Lauren. It’s Rick, I would say our math does not lead to two to three points of organic contribution from HERO. Remember, there was sell-in to new retail distribution in Q4 last year for HERO. So from a comp perspective, it just doesn't that much that you're calculating. I think overall, we think consumption is still really strong in Q4. And October was off to a great start. I think Matt mentioned it was one of our highest shipment months ever in the history of the company. So we feel really good about our momentum right now. And we've made some choices to discontinue some promotions and I think that's what kind of the nuance is for folks that they weren't expecting.
Matt Farrell: Yes, and Lauren, it all depends on your perspective. Look, people, it depends on the narrative. Do you want to look at sequential Q3 to Q4? Do you want to look at just year-over-year and look at comps and say, what was in last year versus this year? But we have total confidence in where we sit right now with respect to the demand for the products as evidenced by such a strong October. So yes, we think we've got a good number for Q4. And yes, sometimes people accuse us of being conservative. But one thing is for sure about Church & Dwight is we take the long view. We don't have short-term thinking. And I think that anybody listening to the call and certainly our long-term shareholders understand that we're always palms up and try to make sure people, create understanding for not just you the analysts, but for our shareholders. And we're really confident not only Q4, but in our future.
Operator: The next question comes from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America.
Anna Lizzul: Hi, good morning and thanks so much for the question. I wanted to ask on the higher marketing and investment spend; I think some of us were expecting you could potentially see a benefit in market share in certain categories like litter from a competitor's disruption. And maybe that would provide some leverage on the investment side. So I was wondering if you could talk more about where you are investing in terms of marketing spend. and where you think you need the most support among your categories. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, you may be referring to litter. We threw some help from litter sales wise in Q3 and some of that will continue in Q4, but there's lots of opportunities to invest when it comes to marketing. There's not just the advertising. Remember, we had some new products we just launched like the laundry sheets, but sampling is another avenue for us. We've had remarkable conversion rates on sampling of, say, THERABREATH. We think also it can be true for laundry sheets. There's non-working media as well that we can get after in Q4 to prepare for 2024. Over in R&D, there's clinical trials that we can start earlier than expected for one product in particular that we're looking at. It's just a whole list of things that we can go after. Generally, we're always going to be supporting the businesses that need the help, so that would be vitamins, for example. But then you want to feed the strong as well. And we've got a lot of businesses that are on fire right now. So we'll just pour it on in Q4.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to go back to the 4% organic guide for, the fourth quarter, I take another swing on that one. You said the 50-50 volume, Rick, would be even higher now in the fourth quarter. So it does imply a really much bigger step down in pricing. And I understand that with the discontinuing of some of the non-profitable promo that you had, that would imply that obviously you had pricing realization higher. So I was trying to see what is implied in your guide. And then related to that also in terms of pricing. And then related to that also, how long do you think it's going to take? Because it seems as if you're starting to lap those promos and reducing those promos at the trade, how long do you think this is going to linger for another three quarters into 2024?
Rick Dierker : Okay. Hey, Andrea. So I guess first of all, in my prepared comments I said we thought Q4 would be 1% or better on volume. So not half. And in Q3 it was better than half. But in Q4 we think it's 1% or better. And part of that is because of some of the promotional pullback and discontinuing of promotions like I talked about. We don't think that's continues at all into 2024. Those are some discrete promotions we chose to not repeat in Q4. That's the simple story.
Andrea Teixeira: And then any other, one of the things if we step back then strategically, if you have always told us, right, you have 40% of your portfolio in value, which implies obviously the other 60%, somewhere between mid-year to above. And of course the consumer is moving down. Is that like what we've been seeing now is that probably now we're starting to feel it, right? It's like it's a race to the bottom in the sense that we'd rather not to have consumers trade down in general to you as well, because it's like at the end of the day, you want to create growth and you want to work with your retailers to create growth in the category for innovation. So I was wondering if you can kind of like go back to both laundry and litter because you have on those categories you go across and it's great, but in some ways, you also want to stop that movement in the sense that otherwise it's going to lower the total value of the category. So can you comment a little bit more on those two specifics as well as the other one which is the vitamin situation that I thought that at this point you would have lapped a lot of that impact and that retailers would give you back some shelf resets. And if you can comment on that for shelf resets into spring for vitamins next year.
Rick Dierker : Okay, so I would take that in two parts and I'll start with the second one. On vitamins, we kind of just talked about that recently over the last quarter or two. It's going to take a full 12 months to get back into the shelf position that we want to and all those tactics we talked through is what's going to enable us to do it. So I know it feels like it's been a long time but we've only been talking about that relatively for a short period of time. Your second question on trade down, I think Matt and I have been really clear over a long period of time the company does really well, our brand portfolio does really well in good times and in bad times and the value brands of course do better but even what you would call our mid-tier premium, it depends what category you're in. Most of our premium brands like THERABREATH or HERO are doing astonishingly, just fantastic. Yes, we do have some rise of private label in a couple categories but in general consumption is strong for the quarter end for October.
Matt Farrell: And Andrea, we feel great about having this sort of portfolio that gives consumers a choice and can trade down. The thing you've got to keep in mind too is if you look back at ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry, it has grown share just about every year that I've been here. Year after year in good times and bad times. So it's not simply, yes, it gets accelerated when you have an economic downturn but what happens is people trade down, they discover the brand and they stick with it. That's true for ARM & HAMMER Laundry now. If you go over to Litter, trade down between black box and orange box is great keeping consumer in the category and certainly when the economy recovers people trade back up to the black box.
Rick Dierker : And just one comment for everybody as we move forward because we're starting to get a little tight on time. Let's just try to keep it to one question and maybe one follow-up question.
Operator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James.
Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. First on marketing, can you just talk about what is incremental in Q4 versus your prior expectations, what's driving the 14% particularly if there's a big change in certain categories and then your flexibility around that? Because if I remember correctly, Q3 and Q4.
Rick Dierker : We always thought it was we weighted more towards Q4. We did have some marketing shift out of Q3 and Q4 largely because of MPD support. Like even our laundry sheets, we sold out so fast that we wanted to make sure that the marketing was turned on and we had the supply. So we shifted some of that into Q4.
Olivia Tong : Got it. And then just laundry. Can you talk about the shape of your laundry portfolio because your first market with the sheets, which is obviously a premium price product. But then we're cutting back on some promo, but also sounds like you're benefiting from trade down. So how are you thinking about the positioning of your laundry portfolio premium versus mid-year versus sort of the opening price point with XTRA? How do you think about that longer term and then also just in the midterm as you embark on this next new category?
Matt Farrell: Well, if you look at the value detergent, there's this value and there's extreme value. So you're right. XTRA is the extreme value. And ARM & HAMMER is the high end of value, maybe even the low end of mid-tier. And that has been a strategy for a long time. Pods is an area where we're underrepresented and we only have a 4% share of pods. When in fact, in liquid laundry, we have a 15% share. Now, pod is unit dose, but since so is sheets. And sheets have an advantage in that it's more sustainable, no more plastic jugs. So we do think that that's going to help us gain even greater share in unit dose. Yes, I could cannibalize some ARM & HAMMER pods, but we do think it's going to be attractive to anybody who's using pods today because we don't have the plastic pouches. This comes in a carton and people who don't want to be carrying the big jugs anymore will migrate to sheets as well. So we think there's a lot of positives by adding sheets to the portfolio.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Grom at UBS.
Peter Grom: Thanks operator and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask specifically about gross margins. You made a lot of progress this year and, Matt, you kind of mentioned that you saw this opportunity to kind of get back to this 45.5% target, but you also said, I think, in your response to Chris' question that you wouldn't get it all back next year. So can you maybe help us unpack the reasons why that might be the issues given the momentum you're angling the year with. And then just maybe building on that, Rick, last year, you kind of mentioned that you were less hedge heading into the year than previously. Can you maybe just give it a comment or so on your outlook for inflation and whether or not you're kind of deploying a similar hedging strategy looking ahead. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, I know this is a lot to do with our forward looking guidance for 2024. So I would just tell you, we'll get into all those details in January, February. We do think we have now gross margin expansion. We think there's tailwinds on gross margin because for the first time in a long time, productivity can outpace inflation. Inflation, we think still higher than normal next year, but not anywhere near what it's been like these past few years. So that's kind of what I would tell you in a heartbeat. The other nuances really, when we look ahead, our pre-COVID margin should be higher because we have some better, faster growing personal care products like HERO and THERABREATH. So we fully recognize that as well, but it's going to be, like I said, the Deutsche Bank Conference and Barclays Conference as well. It's going to be two to three years to get to get there. And so we're going to take a good step each and every year.
Operator: Next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Guys, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the M&A environment as kind of the situation continues to evolve? Are you seeing any potential assets out there, brands that might look interesting? And then I have just the follow up question on the promotional situation.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Yes, Nik, we're always on the hunt. And we, if you look at the HERO was acquired last October ‘22. And we've looked at three other potential acquisitions since then, all of which we passed on. But we're always on a hot, we've got quite a strong balance sheet right now, a lot of cash building up, so we've got a bit of a war chest. I would say that the interest rates will obviously affect the bidding process in any one of these acquisitions or auction processes. And obviously we're affected by that as well. But you do want to buy brands that long term are going to be able to grow and interest rates, yes, they may be high for a few years, but they do moderate from, it seems. So you've got to take a long view when you're looking at assets. But there's always something to buy and we've been pretty active at looking at what's available. You had a second question, Nik, on promo?
Nik Modi: Yes, I mean, usually when you see these kinds of unprofitable promos get called, it's usually part of a revenue growth management initiative a more focused revenue growth management initiative. Over the years, I haven't heard you guys talk too much about revenue growth management. So I'm just curious, is there just a more concerted effort to really focus in that area? And that's what's really what's driving some of these choices at the fourth quarter. And any perspective around that would be helpful.
Matt Farrell: Yes, no, that's a timely question, Nik. So our international business was really first out of the gate on revenue growth management. And so we have six subsidiaries. And we have all those six subsidiaries have all been linked up regularly discuss the tactics in improving revenue. And it's all the levers between gross and net. And more recently, our US business reorganized so that we can adopt more of those practices that our international business has honed, but also link the US into those six international subsidiaries. So yes, the whole concept of revenue growth management is taking hold in the company and that contributes to making decisions about unprofitable promotions.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.
Jason English: Hey, folks. Thanks for stopping me in. So a couple quick questions in response to Mr. Lauren’s question. I was surprised to hear you say that you expect inflation next year to be above average. So I guess two questions related to that. First, what's driving it? And second, in context of that, what sort of price of environment do you expect next year? Would you expect to see positive price growth in your key categories and from you in the domestic market?
Rick Dierker : Yes, thanks, Jason. It’s Rick, I would say, So Lauren got me to comment on 2024 a little bit more than we normally would. But what's normal for us in COGS inflation is around 2% of COGS inflation. That's been true for many years, 2013 through 2019. And then it went to 8% during those COVID years, ‘20 to 2022. And then in 2023, it was 4%. My belief is it will be lower than what it is this year, for sure. But a little bit higher than what we've had in the past. And what's driving that is some of the oil-based and resin-based commodities. And that's probably the extent I'll go into right now. The good news is that our productivity, it's not going to be as apparent because productivity for the first time in a long time can actually offset some of these headwinds. And that wasn't the case during the last few years with COVID. In that type of environment, I don't think that pricing will play a major role when manufacturers can cover a lot of their cost headwinds. And in other categories, in other companies, there's other commodities that are going the other way. And so that's why there's deflation in some commodity categories. So that's kind of the short answer from our perspective. We have one price increase that we just rolled out. You heard us talk last quarter about soda ash and baking soda and those cost inputs being up 40% to 50%. We did roll out a price increase on baking soda in October, and that's going to be out in retail. And we don't have further plans to tick price really.
Jason English: Okay, that's helpful. And speaking of commodities, I'm on the website for this MEGALAC product. It's like a pretty commoditized product. And it sounds like you have a new competitive threat coming in, undercutting you. So first talk about it. So I'm assuming it's new. I'm assuming it's still early inning. So can you give us some context to assess the risk? Obviously, if everything else was up to and this drill would bounce back kind of it is big, how big is it? Like how big was it before this? How big is it this quarter? And how do you plan to deal with that headwind going forward?
Matt Farrell: Yes, so MEGALAC has faced low-priced imports for years, even pre-COVID. We were a little protected from that because of how difficult it was to get shipping containers. And so the US market was a little bit more protected, and so MEGALAC did really well during those few years. So once shipping constraints were lifted, competitors came back in, low-priced competitors were there, and we've lost share. This is a very low-profit business, this one product line. And so we are looking hard at how to restructure that business. And so not a lot to talk about today, but I would just tell you, yes, revenue is down, it was volatile, but the impact on profits is minimal.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Anderson from William Blair.
Jon Anderson: Hey, good morning, everyone, thanks for the question. Just one, if it's a shot, it may be too early for you to comment in detail, but you mentioned a couple of times that you have one of the better or best [inaudible]
Matt Farrell: Hey John, if you can hear us, you broke up. We'll give another second.
Jon Anderson: Given kind of the current macro, is the innovation for ‘24 likely to be tilted more towards value than premium? And if you can just kind of characterize it a little bit, given Matt's comments that it's one of the best or better new product lineups that you've had. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, well, look, I'm, it's a logical question, but it is our first week in November and we're going to unveil all those new products in the January, first week of February when we give our outlook for next year. So it's best to just stay tuned on that one, Jon.
Jon Anderson: Great. Thanks. Can I squeeze one more in?
Matt Farrell: Yes, sure. So we didn't really you whiffed on the first one, so yes. Go with the second one.
Jon Anderson: Yes, we'll try again. Just WATERPIK. Could you give us a little bit more detail around where that business is versus your plan year-to-date and really more importantly, what your expectations are going forward as you look to 2024? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Well, look, this was a reset year for WATERPIK. The whole idea was to get close to plan, try to have a level year when it comes to sales. The business has been struggling because during COVID people pretty flush, people staying home, a lot of water flossers got sold in 2021 and even some in ‘22. So that's where the struggle is in ‘23. And then there's always knockoffs that we have to deal with that we see more and more of those as well as some private label, which is -- which we, is not a new thing, but it's been more significant in 2023. But that business has been around for decades. It's it is the Cadillac when it comes to flossers. And we have innovation coming as well for WATERPIK, which we'll talk about at the end of January, first week of February, but innovation and the maintaining the brand equity that the WATERPIK is the premier water flosser is our strategy going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Javier Escalante from Evercore ISI.
Javier Escalante: Good morning, everyone. My question has to do with volumes. If you can comment what was in the comp versus your growth of around 3%, is there something that is going on anniversary in Q4? And also, if you can give us a sense of underlying category growth in terms of volumes and an old channel basis. And how do you stand this [inaudible]? Thank you.
Rick Dierker : Yes, the first one is similar to what I said with Lauren, there's two things that are kind of impacting the comp in Q4. One is even for HERO is we did have some big. So that was a higher comp. The second thing was the laundry promotions. We had some discreet laundry promotions and revenue growth management activities that kind of Matt alluded to is what got pared down in Q4 this year. So those are the two things.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And as far as, I can't really help you with the volumes for our 17 categories. But what I can tell you is that if you look at October and that we had consumption growth in 12 of our 17 categories, so that continues to sustain what we saw in Q3. And remember Q3 was half of our growth was driven by volume. We see that to be 1% or better in Q4. But the good news is that the 12 of our 17 categories, we're seeing growth in October. So it's the beat goes on.
Javier Escalante: But you don't have a sense of whether given the amount of pricing there has been a pullback in actual usage or purchase frequency.
Matt Farrell: No, when you have volume growth, that would suggest that you are seeing consumers migrate to your product year-over-year. We have higher, it should be more cases and more units. And like I said, we expect that to continue in Q4.
Operator: The last question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi.
Filippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. I’ll keep it quick. Thanks. So just a quick question on the marketing expense as percent of sales. You clearly returned to 11%. Should we consider as a new normal for you guys or in the past you've also done closer to 12%. So just wondering if it's a new normal level of investment. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: We've said that 11% is where we wanted to get back to and we thought it was going to be a stair step that would go from 10% in ‘22 to 10.5% in ‘23 and then 11% in ‘24 and we're already now at 11% and we think that's a good level of spend to sustain and grow our brands.
Operator: Thank you, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Farrell for closing comments.
Matt Farrell: Okay, hurray. Hey, thanks for joining us today. We had a great Q3, a lot of momentum going into Q4 and in 2024. And really looking forward to talking to you guys at the end of January or early February with our outlook for ‘24. So thanks for joining us today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating. And we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Church & Dwight’s Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Matt Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Thank you, operator. Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I’ll begin with a review of Q2 results, and then I’ll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is wrapped up, we’ll open the call up for questions. Q2 was an excellent quarter for Church & Dwight. Reported revenue was up 9.7%, exceeding our 7% outlook. And this is thanks to strong results from several brands, including our two most recent acquisitions, HERO and THERABREATH. Organic sales grew 5.4%. This exceeded our 3% Q2 outlook. Gross margin expanded 270 basis points and marketing as a percentage of sales increased 130 basis points. Two items that are worthy of note. First one is 18% of our global sales were purchased online, compared to 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. And second, private label is stable in our categories, both in the U.S. and internationally. Adjusted EPS was $0.92, and this was $0.14 higher than our $0.78 EPS outlook. And that result was driven by higher sales, higher-than-expected gross margin and a lower tax rate. Now I’m going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business had 6.3% organic sales growth and six of our 14 power brands held or gained market share in the quarter. And for context, the brands that grew share represent 65% of our U.S. sales. Now I want to look at a few of the more important categories in the U.S., starting with laundry. So laundry is a real success story in Q2. Church & Dwight closed out the quarter as the fastest-growing overall laundry detergent, liquid detergent, unit dose detergent and scent booster manufacturer in both dollar and unit share. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry continues to see strong consumption growth, driven in part by the continued trade down to value brands and in part by media support behind our new, Give it the Hammer master brand advertising campaign. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent grew share by 90 basis points in the quarter, so we’re now at 14.5% share. And Extra, which is in the extreme value segment of the category, grew consumption 7.2% and gained 20 basis points of share in Q2. ARM & HAMMER litter also continues to perform extremely well with 12.6% growth outpacing the category and growing share. Consumers continue to choose ARM & HAMMER litter offerings and our orange box, in particular, offers great value for the cost constrained cat owner. Turning now to Personal Care. BATISTE grew consumption 12% in the quarter as we continue to build dry shampoo awareness and drive household penetration. While TROJAN delivered share growth and increased share to 68.3% in Q2. HERO, which was acquired last October, grew year-over-year consumption by 66%, gating 4.7 share points to achieve a 17.2% market share in the total acne treatment category. The number of retail distribution points has tripled since we acquired the brand, and we still have room to run as we expand across all classes of trade. The HERO team is doing a spectacular job growing this business, and there continues to be a great deal of excitement at Church & Dwight about the HERO brand. Similarly, THERABREATH, which was acquired in 2021 and is performing extremely well with 100% year-over-year consumption growth in the quarter. THERABREATH grew share of 5.6 points year-over-year to a 13% share of the mouthwash category. The mouthwash category grew 14% in the quarter, and THERABREATH accounted for 50% of the category growth. Distribution of THERABREATH has more than doubled since the acquisition date. So THERABREATH is now the number two non-alcohol mouthwash brand and the clear number three in total mouthwash. And we expect this brand to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight. Regarding a couple of businesses that depressed our 2022 results, WATERPIK is stabilizing, with Q2 coming in close to plan, and this is similar to Q1. While VITAFUSION was close to our plan in the first half, our consumption was down in Q2, 9%, partly due to distribution losses at some retailers due to our supply issues in 2022. The good news is the gummy category was up 1% in Q2 after three successive down quarters. And our job now is to win back retailer confidence and then regain lapsed consumers. So we expect both businesses, this is WATERPIK and VITAFUSION year-over-year to be flat net sales, so although not hurting us in 2023 versus 2022. Next up is international. Our international team is doing a great job, delivering organic sales growth of 6.1% in Q2, driven by broad-based growth in every one of our six subsidiaries in all five regions of our Global Markets Group. And finally, Specialty Products. Specialty Products organic sales decreased 6.5%, but this is primarily due to lower volume in the dairy business as lower-priced imports returned to the U.S. market. I’m going to wrap up my comments right now by saying consumption on our consumer products businesses are strong. A return to volume growth is expected in the second half. In fact, July is off to a very strong start. Our value offerings are performing well, as are our premium offerings, acquisitions are on track. And because we had an excellent first half, and we have a strong outlook for the second half, we are in a position to significantly increase our marketing spend. Last year, we pulled back on marketing due to our fill rate issues. When we started 2023, we intended to increase our marketing from 10% of sales in 2022 to 10.5% of sales in 2023 and then 11% in 2024. So we now intend to ramp up marketing to 11% of sales this year in 2023. In support of our brands and new product launches as business gets back to normal. And now I’m going to turn it over to Rick to give you some color on Q2 and the full year and other investments that we’ll be making in the second half.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We’ll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.92, up 21% to the prior year. As Matt mentioned, the $0.92 was better than our $0.78 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many of our products and higher-than-expected gross margins as well as a lower tax rate. Net sales was up 9.7% and organic sales were up 5.4%. Almost half of the reported revenue growth year-over-year was HERO. Organic sales were once again driven by pricing in Q2 with volumes slightly down. That slight decline was better than expected and turning to the second half, we continue to expect a return to volume growth. Our second quarter gross margin was 43.9%, a 270 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to productivity pricing and strong contributions from higher margin acquisitions that are offsetting inflation. This result exceeded our expectations for the quarter as we saw a greater impact from productivity programs, a better product mix driven by our recent acquisitions. Let me walk you through the Q2 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive 280 basis points impact from price/volume mix, positive 120 basis points from acquisitions, a positive 160 basis point impact from productivity and 10 basis points from currency, partially offset by a drag of 300 basis points due to higher manufacturing costs. For the balance of the year, we expect this trend to continue. Moving to marketing. Marketing was $29 million, up year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 9.1% or 130 basis points higher than Q2 of last year. For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $24 million, a $9.1 million increase due to higher average interest rates. For the full year, we now expect other expense of approximately $100 million. We do not have any looming long-term debt refinancing. In fact, other than the $200 million left in our term loan, August of 2027 is the timing of our next maturity. For income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 17.9% compared to 24.1% in 2022, a decrease of 620 basis points driven by a higher tax benefit from stock option exercises, we now expect the full year rate to be approximately 22%. And now to cash for the first six months of 2023, cash from operating activities increased to $509 million due to higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital. Turning to the full year outlook. Given the strength of our Q2 results and our confidence for the remainder of the year, we’re raising our outlook for sales, gross margin, EPS and cash flow. We now expect the full year 2023 reported sales growth to be approximately 8% and organic sales growth to be approximately 5%. Given the strength of the business, we see opportunities to make incremental investments in our brands and capabilities in future quarters. We now expect full year reported gross margin to expand 200 basis points. Compared to our previous outlook, we see commodity cost favorability, higher productivity and faster growth from our higher margin recent acquisitions. While we have seen some pockets of lower inflationary pressure, since our prior outlook, we continue to expect net inflation for the year. For perspective, we expect $120 million of manufacturing cost increases in 2023, much better than the $290 million we saw in 2021 and the $250 million in 2022, but still elevated from historical levels. Speaking of history, if we look back at history from 2010 to 2019, we typically had 2% of COGS as inflation. During the COVID impacted years of 2020 to 2022, we saw an 8% of COGS impact. And in 2023, we’re seeing about a 4% inflation rate. So currently, we see commodities like ethylene down 20% year-over-year. However, going the other way, we see soda ash up 50%, soda ash is now used with lithium for lithium carbonate, which is then used in lithium batteries and solar panels. This demand spike combined with pressure on the supply side. So for example, China is the largest supplier of soda ash globally and has had intermittent supply issues, and that’s causing upwards pressure on price. So the point is we’re not in a deflationary period as of yet. Wrapping up gross margins, we have made a lot of progress. However, for the full year, we still expect to be about 200 basis points below our pre-COVID margin levels. It’s a lot of opportunity over the next few years. We intend to increase marketing as a percent of net sales to 11%. This is great news as we previously anticipated getting back up to 11% in 2024, and the fact that we’re able to get there sooner than initially anticipated, we’ll position the business well for the future. We expect SG&A both in dollars and as a percent of sales to increase compared to 2022. The increase in SG&A is expected to be larger than what was assumed in our prior outlook as a strong business performance increases instead of compensation and as we make strategic investments. As in past years when we have strong business performance for investing for the future, these investments are focused in two areas. First, growth with higher marketing investments and R&D investments around MPD [ph], as well as accelerating product registrations in international markets. Second would be efficiency, investments in automation and technology. We now expect full year EPS to be approximately 6%. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance includes a step up of marketing that we’ve talking about in higher SG&A. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $1 billion. Previously, we expected to be $950 million. The $50 million increase is driven by higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital. Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $250 million. As we continue to make capacity investments and we expect to return to historical levels of 2% of sales by 2025. Strong performance in the first half of the year drove 12% EPS growth as a result of accelerating investments, we expect second half EPS growth to be flat. And for Q3 specifically, we have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of 8%, approximately 4% for organic and gross margin expansion. We also expect a significant increase year-over-year in marketing spend as well as SG&A. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.66 per share, a 13% decrease from last year’s adjusted Q3, as investment spending has weighted more towards Q3. So to summarize, a strong six months of the year are behind us, a return to volume growth in the back part of the year, a lot of momentum as we move into 2024. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Carey: Hey, good morning.
Matt Farrell: Hey, Chris.
Chris Carey: So on my math, this is the first return to organic sales growth, in personal care since the beginning of 2021, unless I’m calculating that wrong. And clearly there was some commentary around WATERPIK and vitamins being on plan. Nevertheless does feel like a bit of a step change on this kind of important area of the P&L. And I wonder if you could just frame, what’s going on, on an underlying basis in that business to drive this reacceleration. I know comps are getting easier, but we hear so much about WATERPIK and FLAWLESS and sometimes, not the rest of the underlying drivers of organic sales here. And really, I’m just trying to get a sense of the full delivery of this personal care portfolio into the back half of the year, specifically as HERO comes into the base.
Matt Farrell: Okay. I’ll start. And this is Matt, Chris and then Rick can pile on. So I mentioned WATERPIK and vitamins. So that we said on a full year basis that they would be flattish in net sales. So first half, they’re both down year-over-year, and the expectation is up in the second half. So you’re right about that. They’re going to start contributing to the inflection of personal care starting to grow. In international, we have BATISTE and STERIMAR where we’ve been somewhat capacity constrained, and that’s debating right now too. So that’s going to help us on the international side. And BATISTE continues to grow in the U.S. continue to be able to expand, as I mentioned in my remarks awareness and also household penetration. THERABREATH is a juggernaut. And we bought that business probably had around $100 million in sales. Our ambition long-term is for that to be a $0.5 billion business globally. So it’s – that’s going to continue to grow. We’ve got lots of distribution gains already this year and more ahead of us. And the same is true for HERO. Here we just bought last October, we’ve got a fantastic team driving that business that they’ve – by and large have all stuck around with us, and we want them to stay for a long time because we have so much success and so much runway ahead of us. So I give you a little sense for a half a dozen brands here that are contributing to the growth.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I would probably just add Chris, it’s Rick. And Matt’s exactly right, BATISTE, THERABREATH, all those things are happening. You’re right. Your math is correct. Q1 organically for personal care was negative. Q2 is positive. We expect Q3, Q4 to be positive. So we do see the inflection point as well.
Matt Farrell: And the good news here that’s the high margin part of the business is personal care.
Chris Carey: Okay. Yes. And that’s just one thing I wanted to confirm that mix should become a bit more of a tailwind for gross margins in the back half as well. So I think you just – you took care of that. The one other then I’ll get back in. We saw some incremental pricing in the Nielsen data around laundry. Just wanted to confirm that if that’s true or not, sent in the way, if there was pricing taken in the business, and then maybe just contextualize if that was the case, why it happened and how you’re thinking about kind of maintaining value and volume share in the laundry business in the U.S. go forward. Thanks so much.
Rick Dierker: We haven’t taken any incremental pricing on laundry. I mean, there’s still the impact of concentration as an example, but that’s not really pricing. So we have not taken any incremental pricing.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And Chris, the only area where we have announced an increase in price to retailers is in baking soda for the obvious reasons with the 50% increase in soda ash that, that Rick made reference to.
Chris Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking that question. Also, congrats on a really nice quarter.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Thanks.
Rupesh Parikh: So just going back to your comment here in the U.S. consumer business where I think you gained six – share on six – gain to maintain share on six out of your 14 power brands category. How are you thinking about this for the balance of year? Do you expect that metric to improve as we get to Q3 and Q4, especially as maybe some of your advertising picks up?
Rick Dierker: Hey, Rupesh, we do think we’re going to improve that as we go through the year as our marketing investments behind it. As our fill levels comp year-over-year are comparable. But I think even a better metric is instead of 6 of 14, we’ve been talking about 65% of our net sales have gained share. So that’s our large brands are winning.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And Rupesh, some of the categories in personal care that, that are down or like battery pregnancy test kits, cold shortening, these are small categories, so but they count as one of the 14. So we’re trying to get the focus more on the big brands and how they’re performing.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then given we’ve seen margins approved not only for you guys, but also other players out there just curious what you’re seeing the competitor promotional backdrop right now, then just how you think about the promotional environment for the balance of the year.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, look, as far as promotions go, generally the conversation goes around household. So if you look at the laundry category in total, it’s sequentially, it’s up about 80, 90 bps from Q1 to Q2. And if you look at liquid laundry detergent, that’s up a couple of hundred basis points in sold on deal from Q1 to Q2. On the other hand, if you look at unit dose sequentially, it’s down 340 basis points from Q1 to Q2. So all in, I’d say if you look at the laundry category in total, it’s not any – not significantly more promotional in Q2 than Q1. And then if you look at laundry, or pardon me, a litter sold on deal, just the last few quarters, it’s been pretty steady. It’s been around 15% sold on deal. So I would – and then the last one would be a vitamin business VMS. That actually is, it’s less promotional in Q2 than Q1. So I would say that from where we sit and we look at our most promotional categories, we think it’s that things are pretty steady.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. Thank you. I’ll pass it along.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Hey, your next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead.
Bryan Adams: Good morning, guys. This is Bryan Adams on for Peter. Thanks for taking a question. So just looking at the implied I think you said up to or the back half that implies around up to 2.2% or a little over 2% growth in volumes in the second half. Should we be thinking about that as a sequential build or is it more just looking at the year ago comparisons with how challenging 3Q was? Is it reasonable to expect that 3Q volumes might be on par or even above that of 4Q?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Hey, Bryan. We’ve kind of said up to 50% in the second half is going to be volume driven. We think that is impactful. It inflects positively, I think because of the comp, maybe Q3 is a little bit better than Q4.
Bryan Adams: Okay. Great. And then just one more quick one on specialty products. I think entering the quarter, the expectation was for that business to be slightly negative this year, and you’ve had another choppy quarter here. I know you called out the reasons why with the lower price import. I think on par from an expert on the puts and take of the business here. But just looking ahead, should we expect kind of a similarly challenged backdrop as we head into the second half? Are you expecting any improvement here? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. I’ll give you the division kind of organic outlook here we are in July, so approximately 5% for domestic, 6% to 7% for international and negative for SPD. And that gets us to approximately 5%. So we continue to think we will have the same issue that we experienced in Q2 for the balance of the year.
Bryan Adams: Awesome. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Lauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I just want to maybe try to ask a bit of a longer term question, which is that now, it feels you’ve got really good visibility into gross margin recovery to pre-COVID levels, through the worst in terms of kind of the discretionary driven volatility on top line, and with all of that reinvestment set up to get back to not quite 12%, but a huge step change this year. Now the things are kind of more settled, if you will. You also talked about some incremental investments in efficiency. And so I was wondering if we could just hear a little bit about kind of longer range planning as you think about investments in capabilities, in supply chain, which I know we’ve talked about in pieces, but if you kind of think over a multi-year view, perhaps how you think about investments that you may want to be making more in kind of infrastructure to support the business with the hindsight being 2020 of some of the operational headwinds that you ultimately faced during the global pandemic that nobody could have planned for. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. It’s a good question. Hey, you’ve heard us say in the past that we think that sales per employee is an underappreciated measurement of a company’s performance. But we focus on that quite a bit. And Rick can kind of chime in with some details, but we look at how do we make our people and the plants more efficient through automation, and how do we do the same with respect to the white collar office workers. We have – we’re going to be close to $6 billion in sales next year we got around 5,000, it’s 5,200 or 5,300 employees. And the goal here is can you continue to grow your top line without necessarily growing the number of plants that you have or the number of employees that you have to make the team far more efficient. But Rick can give you a couple of examples of RPA in the number of projects we’ve done in the past, how many we plan to do this year and in the future as an example of how you try to make your certainly your office workers more productive. And of course, we like so many other companies out there are now looking to AI and chat and say, well, how can we leverage that to make everybody more productive? But Rick, you can throw a few examples on the table.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So it’s all in the backdrop of making sure that our evergreen model of 25 basis points of SG&A leverage each and every year is solid for the next five, 10 years. And so two examples, like one Matt mentioned is like RPA. So one of the investments we’re making right now with automation and technology is, we have 20 or 30 projects that represents thousands and thousands of hours that we’re automating. And that way that our people have more capacity to do other work, which is really impactful as we build the company. And we have more and more brands every day. The second one we’re doing is we’re making significant technology investments. I think you’ve heard us talk about before, but we put an ERP system into China, as an example, we’re investing into an ERP system for our GMG business, which is our fastest growing international business. So we’re putting technology, we’re putting – enabling technology to – so that we can scale and grow. We have SG&A investments for people and regulatory and R&D, so that business can continue to grow at the rate it’s been growing at.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: Thanks, Lauren.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys.
Matt Farrell: Hey, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: So just along the vein of the last question, clearly, a lot of reinvestment in the back half of the year relative to original plan. Can you just talk about the level of payback you expect from those investment areas, as well as the timing of payback? Obviously, marketing is a line item that’s highly visible to us, but it seems like there are a bunch of other areas in terms of higher R&D, greater registrations technology, you just mentioned ERP in China, Rick. So those are more nebulous and harder to judge. So just how do you think about the payback and are you basically pulling forward some incremental investment that would’ve occurred in 2024 as we think about this reinvestment in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So in terms of payback, we’ll start with marketing. Marketing, we’re spending $30 million more, where are we spending that incremental marketing. Well, it’s around brands like THERABREATH, like HERO, the ARM & HAMMER campaign given the hammer, which has been great in the recessionary time. So all those things are driving the top line. We’re seeing an immediate payback, right? We talked about distribution gains for THERABREATH and HERO. Sometimes, these are the first national campaigns they’ve ever experienced and consumption is on fire, and that’s as a result of marketing and distribution gains. So the payback there is rapid. On the SG&A, two-thirds of that SG&A number is incentive comp year-over-year as our results are outperforming. And then maybe a one-third is the investments. And those investments from more one time in nature. And yes, like for registrations, we’ve pulled forward a couple years of registrations we may do that again in terms of it gets us ready to grow even faster, and it gives you more optionality to expand in different countries around the world. Anything, Matt, you would add?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I’d just say, Dara, we’re very consistent. We had a long standing practice that when the business is performing well, we look at that as an opportunity to reinvest. So things we – initiatives we might’ve had next year, the year after, we say, hey, we could fund it now, let’s do it. And as with respect to marketing, that’s really a no brainer. Because marketing correlates with this – with the health of brands and the strength of your brand equity, and you can’t live at 10% of sales. And there’s another example of something we were going to ramp up in 2024, that’s – we got ahead of it now. So that is not going to be a drag year-over-year in 2024 versus 2023. That ramp up to 11%. So I think these are all good things.
Dara Mohsenian: That’s helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask more about your point on volumes for the more discretionary categories. Not to take away from obviously the improvement in the other areas in the down trade that you benefit, but some of these categories, of course, the 20%, I believe is still around what they represent in your revenues. So I understand that your company very easy comparisons. But consumption wise, I wonder why consumers will go back to FLAWLESS and WATERPIK given the headwinds in the category. And in general, I think we’ve heard all companies talk about like, well, we will see volumes rebounding. It’s not like your volumes were relatively outperforming, so I wonder x those two or those three categories, including VMS. So what makes you comfortable with the rebounding volumes that is predicated in your guidance? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, let’s start with FLAWLESS. We haven’t said a word about FLAWLESS, nor will we, it’s a small brand for us now. First, WATERPIK, just remember, we enter the year, if you go back six months, we said, hey, the first six months, we’re going to be choppy here. We had inventory in the channel that we had to work through. We had an imbalance out there that’s behind us now. So that obviously has a direct impact on our sales in the second half. And same with vitamins. That was our biggest problem child when it came to supply in 2022. We got punished for that by suppliers where we lost displays, some cases lost distribution. So consequently, we took that on the chin in the first half, but that started to improve in the second half as far as the number of displays we’re able to get in. And some of the variants that we weren’t able to make last year that we’re going to start introducing backend example, a magnesium gummy for example. So for those two businesses, we would say, hey, there’s reasons to believe that there’s going to start inflecting in the second half.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And so I’ll just give you a couple comments too, Andrea. In the back half of 2022, those businesses were down. So we expect those businesses to be really, like Matt said earlier a little – a couple of them a little positive in the back half and really flat for the year. But when you add up all those three businesses and the impact they’ve had on the company, I’ve quoted it a couple times, but in Q4 it was a 4% drag, in Q1, they were a 3% drag. In Q2, they were only a 1% drag, and we expect them to be flat in the second half. So it’s already improved, I guess, what we’re saying.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Steve Powers: Thanks. On VITAFUSION, just maybe a little bit more detail on your visibility into stabilization and kind of winning back those retailers and consumers? Just kind of where you are in the process and how long you think it will take?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, a lot of work’s been gone into this business. We’re relooking at our packaging, our graphics, our messaging, the black eye we got last year gave us a chance to stand down and take a hard look at the brand and look ahead. I think over the next 12 months you’re going to start seeing some changes on shelf and how we go to market. I wouldn’t disclose any more than that right now. Anything to add, Rick?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I mean, for vitamins, I think it’s – when we have our TDPs get impacted a little bit because we’re in the penalty box for supply and we got to do what Matt alluded to. We’re going to get – we’ve gotten more displays, we’re adding advertising, we’re looking at our messaging, and then it takes nine months or so to make that case for the retailer so you can get the distribution back into a leading position.
Steve Powers: Okay. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for that. I guess, just going back to maybe kind of the question Dara raised and that Lauren brought up on the reinvestment rates. I think the reinvestments you’re doing now were very well telegraphed and as you’ve articulated, necessary for lots of reasons. But I guess, the idea, Matt, as you outlined it, the history of the business has been when things are good, you reinvest kind of get ahead. I guess to me, there’s a little bit of tension between that dynamic and then the other side of it trying to catch up from sort of a lost year in 2022. So as you go forward, do you – is the philosophy to run the business as you have from here forward, which effectively means we’re kind of getting back to more of an evergreen mentality off of this newly established base? Or is there more of a desire at some point to recoup some of these upfront investments and kind of return to trend off of maybe a 2021 base? Like how do you think about that from just how you’re managing the business from here?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, look, I’ve been here for a long time, since 2006, and we’ve lived with our evergreen model for many, many years and it’s served us well. And last year was an anomaly for us. And we said, okay, we got to get back to our algorithm. And we said we had a big step up in 2023, and by virtue of what we’ve shown in the first half we’re going to get to 6% EPS growth in 2023. We’re going to get marketing back up to 11% of sales, which is how we want to run the railroad. And we sold 200 basis points light versus what our gross margins were pre-COVID. So when we get to the end of 2023, that’s ahead of us. So it’s going to take us a few years to get back there, but as we improve our gross margin in 2024 and 2025, that’s obviously going to throw off a fair amount of profit. So if you look at the – just the first half of this year we had double digit gross profit growth. That’s a great trend. So I’d say that the short story is, is that the success we’ve had in the first six months, the strength we see in the second half certainly on sales and gross profit growth gives us greater confidence, so we can return to our normal evergreen model algorithm in 2024. But we’re not – it’s too early to be calling numbers at this point, but I think going to 11% of marketing as a percentage of sales this year is a big deal. It won’t be a headwind in next year, that 2024 versus 2023, and we still have the ambition to grow gross margin significantly in the next couple of years. So that’s a short story about how we think about the P&L, Steve.
Steve Powers: Okay. Thank you very much.
Matt Farrell: All right.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Anna Lizzul: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. I was wondering on the distribution gains with Hero and THERABREATH. Could you comment on where you’re seeing the largest gains in distribution with your various retail partners? And are there any challenges to gaining distribution? Also, to what extent do you think you have more runway on distribution? And do you have any concerns from some of the larger brands that have been innovating in this space with similar offerings that might have distribution already well established? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, and when I – as I go through, you’re going to have to remind me about the question three and four. As far as where the distribution is coming from, you take Hero. So Hero was built through Amazon, Target and Ulta, and those were the mainstay retailers that the Hero team chose to grow their brand. So consequently every other retailer in class of trade is an opportunity for us. And so we’ve – that’s what we’ve been pursuing. We’ve been going after a mass, which would be companies like – retailers like Walmart, the big drug chains, et cetera, and then food. And the opportunity is A, would be distribution and B would be facings. Now, if you go to THERABREATH, THERABREATH was more developed as far as the – throughout many classes of trade, but not with respect to facings and how many variants are shown. So there’s two things happening with THERABREATH. One is, yes, we’re getting more retailers, but we’re spreading out more on shelf. And as – because of this is the – actually the highest priced mouthwash, it’s accounting for 50% of the category growth in mouthwash in Q2. Now the retailers see that, their penny profit is high on THERABREATH mouthwash. So consequently, they’re interested in helping us grow. So we can anticipate more facings in the future particularly in 2024. So I think both of those brands have a big tailwind going forward.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I would just add, Anna that both of those brands have a lot of runway left on TDPs. Even if you look at THERABREATH for example, it’s maybe third or fourth in the segment on TDPs. And the next step change maybe is another competitor that has 1,100. So there’s still room to run.
Matt Farrell: Yes. I mean, the velocity and the sales that we have would suggest that we should have far more shelf space than we have today.
Anna Lizzul: Thank you. And just any concern, I guess, from some of the larger brands that have been innovating in this space with some similar offerings that already have some distribution well established? Just any concern from that?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Are you referring to the acne category?
Anna Lizzul: Yes, both in the acne category and in the mouthwash category?
Matt Farrell: Well, look, we welcome competition. As far as patches go, the advantage MIGHTY PATCH has is number one, it was first and number two, its patch is more efficacious than other patches. So I think that is what’s going to make the difference going forward. Yes. And as far as THERABREATH goes, THERABREATH’s got a different formula than other mouth washes, even in the mouth washes in non-alcohol. So no, I would say, we feel advantage with respect to our offering. Not just our formulas, but also our packaging and our go-to market strategy and our use of social media.
Anna Lizzul: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning,
Matt Farrell: Hey Bill.
Bill Chappell: Hey just a little bit more on sodium bicarbonate. Just I don’t remember, maybe you said what the percentage that is in terms of cost goods sold, but also – because I always enjoy the discussion on animal husbandry. I thought the key part of the Specialty Ingredients business was feeding sodium bicarbonate to cows to produce more milk. So why would that business not be passing out pretty meaningful price increases as well and driving sales?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Sodium bicarbonate is not a big part of the animal business within SPD. As far as the – we got into the animal business about 50 years ago when we learned that that we were selling super sacks of baking soda to big bakers and they were selling out the back door to some dairies, and they were sort of used putting in the feed was sort of like Alka-Seltzer for cows. That then got us into other nutritional products, prebiotics, probiotics over time. So the story with respect to soda ash and sodium bicarbonate is largely on the consumer side of the business. Now, especially product business, two-thirds is animal, one-third is bulk sodium bicarbonate. And there you would see that we have been raising price. But this is just a – it’s a $100 million business, so it’s not a real needle move for us, Bill, when we raise price in bulk sodium bicarbonate.
Bill Chappell: Got it. So it’s not enough to drive sales.
Matt Farrell: Yes. On the consumer side it’s a – it’s a much bigger deal. We don’t typically quote what percentage of our COGS is sodium bicarbonate or baking soda. But remember, we use baking soda in a lot of different products. It’s in toothpaste, its underarm deodorant; it’s in cat litter, laundry detergent, yes, it’s – we use it quite a bit, so it doesn’t matter.
Bill Chappell: Okay. And then second, and I might have missed a but, I mean, in terms of the strength of your results in the past couple quarters, you would leaned on or not leaned on, indicated that consumer trade down was driving it. I mean, is that still a big driver? I mean, it seems like it is more just the strength of the brands and the categories and or is it really you’re continuing to see a nervous consumer?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well look the, we’ve had four quarters now, four or five quarters now of trade down. So we saw a lot of that’s happening mid-22 and it’s going to continue through mid-23. So we would say now you’re sort of starting to lap the trade down, but – but the ARM & HAMMER brand is continues to grow and like I said, July is equally as strong as year-over-year as Q1 and Q2. In fact, as Rick has pointed out, and we pointed out in the release, a lot of the year-over-year comparison it’s not just for Church & Dwight, but most CPGs has been colored by price. And the expectation now is we’re going to go positive in volume in Q3 and Q4. So we expect that the launch piece is going to be one of those participants for positive volume in Q3.
Bill Chappell: Got it. Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Olivia Tong: Great, thanks. Good morning. First question is around marketing. If you could just elaborate in terms of how much of the marketing spend is going towards maybe some more value to your products where you are seeing some of that trade down benefit versus some of the higher end thorough THERABREATH, HERO personal care type products?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Well, you heard Rick mention that HERO and THERABREATH are virtue being part of Church & Dwight. We certainly have the wherewithal to invest quite a bit on two brands that are growing significantly and have a lot of runway ahead of them. The other place of destination would be which I mentioned briefly in my opening remarks, and that’s our master brand campaign, which is Give it the Hammer and to Give it the Hammer campaign is really resonating with consumers. And I’m just talking about your average consumer out there. It’s really resonated with them because it really halos all of our different categories and it’s – it’s consistent and we came up with this as we entered the year and we said, hey, we got all this trade down going on. ARM & HAMMER is the working man’s brand. So let’s get behind that and let’s come up with a campaign that’s going to support that, that thesis. And it’s working. That brand is really scoring super high and we’re continuing to get behind it. We’re going to get behind it in the second half continually.
Olivia Tong: Right. And then just following up, in terms of your expectations for volume to turn positive in second half and being up for the fiscal year, as you mentioned in your prepared mark; can you talk about your view on price mix in second half? And then maybe on price, what’s – what’s already in place that hasn’t lapsed yet? And whether you have incremental plans in the second half of the year?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Hey Olivia, so there’s – there’s, most of our pricing has lapped. Lot of our laundry, litter, OxiClean pricing happened in July a year ago. So most of the pricing has been lapsed, there’s a little bit still to come. That’s why we’re saying maybe 50/50 in the back half of the year. And then the only price in action that we’ve talked about is baking. So that’s the only one left from a list price perspective. We always want to go optimize trade and revenue growth management, but with the 50% increase in...
Matt Farrell: Yes. And BATISTE would be the other one that we haven’t completely lapped. All the price increases, so that’s going to be part of the story for price in the second half is dry shampoo.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead.
Filippo Falorni: Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask a question on private label. I know some of your larger categories don’t have a lot of exposure, but maybe you can comment on private label performance in some of the categories that do have the exposure? And then Matt, your point on consumer trade down, kind of starting to cycle that. What are you assuming in your second half guidance, you’re assuming a continuation of the trend, an acceleration of the trend, work straight down; any color will be helpful? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well look there’s a – there’s a half a dozen categories where we have the private label competition and I would say Litter is usually the one we’ve – we’ve talked most about. But that’s been stable. For the last three quarters, it’s around 13% Q4 – Q1 and Q2. As far as trade down goes in household, it’s a consumer is more likely to trade down. Now we’ve talked about trade down within laundry to ARM & HAMMER, we’ve had four quarters of that, as I just mentioned the previous question. We do – based on how July is setting up it looks like that’s continuing to happen. Well, I do expect it’s going to abate a little bit, but one thing that’s notable about trade down is – is which I said in my opening remarks is that Extra, which is a extreme value detergent. It grew 7.5% consumption in Q2 and it actually gained share. And that was the first time, and that was like 14 quarters that Extra gain share. So that would suggest that there’s a trade down that’s – and Q2, remember this is our most recent quarter, first time that’s happened in 14 quarter. So you’d say, yes, there’s still a tendency to trade down particularly on the household side. When it comes to personal care, particularly health related categories far less likely to see trade down. So I think it’s more of a household story.
Filippo Falorni: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you guys.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Our last question for today comes from Javier Escalante from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Javier Escalante: Hi. Good morning everyone. Another permutation on the spending and reinvestment and what to expect from it in the second half; it feels as if do you guys have built a financial benefit from that spending the higher advertising spending in the second half or not? It’s just basically; you are assuming that you are just rebuilding a baseline of investment?
Matt Farrell: Well, look, some of it is – it’s hard to parse out, well, how much is restoring your typical spend that to maintain brand health and how much is actually going to reduce your top line. As Rick said, I think it’s more likely that it’s going to help THERABREATH and HERO in the second half. The brands that are already doing extremely well, just port some gasoline on those.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And Javier, I would say it also positions us well as we enter 2024. So that should be taken into account as well.
Javier Escalante: And if things continue as well, say, right, that essentially gross margin ahead, top line ahead, that upside, do you rather say close the year with 12% advertising spending or you would rather balance that out and flow some of the upside to the bottom line? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, I mean, our outlook is what our outlook is. That’s our best forecast of results. So right now, we’re saying we’re extremely happy that we got the 6% EPS growth while bringing marketing back up to 11%, which we thought was going to take two years. We’re doing it all in one year and also making some investments for the future. So not really ready to talk about what we’re going to do if we have upside to that.
Rick Dierker: Yes. But look at – just to pile on gross margin expansion, gross profit growing. These are all great things and volumes inflecting some positive in the second half. There’s a lot of barrels right now for the company.
Javier Escalante: Absolutely. Thank you very much.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for closing remarks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Hey, thanks everybody for joining us today, and look forward to talking to you again at the end of the third quarter. Have a good one.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 10:00:00) =====
Matthew Farrell: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today.
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Farrell: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is wrapped up, we'll open the call for questions. So Q1 was a solid quarter. Reported revenue was 10.2%. Organic sales grew 5.7% and exceeded our 1% Q1 outlook. Of the 10.2% reported sales growth beat our outlook of 4%, thanks to stronger results from several brands, including Hero, THERABREATH, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER litter and exceptionally strong sales growth in our international business. The other good news is that the vitamin business and the WATERPIK business hit their Q1 sales plan, and were right on expectations. And finally, it's also fair to say that we had a degree of conservatism in our original Q1 outlook, both top line and bottom line. Our Q1 top line growth reflects the strength of our brands, both premium and value and also our focus on execution. The combination of consumer demand and improved case fill, which is now over 93% in the U.S. is resulting in strong revenue growth. Something else that is noteworthy, we had flat volume growth in Q1, which is an encouraging sign after declining volumes in the last six quarters, and we now expect volume growth in our full year net sales outlook. Adjusted EPS was $0.85, which was $0.10 higher than our $0.75 EPS outlook. And that was driven by higher-than-expected sales in the U.S. and especially in our international business, which posted 11.6% organic growth. In Q1, global online sales as a percentage of total sales was over 16%, and we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 16%. Now private label shares remained consistent with historical weighted averages. Both domestic and internationally, private label is stable in our categories. And now I'm going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business had 5.5% organic sales growth, and 8 of our 14 power brands held or gained market share in the quarter. Now I want to look at a few of the important categories in the U.S., and I want to start with laundry. If we look at the big picture, value laundry detergent grew 9%, while premium detergent declined 3%. So the trade down to value detergent continues into 2023. During Q1, the liquid laundry category grew 3.6%, while ARM & HAMMER grew 9.3%. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent grew share by 80 basis points in the quarter to 14.3%. So with more consumers migrating to ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, we have the potential for a long-term benefit to the ARM & HAMMER brand similar to the last recession. Now over in litter, the category grew 12.7%, while ARM & HAMMER litter grew 13.5%. So we gained market share in the quarter. We did see a trade down from our premium ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter to our ARM & HAMMER value litter, which is in the orange box. So consumers are staying in the ARM & HAMMER franchise. And our Give it the Hammer advertising campaign, which halos met the many categories that ARM & HAMMER competes in is resonating with consumers. Now in dry shampoo, the dry shampoo category was up 11.8% in Q1, driven by BATISTE consumption, which was up 20%. We now enjoy a 46.2% market share in dry shampoo. In the condom category, the condom category was up 4.1% in Q1, while TROJAN consumption was up 5.3%. There again, we gained 80 basis points of market share, thanks to our new TROJAN bare skin raw condom and the success of more targeted marketing. Our most recent acquisitions, THERABREATH mouthwash and HERO are performing extremely well. THERABREATH, which we acquired in December of 2021, had just a great quarter with 70% consumption growth. THERABREATH grew share 6.8 points to 22.5% of the alcohol-free mouthwash. And as promised when we bought the brand, distribution of THERABREATH has doubled since we acquired it in December of 2021. THERABREATH is now the number two nonalcohol mouthwash brand and the clear number four in total mouthwash. We expect this brand to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight. Now ZICAM, this is a December 2020 acquisition, also delivered strong results this quarter. ZICAM is the number one brand in the cold shortening segment with a 78% share. Now to our latest acquisition, HERO, which grew year-over-year consumption by 43.5% and gained 1.6 share points to achieve a 9.1% market share in the total acne treatment category. And distribution has expanded by 50% since the October acquisition date. And as we said in the release, there continues to be a great deal of excitement around HERO -- about the HERO brand and especially the HERO team. From our oldest brand to our recent acquisitions, our brands are driving category growth. I'm going to give you a few examples. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, which has a 14% share of the liquid laundry category drove 35% of the category growth. In dry shampoo category, BATISTE has a category-leading 46% share, but contributed 75% of the category growth. And in the mouthwash category, THERABREATH makes up 11% of the total category but delivered over 50% of the growth in mouthwash. Next up is international. Our international business delivered organic growth of 11.6% in Q1, driven by strong growth in the subsidiaries and double-digit sales growth from our Global Markets Group, and that was quite balanced across all of our global regions. And the growth was headlined by BATISTE, vitamins, femfresh, WATERPIK and gravel. And as far as the consumer goes, similar to the United States, unemployment remains low in our international countries where we have subsidiaries. However, in many of these markets, particularly in Europe, the consumer is facing inflation in energy and food, but so far, consumption has remained strong. In China, while it is a relatively small market for us, we are experiencing stronger growth in Q1 and remain optimistic about the full year apart. And finally, Specialty Products. Specialty Products organic sales decreased 5.9% primarily due to lower volume in the dairy business as low price imports returned to the U.S. market. I want to wrap up my remarks right now by saying consumption is strong. Our value offerings are performing well as are our premium offerings. Acquisitions are on track. We're ramping up our marketing this year in support of our brands and new product launches. And we expect to have the opportunity to invest even more behind our brands in future quarters. And now, I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some more color on Q1.
Richard Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.85, up 2.4% the prior year. The $0.85 was better than our $0.75 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many of our products, and higher-than-expected gross margins. Reported revenue was up 10.2% and organic sales were up 5.7%. About half of the reported revenue growth year-over-year was HERO. Organic sales were once again driven by pricing in Q1. However, as Matt mentioned, the fact that volume was flat, was encouraging and gives us confidence that we will return to volume growth later this year. Matt covered the segments, so I'll go right into gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin was 43.5%, a 90 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to improved pricing, productivity and the impact of the HERO acquisition, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs. Let me walk you through the Q1 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive 160 basis points impact from price/volume mix, positive 120 basis points from acquisitions, a positive 160 basis points from productivity and 10 basis points from currency, partially offset by a drag of a 360 basis point impact due to higher manufacturing costs, including inventory charges related to discretionary brands primarily flawless. For the balance of the year, we still expect sequential improvement in gross margin year-over-year expansion throughout the year. Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $20 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 8.6% or 70 basis points higher than Q1 of last year. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 90 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $23 million, an $8.6 million increase due to higher interest rates. Our expectations for interest rates for the remainder of the year remain unchanged from our prior guidance. We do not have any looming long-term debt refinancings. In fact, August of 2027 is the timing of our next maturity. For income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.4% compared to 23.2% in 2022, an increase of 120 basis points. We continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%. And now to cash. For the first three months of 2023, cash from operating activities increased to $273 million due to higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $950 million. Previously, we expected $925 million. The $25 million increase is driven by higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital. Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $250 million as we continue to make capacity investments, and we expect to return to historical levels by 2025. And now for the full year outlook. Given the strength of our Q1 results and our confidence for the remainder of the year, we are raising our outlook for sales, EPS, gross margin and cash flow. We now expect the full year 2023 reported sales growth to be approximately 6% to 7% and organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%. We now expect full year EPS in the range of 2% to 4% growth. Given the strength of the business, we see opportunities to make incremental investments in our brands and capabilities in future quarters. We now expect full year reported gross margin to expand approximately 120 basis points. And as we expect pricing and productivity to more than offset inflation. Our full year inflation expectations remain unchanged from our previous outlook. Gross margin is expected to benefit from pricing, pack size changes, longer concentration and the full year impact of the higher-margin HERO business. As you read in the release, two items of note that are aiding our margin recovery are new litter pricing that went into effect on February 1 and the latest round of concentration for laundry. We intend to increase marketing as a percent of net sales to 10.5%. We continue to expect SG&A both in dollars and as a percent of net sales to increase compared to 2022 as the company's incentive compensation plan returns to normal levels in 2023. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes a step-up in our level of marketing investment as well as higher SG&A. For Q2, we have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of approximately 7%, organic sales growth of approximately 3% and gross margin expansion and higher marketing spending. The math would show a sequential decline in sales growth, but it's easy to explain. First, distribution pipeline fill for HERO and THERABREATH accounted for 1% of growth in Q1 that will not repeat in Q2. The other is around quarterly comps and how that impacts the current year. For the domestic business, there was a large improvement in case fill in Q1 to Q2 last year, which leads to a tougher comp in Q2 of this year compared to Q1 last year. As an example, our international business in Q1 in 2022, organic growth was 0 and in Q2 it was 6.5% in 2022. As a result, adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.78 per share, a 2.6% increase from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] For your first question comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Chris, please go ahead.
Chris Carey: Hi, good morning.
Richard Dierker: Hi Chris.
Chris Carey: So I just wanted to ask about - 
Richard Dierker: Chris, you're breaking out.
Matthew Farrell: Operator, why don't we go to the next question and Chris can get back in the queue.
Operator: Right. Sure. No worries. One moment please for your next question. Right. So for your next question, it comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you guys hear me okay?
Matthew Farrell: Yes.
Kevin Grundy: Great. So I wanted to start on the gross margin outlook. Some of the key drivers there, maybe how you're seeing that a little bit differently given the strong start to the year and some of the moderation in commodities and sort of tie that in with how you're thinking about potential reinvestment. So the outlook now, up 120 basis points on gross margin year-over-year. The prior outlook was up 100 to 120. So modestly better. Rick, maybe just comment on how you're seeing the contribution from pricing, commodities and productivity sort of the key levers? And then Matt, maybe you could want to chime in on just how you're thinking about restoring advertising and marketing levels. It was kind of a stair-step function, at least that was sort of the thinking coming into the year. Is there anything maybe accelerating that sort of within the context of advertising and marketing had been 12% of sales, get down to 10% this year, the thinking is 10.5%. How should we be thinking about the potential reinvestment if gross margin exceeds expectations? And I have a follow-up.
Richard Dierker: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. I'll go first. I think gross margin, we said in the release and in my script that really, we expect gross margin to expand -- the expansion continues to improve throughout the year. We did do better than we expected in Q1. That's why we raised the full year. From a pricing perspective, as we go through the year, there will likely be less pricing overall. There will be less inflation overall, and productivity kind of ramps up as we go through the year as well. So all those things we think are -- will be tailwind. And to the extent that we overdeliver on gross margin, that's why we put the investment commentary in the release as well. Matt?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. You asked a good question with respect to marketing. As everybody knows, last year, in 2020, our marketing as a percentage of sales was 10%. It was kind of a low point for us. And what contributed to that was all our difficulties with the fill rate, et cetera. And we said, hey, we're going to build that back. We want to get back to 11%. At least, we go halfway there in 2023. And you can see from -- and we had a really good first quarter. We let some of that flow through to EPS on a full year basis. So we took up our estimate from 0% to 4% to 2% to 4%, but we always take a long-term view with the company. So yes, to the extent that we have even better performance in future quarters, it's going to give us an opportunity to go higher than 10.5% as a percent of sales. And whenever we're in a position like this, and it's been a few years since we've been flushed, but there's three destinations. First is going to be growth. So we'll be looking to pay for marketing. Can we go higher than 10.5%. For international, we have a lot of runway there. So one thing we could do there with respect to regulatory, we get a third-party help to help us knock out product registrations that might have been scheduled for next year or the year after. And there's always R&D projects as well that we can allocate to. And then from an efficiency standpoint, we're -- like most companies, we're trying to automate this place. And there are discrete projects we can accelerate to automate some repetitive transaction processing in the company. And also there's always IT investments. And finally, with respect to the environment, we're really focused on our sustainability. So there are projects with respect to sustainability like alternative packaging that we could fast forward as well. So it gives us the degrees of freedom, so we're in a good spot here looking forward for the rest of the year, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy: Yes. I appreciate the comment. If I can just get one more, Matt. Just on -- and for Rick as well. HERO seems to be performing much better, I think maybe than folks had modeled, how is it coming in relative to your own expectations? Presumably better, I would think. And why is that? Is the distribution ramp more quickly? Is the velocity been better? Is it both and sort of why? And then maybe just updated thoughts on your outlook for the brand. And I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Richard Dierker: Yes, I'll give you a couple of comments, Kevin. It's Rick. I think both is the answer. Velocities are even better than we expected. And I think distribution gains and TDPs are even better than we expected, faster than we expected. I think in the -- maybe Matt script, he commented about TDPs for HERO and we're 50% higher since we bought the business already...
Operator: [Operator Instructions] For the next question, it comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Chris, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.
ChrisCarey: Hi, good morning. And sorry about the technical difficulties there in the last question. So I just wanted to ask about personal care business. Clearly, we're continuing to see a little bit of sequential improvement. I guess, can you just comment on your visibility on this business relative to even a few months ago? And also just what you're seeing from a kind of gap between what we can consumption data, which remains stronger relative to what you're actually delivering from an organic sales standpoint. Just any visibility on when you think your organic sales will start to look a little bit more than like what we see in the consumption data, which is a little bit better. Thanks so much.
Operator: Yes, I can hear you. By the way, we lost Chris' line at this time. Should we move on to the next caller? No, we're still live and your line is still open. All right. I'll just go ahead and check here. Yes. By the way, I'm -- we'll talk over the audio. Yes, sure. I'll just try to stop the stream for now then, let's see if that would refresh the connection. Okay. All right. So good day, ladies and gentlemen. Apologies for the technical difficulties. So we're going to be resuming with a Q&A. [Operator Instructions] So for your next question, it comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman.
Lauren Lieberman: Hello. Okay. I feel like we were in, myself to the fact that we're live again. Okay. Hi. So let me just -- okay, go back to my questions. So I guess consumer domestic was like, let's call it, 500 basis. It was much stronger than what we saw in Nielsen. So I'm just kind of curious what drove that? Kind of anything you can talk to us about untracked channels. Is there any rebuilding of retailer inventory? I know, Rick, you called out the 1 point on HERO and THERABREATH. But I was just curious, anything else, just helpful to know about on track. Thanks. Hello?
Operator: Hi Lauren, just wanted to take if you can hear me. This is the operator.
Lauren Lieberman: I can hear you.
Operator: Okay.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Now I'm being told -- okay, some people are messaging me that they can hear me, but not here, the company.
Operator: Okay. So for -- okay, so for Mr. Farrell, Mr. Dierker, please try to redial. Just please try to dial back in. Okay. Sounds good. So Lauren, please standby. I'm really sorry about the technical difficulty at this time.
Richard Dierker: Hello? Hello?
Operator: Yes, this is Kyle. I can hear you.
Richard Dierker: Okay. Well, this is our cellphone. Now we're on this way.
Lauren Lieberman: Rick, it's Lauren. I can hear you.
Operator: Yes, can I -- to the call now?
Richard Dierker: All right. Well, hey, take 3.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Did you catch my question or no? Because I can repeat it if you need me to?
Richard Dierker: Yes. No, I got it. I think everybody -- the question was really, how does consumption match up with organic for domestic?
Lauren Lieberman: Yes. And just particularly untracked, right? Just curious about untracked channels.
Richard Dierker: Yes, yes. We don't think there's a huge disconnect actually. We -- IRI consumption is 7%. That included some of the HERO consumption. And so that got -- if you back that out, that's around 6%. So 6% is what IRI would say is our organic consumption. And we were at 5.5%. And the drag is, as you would say, it's from untracked channels like WATERPIK, for example, online or other businesses. So with the disconnect, it's a little bit closer.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. And there was just the -- you called out there was a 1 point benefit to total company from pipeline on HERO and THERABREATH when -- which is small. But when you look at the second half of the year, I know you've talked about improving volume and volume now being up to the total company for the full year. I was curious on any updated thoughts on what you've deemed the more kind of discretionary categories and how you're thinking about shipments for WATERPIK, vitamins as we go through the year?
Richard Dierker: Yes. And I partially thought I was answering that when I answered Chris' question. I probably got cut off. So in 2022, those three businesses, we said in the release, at the end of 2022, they were about a 4% drag for the three businesses. In Q1, they were closer to 3% drag. And I said we expect personal care organic to inflect positively in the back half. And a big reason is because those businesses are not a drag. And furthermore, Matt said it in his script, but it was very encouraging that WATERPIK and vitamins hit their internal plan numbers.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. So you expect them -- those businesses in particular for volumes to be up in the second half? Or not calling that yet and don't need to?
Richard Dierker: I wouldn't call that yet. I would just say we don't expect it to be a drag in the back half.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Got you. I will pass it to anyone that's dialed in, and we can hear. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] For your next question, it comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you also hear me right now?
Matthew Farrell: We can hear you.
Rupesh Parikh: So I guess just continuing on just vitamins. Just curious what you're seeing right now in the category. And I believe your fill rates have now improved in vitamins. Just curious if you're starting to see progress on the share front.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. The vitamin fill rate is improving sequentially month by month take November, December, January, February, March, which is a really good thing. As far as the category goes, if you look at the last few categories for gummies, you may remember in the third quarter last year, a big decline to gummies were at 8%. But then Q4 was down 10% and Q1 down, 2.3%. So I would say it's really stabilized, which is a good thing for us. Now we did lose share in the first quarter, again due to our fill rate difficulties. But we anticipated some of that. And we probably benefited a bit because the category was stronger than we expected. So consequently, the vitamin business wasn't a drag on our outlook. They hit their plan for the first quarter. And we think things should improve from here for the rest of the year.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So I know at the Analyst Day, you gave expectations for organic growth expectations by segment. So it appears at least consumer domestic, a stronger international story or maybe specialty products is weaker. So just curious if you have updated views on expectations by segment for the year.
Richard Dierker: Yes, sure, Rupesh, it's Rick. Domestically, we're now calling 3% to 4%. International between 5% and 7%. SPD is actually slightly negative and that gets us to the total company organically of 3% to 4%.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
Richard Dierker: Okay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] For your next question, it comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Olivia, your line is open. Please ask your question.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to get a little bit of an update on your view on the U.S. consumer, particularly any early reads on the incremental pricing you took, impact of compaction and the extent that you've seen any change in promotional levels? Thank you.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. That's a broad question, Olivia. I'll talk about the U.S. consumer. Look, we're all reading the same data. The U.S. unemployment remains low, although it's clear that job growth is slowing. And the -- also, stats will suggest that the growth -- the year-over-year growth of household income is also decelerating. And I guess the other thing we have coming ahead is student loan payments resume late summer. I think that may not be a big deal, but 40% of millennials and 25% of Gen X consumers have student loan debt. And I think the combination of all that is contributing to consumers being so -- intense and trade down from premium to value. What was your second question, Olivia, your second part?
Olivia Tong: Sorry, it was around compaction, the pricing, any early reads on those and...
Matthew Farrell: Yes, the elasticity and -- yes, we've been taking price for the past couple of years. In some cases, we've taken it 2x or 3x depending on the category like litter or laundry detergent. So the gaps -- the price gaps between brands are actually largely similar to they were pre-COVID. And so I would say that there's no story there right now.
Richard Dierker: Yes. And it's kind of early to call any impact from concentration that just rolled out late Q1, but we expect that will be positive.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And for your next question, it comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara, your line is open. Please ask your question.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. Good morning. So clearly, a strong Q1 that was better than you expected. The guidance for Q2 look favorable relative to consensus also. Just trying to understand, if you look at work sales and EPS, you didn't necessarily fully flow through the upside in the quarter to the full year. Obviously, a full year raise, but more modest. So just help us understand that there are some specific limiting factors there? Or is it more just the reinvestment you talked about earlier? Conservatism in a volatile environment? And particularly on org sales, the questions on org sales and earnings, but org sales, you're not assuming a sequential acceleration in the back half despite easier comps. So I just wanted to understand that relative to the first half expectations. Thanks.
Matthew Farrell: I think you answered the question for me, Dara. We're three months into the - and we follow a lot of companies. And so we're not alone and having a good first quarter but not necessarily falling along through just because there's always a certainty with respect to the economy. So that has [technical difficulty]. So we do have the freedom now to take a long view and increase our marketing from 10.5% higher. And we have all of the place where we can put money, which I went through with Kevin, growth, efficiency or sustainability projects. They're all available to us. So yes, we feel like we got a lot of flexibility going forward for the rest of the year.
Richard Dierker: Yes. And it's very rare that if you look back at our history that we've ever raised after one quarter. Typically, we talk about that in the second quarter. So this is a bit of a positive.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. That's very helpful. And then can you just give us a little more detail on some of the problem areas recently, WATERPIK, FLAWLESS, vitamins, just sequential performance in Q1 relative to recent trend. I know you mentioned a couple of them, you were on plan. But I just wanted to get a little more detail on sort of the year-over-year performance, both in terms of consumer demand as well as retailer inventory levels. If you can just give us a little more insight there. Thanks.
Matthew Farrell: Yes, I'll give some insight on WATERPIK. So as I said, we're happy with the progress in WATERPIK. They hit their internal number. So not a drag on our outlook. But the economy is affecting consumer behavior. Consumers are either not buying or trading down to lower-cost flossers. On the push side, our lunch and lunch are back to normal with the high-volume dental offices. And of course, that's very important to recommendations for first purchases of water flossers. But I would say we're -- we went into the year saying it's going to be a little choppy the first six months, and I think that the comps will get easier in the second half. And vitamins -- on the vitamin side as well, the category performed better than expected. It was only down 2% in the first quarter. And as I said, our fill rates have improved monthly so that now we're getting into the high 80s. And so it's one of the drags on our total company fill rate. And as that progresses, we're going to be in a better position to win back share.
Richard Dierker: Yes. So those two are stabilized and -- expectations. The third one is FLAWLESS. Retail inventories are moving slower than we expected. That's partly have an impact on our inventory reserves for -- limiting inventory on our end, but we think we've appropriately captured that from here, and we're moving forward.
Dara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: And for your next question, it comes from the line of Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Anna, your line is open. Please ask your question.
Anna Lizzul: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I'm curious around volumes. Volumes were flat in the quarter, and you're now expecting volume to be positive overall for Q2 and the full year. You've commented previously on economization on volume expected in certain categories such as laundry, litter and toothpaste. So I was wondering if you're seeing a reversal in that from consumers to maybe are more accepting of price increases or just more benefit from trade down versus economization?
Richard Dierker: Yes, I'll start and then Matt probably has a point or two to add to. What we said on volumes, and just to be super clear, was they were flat in Q1, and we expect to inflect positively in the second half and for the full year. So you can infer that, that means we think they're going to be negative in Q2. Originally, our outlook was down in Q1, down in Q2 and inflect positively in the back half. So we're encouraged by what happened in Q1. That was largely because that was our largest year-over-year delta in case fill. A year ago, Q1 case fill was 72%. Q2 is 89%. So we just have less volume to make up there. Yes. So I would probably say volumes continue to impact -- inflect positively in the back half. We're now calling going to be positive for the year. And that's kind of the short story.
Matthew Farrell: And the only thing I would add to that is that we were out of the gate early in some of our categories with respect to pricing. And so consequently, the passage of time, pricing is going to have less of an impact on us and volume, greater. So we think that the flat line is a great story for the company, and expecting positive volumes for the year, again, this is typically what investors expect from us.
Anna Lizzul: Great. And then just in terms of pricing and margins, just curious how would you attribute the benefit to outright pricing versus the package size changes?
Richard Dierker: Yes. We haven't -- it all gets bundled into that price/volume mix on the gross margin bridge. And so our outlook in February was 180 basis point tailwind. It still is that in April, 180 basis point tailwind from price/volume mix. And that would have, for example, the litter list price increase, but it would also have pack size changes that are happening. It would have -- at times, it would have the laundry concentration benefit in there. So it's a mix. We don't break them out any more independently than that.
Anna Lizzul: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And for your next question, it comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist. Bill, your line is open. Please ask your question.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Matt, just a little bit more on kind of your commentary about consumer trade down. And I'm just trying to understand how you feel like why you think it's consumer trade down as you're benefiting versus just the power of the ARM & HAMMER brand because -- especially in laundry detergent, I mean, for years, you've been taking share from kind of the smaller old Unilever fund, whatever their -- whoever owns them now brands. You're looking at a lot of the stores and a lot of those brands have lost some or all of their shelf space and you gained shelf space. So I'm trying to understand like what you're seeing that -- where you think it's trade-down benefit versus just power of the brand benefit that isn't sustainable regardless of what the economy does?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, look, it's a combination of both. Yes, the ARM & HAMMER brand is a very powerful brand. We got a $5.4 billion of sales. $2 billion of it is ARM & HAMMER. So we're able to advertise ARM & HAMMER across lots of different categories. But when we look at the macro numbers, just look at value laundry detergent grew 9% while premium laundry detergent declined 3%. That's in the category, all brands, premium, all brands, value. So it's clearly happening. That's our biggest category. And then when we look at litter, we see the same thing. We have a black box, which is our premium cat litter. And we've got a yellow box, which serves our value cat litter. And we see these consumers have traded down within the category from the black box to the yellow box. But that's where you have the power of the brand, where people stick with ARM & HAMMER as opposed to move over to a different brand. So I'd say it's probably a combination of both, Bill.
Bill Chappell: Well, and I guess just to follow up on that. Are you seeing outsized or accelerating growth for the extra brand or for that deep value or more shelf space for the -- being given by retailers for the deep value?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, yes. No, that's a good one. We said 8 out of 14 brands that gained share in the quarter. We were almost at nine. We just missed it by hair with Extra. And I would say in recent weeks, Extra has shown a lot of strength. So we think that, that one could turn positive for us as a share grower in future quarters. That's more evidence of trade down, right, Extra - catching fire.
Operator: And for your next question, it comes from the line of Peter Grom from UBS. Peter, your line is open. Please ask your question.
Peter Grom: Thanks Operator. And, good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to get some perspective on what you're seeing from an input cost perspective, kind of building on Kevin's earlier question. Can you maybe just help us understand where you're seeing costs moderate? Where you're seeing costs be stickier? And Rick, I know you previously mentioned that you were less hedged on commodities than you typically would be heading into this year. So to the extent that commodities continue to moderate, how quickly could we see that benefit flowing through? Thanks.
Richard Dierker: Yes. Okay. Thanks, Peter, for the question. In the release, we said that largely for us and our inflation expectations were unchanged. And there's puts and takes on the commodity side. Transportation costs are down. Our resin, the outlook is slightly higher. Soda-ash is higher. Sugar is higher. Some resins are down. Ethylene is down. So it's a mixed bag, but it kind of nets to kind of neutral from our original outlook. You're right, we did say at the beginning of the year that we were less hedged this year than we have in many years, just thinking that commodities would come down over time as the recession was potentially looming. And it just takes a few months for costs to actually be down and stay down before you start seeing those commodities trickling to material pricing, and tickle into -- and then you have to buy and they go on the balance sheet. They get expensed to the P&L when you sell it. So I don't know. If you see something down now, it has to be down for a few months and then probably within six months, it would flow to the P&L.
Peter Grom: That's super helpful. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And your next question, it comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea, your line is open. Please ask your question.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to just -- one is a clarification. The other one is a real question. One on the whole pricing and mix dynamics and volume. Understandably, you have these dynamics in the second quarter. You've got a help in the first quarter. But the second quarter -- the second half, sorry, as you imply, the new guide and do you still have some pricing to come through? And I understand your lap as everybody else, the pricing that you've put in. But you're putting in some pricing even towards the end of last year and beginning of this year. So was just trying to reconcile should we expect in the second half implied in price/mix in your new guide? And then on -- the real question is on the ARM & HAMMER share gains, which obviously have been remarkable. Just wondering on liquid. Your biggest competitor also reduced some price points that were, I think, more sticker shock to some consumers. Have you seen that changed these dynamics as you exit the quarter? Or you continue to gain share in ARM & HAMMER channels? Thank you.
Richard Dierker: Yes, I'll take the -- just the first half, second half dynamics of pricing. But Matt's comment is true, a lot of pricing does roll over. But the first half average, we think, is in the 160s. And the second half we think is 180, 190. So the full year is 180. So we do think there's a little bit, and that's really because of our litter price increase in February, and the concentration impact that kind of flows through there as well. So those are the two things that help in the back half a little bit.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And with respect to pricing, obviously, we do watch what happens and what our competitors do in all of our categories. But with respect to any recent price increases, not just in laundry, but elsewhere, it would be too early to tell. We needed a quarter or two before we can comment on it. What I will add though is that -- and I think Olivia might ask this question earlier, our friends sold on deal. So if you look at liquid laundry detergent and look at it a year ago, the sold-on deal was 31%. And if you look at where it is today, Q1 2023, 31.7%. So another big change year-over-year in promotions. And even sequentially, Q4 was 32% and Q1, 31.7%. So things are pretty stable in the liquid laundry. It's a different story in cat litter. Cat litter, a year ago, sold on deal was 10.7%. And first quarter this year was 14.9%. So it's been kind of a stair step up quarter-by-quarter over the last five quarters. In fact, Q4 was 13.9%. So it's up another 100 bps. And historically, and we've talked about this on previous calls, the litter sold-on deal is typically much higher in the high teens, 18%, 19%, 20%. And I guess the other promotional category would be vitamins. And last year, was 38.9%. Sold-on deal in Q1 this year is 38.5%. So I think that gives you a little bit more color on what's going on with respect to pricing and promotions.
Andrea Teixeira: But do you expect promo to continue to accelerate as we go? I mean I appreciate it's backward-looking, but forward-looking, you're embedding that, obviously, cat litter will be one and perhaps vitamins or you think that this is going to be a similar dynamic?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. No, but Andrea, we would never telegraph our plans. But typically, we're going to react to competition when it comes to trade.
Richard Dierker: Yes. And I would just say, laundry for Q1, a little lot like Q4 from a promotional perspective like that was going through.
Andrea Teixeira: And just -- I'm sorry, just a clarification, the 180, 190 is the -- that you mentioned on the pricing front, that's on top of -- that's what the incremental pricing would come from those two price increases that you mentioned, right?
Richard Dierker: Well, that's for the full year. So there's also partial pricing finishing from last year when we took it midyear, that would be a benefit and a tailwind as well. And that's price/volume mix is that line on break out the three. So that's also volume growth of higher-margin brands, as an example, year-over-year. So there's a lot in that number, but I guess the answer for you, Andrea, is it's a tailwind and the tailwind gets a little bit better in the second half.
Andrea Teixeira: So you should say like all sudden and according -- I mean, if my math is right, you're going to have a second half with pricing of about 2%, 2-ish. That's what comes out with your guide, if that makes sense?
Richard Dierker: Yes, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that, that 180 basis points is also following the mix that is not just priced by itself.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay. Perfect. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And for the next question, it comes from the line of Javier Escalante from Evercore. Javier, your line is open. Please ask your question.
Javier Escalante: Good morning, everyone. And hopefully, you can hear me. I would like to double-click on the ever -- in the greater degree of conservatism built in guidance and what we're going to see in tracked channels. So one is you have positive volumes in the second half despite of compaction in detergents. Is it -- are we going to see a gap between tracked channels and what you report because you correct for wash loads? On HERO, doing very well. Do upsized trigger impact -- higher impact of restricted stock? And thirdly, on the marketing investment, do you -- have you built any sales lift in the second half or just basically investment for the longer term? Thank you.
Richard Dierker: Yes. I'll take the first two and maybe Matt has the third one. But -- and I'll even take your second one first. Through RSUs for HERO, our adjusted EPS excludes any impact of amortization related to RSUs. So that's kind of not a factor in our outlook or in our adjusted EPS. So that's apples-to-apples. Number one, we don't expect to see much of a gap between shipments and consumption at all. And when you see tracked versus our -- or Nielsen or consumption versus our organic growth in the back half, it should be really close, is the short answer. And in Q2, you may see a little bit of a disconnect again because some of those brands like WATERPIK, as they continue to stabilize and go backwards a little bit, that's largely in untracked channels. Some of HERO growth from a reported perspective is also in untracked channels, whether it's online or a few specialty retailers. So I would say, overall, we've kind of talked about -- we had a great quarter. We're raising the full year on reported organic EPS across the board. We've made the comment that we're going to make investments if we continue to outperform on revenue and profits. And Matt?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. As far as marketing goes, we're -- what we have in our forecast is we're modeling 10.5%. But if you look at what our -- what happened in the first quarter, first quarter, we're up 70 bps. And we said for the full year, we'd be up 50 bps. So our track record so far is as we get into a quarter. And to the extent we have the same experience we've had in Q1 in Q2, then we have the opportunity to take it up again more than 50 bps. But it's going to be pay-as-you-go.
Javier Escalante: And if I can follow up on the detergent side because perhaps I didn't explain myself is that when you compact, don't you have a negative impact on volume? Or does your reporting basically adjust for wash loads, something that we cannot see in IRI track channels?
Richard Dierker: Yes. These compaction levels are not to the extent that happened five years ago, 10 years ago, when we were doing 100% compaction. They are a lot more marginal. Round one happened a year ago. This is round two for us. And they just -- we don't anticipate them throwing volumes or price off in a major way.
Javier Escalante: Thank you very much.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. I think that was the last question. We're going to wrap it up right now. We'll talk to you at the end of the second quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-03 13:00:00) =====
Matthew Farrell: I'll call everybody to attention. Hey, we haven't been together for a few years. The last number were down here was January of 2020. So it's been three years. It's really great to see so many familiar faces in the room. We've got a great show for you today. I'm going to start off with the safe harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read that when you have some time. And here's who is here from management today, which have virtually the entire management team. So when we're done with the presentation, everybody will come on up, fill the stage, and then we can do Q&A. All right. We've got a pretty packed agenda. Some of it will be familiar to you, but these are all the things we think we want you to walk out of the room knowing more than when you walked in the room. All right. So, I want to start with a look back at 2022. So, as you all know, we had significant inflation this past year. We had $250 million of increases in COGS year-over-year '22 versus '21.  And how we reacted to that, we increased prices both in '21 and in '22. And in some cases, we raised prices more than once. You saw that in laundry and also on litter. We have really great success this year with several of our brands. As you can see on the page here, ARM & HAMMER litter laundry detergent and BATISTE at all-time highs, racked shares.  And then if you look at some of our more recent acquisitions, and that would be ZICAM THERABREATH and HERO acquired in 2020, '21 and '22, all had double-digit growth and all-time high market shares. And then finally, we know we've experienced a black swan event over the past few years. We know there'll be others in the future. So, we've done a lot of work in '21 and '22, spent a lot of money, a lot of effort getting ready for the next one. And then finally, we ended the year strong. So, what you see on the slide here that the categories that we're in grew consumption, 13 out of 17. And just as kind of a leave behind, these are the 17 categories that we compete in. So, you can take a look at this after class is which categories went up and which categories did not.  All right. Now here's a slide that we show every year, and this is a very different slide than we've seen in the 16 years that I've been with Church & Dwight. So, the first 15 years with Church & Dwight -- every year, we've had significant TSR. And in many, many years, it's been double digit. And this year, we went backwards.  And that's a disappointment to me, it's a disappointment to the management team, to the Board and our shareholders. And so, granted, we have that disappointment. But now we're just going to broom ourselves off, take our sows up. We got a great company. We've got great brands, and we're looking ahead with optimism to ‘23 and we plan on starting another 15-year streak starting in 2023. All right. So why do we have so much confidence in our future. First off, we'll go left to right U.S. So, Barry is going to come up in a little while and talk about our plans for the U.S. business and why we expect growth in the future. Mike Reid is going to come up and talk to us about international for a long time. International has been growing at 6% annually. That, by the way, is our model. And he's going to tell you why we believe that to continue in the future.  Innovation as well, Barry is going to talk about innovation. We're a very innovative company. It's been a big contributor to our top line growth for many, many years. And Barry is going to take you through one innovation, in particular, which is hard ball new leader that we're launching this year, we think could transform the litter category. Surabhi going to come up. She's our Chief Digital Officer. He's going to talk about how Digitally savvy we've become on our plans for the future. And finally, the Evergreen model. everybody in the room, particularly long-term holders. We're very familiar with our evergreen model, 3% top line, 8% bottom line growth. That model is healthy long term. We have strong fundamentals in 2023, we think we'll return to that model in 2024. All right. So now who we are. So, we're a $5.4 billion company. You can see how we split. We're largely a U.S. business, 77% domestic, 70% International and our Specialty Products business, which is our legacy business is a business that the company was founded on, it's about 6% today.  So, we have 14 power brands. Those 14 power brands make up 85% of our revenues and profits. One brand you won't see up there today is flawless. That's a business that we bought four years ago. It obviously didn't turn out the way we had expected as disclosed in the release. But as I said, these 14 power brands drive 85% of our revenues and profits.  So, here's our formula. We have a balanced and diversified portfolio. I'll take you through some stats in a minute. We have low private label exposure. The weighted average exposure is 12%. And innovation, Barre, is going to take you through a little while, and we are an acquisitive company. We generate lots and lots of cash and the first destination for our cash is a TSR accretive acquisition.  So, here's some of the diversity stats I want to share with you. So, we're 40% value, 60% premium. For as household and personal care split, it's about even 46% household, 48% personal care. And here's our weighted average private label exposure. And this is over a long period of time. It's generally around 12%. That really hasn't changed that much recently.  There are the five categories that we're most exposed to. You can see on the chart there, see how the private level has moved up and down over time. But it's generally stable even in this environment. And as far as consistent innovation, this is the lineup a lot of the new products we're going to be launching in 2022. The upper left, you see hard ball. I think you're really going to be excited about that when you hear about it later today. All right. We have a long history of growth through acquisitions. If you look at -- go back 2004, $1.5 billion. We've added almost $4 billion to our top line, and a lot of that is through acquisitions. You can see they're all laid out through the bottom. Almost every year, we add a new brand. And in the year 2000, the only brand we had was ARM & HAMMER.  So, with 13 of our 14 power brands have acquired -- been acquired since the beginning of the century. And most of those brands are number one and number two in their category. And we have very clear acquisition criteria. Got to be number one or number two in their categories. Notably, they need to be high-growth and high-margin brands that are fast- moving consumables.  We've added fast-moving consumables because of our experience with FLAWLESS. Asset-light -- so we're a company that doesn't invest a whole lot in plants. We like to buy businesses that are already made by third parties, by co-packers. And we like to be able to leverage our considerable supply chain. And then finally, it needs to have a long-term competitive advantage. All right. So, the short story is, we have 14 brands today. We hope to have 20 tomorrow. All right. And I think that's it for me. I'm going to pass it over to Rick.
Richard Dierker: All right. Thanks, Matt. So, we're going to go through quite a few things, Evergreen model, how we finished 2022. We're talking about 2023, and we'll also talk about capital allocation and cash flow. So first off, this is how we begin and end most presentations. This is our organic evergreen model. So, we start off with 3% of sales growth. We have gross margin expansion of 25 basis points. We have marketing that's usually flat on a percent of sales but higher dollars. We leverage SG&A to get to 50 basis points, and then we expand EPS by about 8%. That is our long-term algorithm.  So, in Q4, what happened. So, in Q4, we had a better-than-expected quarter. We were 300 basis points better on reported sales. Half of that was organic. Half of that was a little bit of FX and then the HERO acquisition did better than expected. So, thumbs up on reported sales growth thumbs up on organic sales growth. Gross margin was a contraction. That's what we expected. And we've stair-stepped better throughout the entire year in 2022, and we expect that to continue in 2023.  Adjusted EPS was $0.62 at the high end of our range, and then cash from operations, I'll talk about on the full year, but we significantly beat our cash flow projections as well. For the full year, we came in around 3.5% reported sales growth versus 3%, about 1.5% versus 1% on organic, and then gross margin was way down. And you heard Matt say, $250 million of year-over- year inflation was the driver behind that.  Adjusted EPS was $2.97, high end of the range. And then reported EPS was down 49% or $1.68 and that was really the flawless noncash impairment. And then cash from operations was $885 million versus our outlook of $800 million, and that's really strong cash earnings and improved working capital, primarily inventories were coming down back in line especially for our discretionary businesses, which was good to see. Okay. Moving to 2023. So, we try to simplify the outlook. We have the detailed outlook on the next page, but this is a chance just to take a step back and say, how are we doing. Our outlook is 0% to 4% the midpoint is 2% EPS growth. Before we get into the investments on marketing, SG&A and the impacts below the line, our core adjusted EPS growth is 10%, double digit.  So, we're really pleased with how strong the business is performing. We've chosen to make investments in brands and people. And so, we're increasing our marketing spend up to 10.5% of sales, and that's about a $30 million investment or a 3% drag on EPS. Incentive comp normalization, and we didn't have a very good incentive comp year this year, back to par is about $30 million or so, and that's another 3% drag.  And then interest and taxes is a 2% drag. Here is a detail of the financial outlook. So, 5% to 7% reported sales growth, 2% to 4% reported -- 2% to 4% organic sales growth that 300-basis point difference is largely the HERO acquisition. The detail for organic is for the divisions is 2% to 3% for the domestic division, 3% to 5% for international and SPD at 5% to 6%.  Gross margin for the first time in a long time expands by 100 to 120 basis points. That is exciting for us, right? We've had a stair step down over the last few years. This is a road to recovery, and we'll get into the details in a minute. Marketing that's the investment I talked about. SG&A is higher, and we'll talk through that. Operating margin is flat. And then other expense, we're calling out as a drag of $110 million. We're $35 million higher on interest expense next year because of hero debt, and we have some variable debt that has rates going up. Effective tax rate is 23%, and then the EPS growth is 0% to 4% and cash is strong, up 5% or so to $925 million. Here's a track record of reported sales growth. I don't think we've shown this slide before. We usually just show organic, but we thought we'd show both. So, over the last 10 years, we've averaged 6% and of reported sales growth. And in 2023, we expect no different 5% to 7%. Organically, here's the 10-year track record. Our average is around 4%. Our organic model -- Evergreen model is 3%, and our range in 2023 is 2% to 4%.  Now one of the most important things about organic sales growth is how you get it. And I'd say if you look back at the last eight to 10 years, most of our growth is volume growth. Historically, our Everbridge model was 3%, then we would have 3% volume growth and pretty much flat on pricing. 2022 is a little bit of an aberration, all the pricing that's happening all over the industry because of all the inflation that's happening all over the industry. But you can see in Q3 of 2022, we had really the low point for volume growth.  And we have improvement in Q4. We have further improvement, although negative in Q1, further improvement, although negative in Q2, and then we inflect positively in the back half of 2023 is the expectation. Now moving to gross margin. So, 100 and 120 basis points. Why do we believe that we can expand? Inflation is moderating. We still have inflation, it's just moderating. Productivity programs are doing well. margin-accretive acquisition, that's CRO, and we're improving our case fill in a big way. So, you can see that 41.9% goes to around at the midpoint, 43% and if you look at the track record, 45% is kind of where we were. And so, we have room to run over the next few years.  And here's the detailed gross margin. This is the bridge in 2022, we were down 170 basis points, and there is a massive headwind because of inflation. In 2023, we think yes, we still have inflation down 240 basis points, but price volume mix, plus productivity offset inflation for the first time in a long time, and then we have help from our acquisition. So that's how we're up 110 basis points year-over-year. On marketing, so a similar story. We have full year marketing support. We have better product supply. We're going to get to 2.5%. If you do the simple math, and look at our high-water mark back in 2020, it was around 12%. Now remember, we took price these last three years, and we don't raise marketing dollars just because we -- the price of the widget went up. So, 12.1%, effectively, if you strip out the price increases is around 10.7%.  So, between 10.5% and 11% is equivalent to that 12%. So, by stair stepping up to 10.5%, we really feel good about the support we have for the brands. SG&A is higher, and it's higher for a few reasons. HERO has stand-alone SG&A. That business is off and running and doing a great job, $30 million of normalization for incentive comp and equity. And then number three, I also want to leave this group with our long-term evergreen leverage targets remain in place. We have a stair step up in one year, but the behavior doesn't change going forward.  And we've had consistent strong adjusted EPS growth, low double or high single-digit growth for a long time is the track record. Last year, we took a step back down 1.5%, but we're taking a step forward this year in 2023, and we expect that to have further steps forward as we move along.  There is a first half, second half story. First half EPS is expect them to be down. Why? Because we had continued choppiness of our discretionary brands. We've kind of telegraphed that last quarter. We said for the next six months or so, we have continued happiness for those discretionary businesses like water pickles and even vitamins as we're lapping Omicron impacts.  International supply challenges return to normal promotional levels and higher marketing dollars, have higher marketing spend year-over-year in the first half than the second half. And then the second half is impacted by improved productivity, improved global supply. We have volume growth. That was that chart I showed you earlier.  Moving on to cash flow. Our free cash flow conversion for many, many years has been industry leading, on average, around 120%. And this past year, we're around 97%. Why is that? Because of the CapEx investment we're making in capacity, laundry, litter vitamins. And then in 2023, we'll also expect free cash flow conversion to be in the 90s.  How do we generate cash? Well, part of it is how we manage working capital. We've got from 52 days cash conversion cycle all the way down to 19 days. So overall, just extremely happy on how we've leveraged our balance sheet and improved our working capital.  We took a stair step up in 2022 because we had elevated levels of inventory, primarily for our discretionary businesses. But as I -- as you heard in the Q4 release, we've improved those inventories. We still have more room to go, but we've improved those inventories.  And then we have a really strong balance sheet. So, we ended the year at 2.1 times in 2022, and we're going to -- we expect to end the year at 1.7 times. So, we have plenty of firepower to do an incremental dealer deals. We have enough room to go up to $3.2 billion of a deal and stay and maintain our investment-grade rating. Okay. Just talking about capital allocation. Number one, we always talk about TSR, accretive M&A. We want to do the HERO deal. We want to do the THERABREATH deal again and again and again, those businesses are great. Those are the fast-moving consumer goods that we're focused on that Matt just mentioned. CapEx organic growth. We'll talk more about that in a minute, NPD, debt reduction and return of cash to shareholders.  So, this is the capacity slide. laundry, litter, baking sorter vitamins, all have capacity projects in place, technology, sustainability, all those things help drive our organic growth. But overall, we're not a capital-intensive company. Look at a long track record for Church & Dwight. We're around 2% of sales. And in 2022, we took a step up to 3.3% as we started the investment cycle for laundry, litter and vitamins. In 2023, we'll be around 4%, 4.5%. And then in 2024, we expect to stay a step down and then in 2025, we return to historical levels. That's our expectation.  And then finally, our dividend increase, right? We had a 0% to 4% EPS outlook, and this is the high end of the range. We've been paying a dividend for many, many years, 122 consecutive years.  And then finally, I'd like to turn it over to Barry, who's going to talk through MPD and how the U.S. consumer business is doing.
Barry Bruno: Thanks, Rick. Everybody, good afternoon. Nice to be back live with you here. I'm Barry Bruno. I lead our U.S. business, and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about our categories, our brands, a little bit about innovation and then a new marketing campaign. We call it give it the HAMMER. You might have noticed that when you walked in as we've wrapped the building in Orange today. So pretty good work there that I hope you like as much as we do.  I may be biased as I lead the U.S. business, but I think our future is pretty bright. We're leaders in growing categories. I'll show you deeper what's going on in those categories in just a little bit, but we're number one or number two player in categories which are growing and healthy.  We thrive in difficult environments. We've been through a lot over our 150-plus-year history and we thrive in those environments. We bring more consumers in. They stick with us as we emerge from them. And our acquisitions have a lot of room to run. I'm going to talk with you a little bit about ZICAM, a little bit about THERABREATH and about HERO.  When I say that we're leaders in healthy growing categories, you can see what's going on here. Green means the category grew in that year, read, it contracted. You can see we've added a few new categories over the years as we bought brands in the cold shortening, mouthwash and acne patch categories, but healthy growth across each of those 6.4% weighted average last year. We also know how to hold and grow share, right? seven of 14 last year is not ideally where we want to be. We had supply challenges and a number of them that we -- that held us back from where we'd like to be. Ultimately, we plan to do far better as we go forward as we aspire to be better than seven out of 14.  That's going to happen as our supply chain improves, right? You can see here where we were last year, Q1 below 80% and improving throughout the year. Some of those supply challenges has made share growth difficult. But as we get into the new year ahead, you can see we're at 93%, growing to 97% through the course of the year. That's good not only for us. it's good for our retailers as we bring growth back to these categories where, again, we're the number one or number two player.  And you saw this before, we like difficult environments. We do pretty well in challenging environments. Our portfolio split 40% value, 60% premium, allows us to bring new consumers in, in tough economic times and keep them. And as Matt said about private label, relatively low exposure, only five of 17 categories have material private label. This is a look at consumption in Q4. So, in 13 of 17 categories in Q4, growth took place.  You can see some categories that are new to us. If you look at the top cold shortening, if any of you navigated November, December without a cold, the cough, COVID, RSV, I commend you, many of your fellow compatriots here in the U.S. did not do as well, and you can see what drove category growth there. But what I like about this, categories that we've been in for a long time are growing, new categories are growing as well. So, let's take a look at some of those categories that matter to Church & Dwight. Fabric Care. Left-hand side, category growth, right? You can see category growth was 6%, 7%, moderating a little bit in Q3 when the consumer took a step back. And then you can see what church and with growth was on the right-hand side. So, while we lagged the point in Q1, we grew faster in Q2, 3 times faster than category in Q3 and Q4. And as you all know, when you're growing faster than category, you're gaining share and that led us to an all-time share high, 14.9% as we ended the year.  And I want you to take away, that's part of a long-term trend, right? We were at 11.5% share in 2017. We're at 14.9% now consumers who try ARM & HAMMER, love the brand and stay with us over time. And we think that's only going to happen more in this environment, right? You can see where the consumer is trading down from premium into value, which is where ARM & HAMMER squarely sits and we're keeping those consumers, as you saw in our all-time share hide. Litter is another really important category. I'm going to talk to you about innovation in litter. But right now, let me show you where our existing business is double-digit growth each quarter last year, 14%, 12%, you can see what's going on there. And again, the story of share growth here in tough economic times, we're continuing to gain share. You can see where we've gained a point and change over the year.  But really, what's going on our value orange box, cat litter is gaining material share again, if you look at Q3, Q4, when the consumer was most stressed and they were trying ARM & HAMMER litter they've moved to us and they're sticking with us. So, another story about tough economic times in Church & Dwight persevering.  And it's not just economic times that are tough, cough, cold, flu, again, RSV. We really like the addition of ZICAM to our portfolio. You can see over years on the left-hand side how the category has been moving, took a step back in 2021. But in 2022, as consumers were socializing and going out again masks were going away. The category bounced back and ZICAM share of cold shortening has built strength upon strengthens at a 77 share. And actually, if you look at the far right here, we exited in December a 78 share of the category.  And again, this is an interesting chart on the left, right? That is influenza reports to the CDC just in November and December of 2022 versus the last five years, that gives you a little bit of flavor for how severe the cough, cold season was and flu this year.  So that's good, and those are some important categories. We haven't even really talked about acquisitions yet. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about mouthwash and acne care. As a reminder, we bought THERABREATH in December of 2021. We bought it HERO in October of 2022. So, HERO has only been with us for 90 days. But it's a story of strength to strength and growth.  New distribution for THERABREATH plus our WATERPIK hygienist detailing it and have led to outstanding growth and HERO is on the same path. Let me tell you a little bit more about each of those. So THERABREATH sales on the left here. So, percentage growth year-over-year, you can see where that business was up 59%, 45%, 50%. Ultimately, though, that growth far faster than the category has led us to an 8 share of the overall mouthwash market. We're at almost a 20 share of the alcohol-free mouthwash market category, subcategory, right? We're the number two player there.  We're growing as we're investing more in marketing and advertising and distribution. And speaking of distribution, when we last met with you guys, we talked about the huge runway that THERABREATH had. And you can see we're realizing some of that now up 60%, but we still trail all of our main competitors, Actin CREST and LISTERINE were way under skewed.  And as a brand that retails for double the category average, we're at about a $10 price point versus a $5 average, retailers are happy to engage us with us in those conversations as we bring a lot of penny profit to the category. So, a great track record for THERABREATH breath already, and that's going to continue into the future.  HERO, our newest edition. The Acne pass category almost didn't exist five years ago. You can see $20 million in retail sales in 2018. It has grown dramatically to $340 plus million fueled by HERO. And you can see the percentage growth for HERO on the right-hand side in each month driving that category growth.  And what's remarkable about that, I think HERO was only in distribution in bricks and mortar and Target and Ultra last year, right, on Amazon as well, but only target in Ultra. That's why you can see the TDPs are difficult to calculate even in terms of how small they were. All of that growth is ahead of us as we look to get our fair share and drive more growth, and we're going to be launching in all of the major bricks-and-mortar retailers that you'd expect starting with CVS now and more to come over the course of the year.  So, the summary for that section, right? They're great categories we compete in. They're growing. They're healthy. We're the number one or number two player in most of them. We thrive in difficult environments with the portfolio that's 40% value we bring consumers in and we keep them. And our most recent acquisitions have tons of room to run. And we haven't talked about innovation yet. So, I'm going to spend a little bit of time on that. It might surprise you, I'm going to focus on cat litter. Because I think we've got something really noteworthy that our R&D group has created for us. The category, just to give you a look back, we started with our orange box products going back to 1998. We added Black Box, which is our premium back in 2016. We've had a 12% CAGR over decades in the business.  That value cat litter, $280 million in retail sales, that's Orange box that's one pillar for us. Second pillar, clump and seal, our premium price litter has been 80% incremental to us, and we think we're on the cusp of lasting our third pillar. We call it hard ball or lightweight litter perfected.  Why do we care so much about lightweight later? Well, we've got a 25% share in the total clumping category. We've only got a 5% share in the lightweight category. And lightweight is about a 16% subcategory of the total category. So absolutely going after our fair share there, and we think hard ball is going to help us do it. What is hard ball. It's a new and different kind of litter. It's sorghum, which is a sustainable non-clay lightweight grain. We turn that into virtually indestructible clumps, which makes for easy no mess scoping.  And I could tell you more about it, but I'm going to show you a video of some of our scientists having a little bit of fun that I think will bring it to life. Let's play the video, please. [Audio/Video Presentation] I like the roof drop as the demo, right? That's a compelling one. Hopefully, that gave you a flavor to what hardball is all about. Again, category benefits, it's surprisingly lightweight yet incredibly strong, it's virtually indestructible clumps, makes cleaning the litter box of breeze. If you've had to clean the litter box at home, you know it's probably one of the least favorite household chores and hard ball makes it far, far easier.  And it's sustainable, right? renewable, lightweight, easy to transport as well. So that's only one of our innovations. You can see in the top left corner. We've got innovation across laundry and condoms and acne patches and water flossers and vitamins Nair prep and smooth, by the way, a great new innovation that's going to make facial hair removal, far, far easier. BATISTE, SPINBRUSH and we're going to bring THERABREATH to a whole new generation of mouthwash users as we launch our kids line.  So, lots of innovation across it. Carlos Linares can't be with us here today. He runs R&D and Leslie Dreibelbis here. That team has done a great job giving us as marketers incredible innovation to launch. Trying to tell you just about one more thing. We call it Give it to HAMMER. It's our new master brand campaign for ARM & HAMMER. You see it all around the building.  And I don't know if technically, we're in a recession or not as judged by economist, but I can tell you our consumer, sure feels that we're in a recession. If you look at the top right-hand corner, that consumer is paying $396 a month more for goods this year than they were a year ago. And that's forcing them to make difficult decisions. 53% are making different choices. 90%, as you might imagine, are anxious and stressed about that.  And I grabbed a spot from a consumer that was posted to here before we ever started this campaign, but this is the inspiration. When you worked hard to get a good job, but it doesn't even feel like it mattered. Gas is $5, rent increased by hundreds. Frozen chicken is $25. It's impossible to buy a home and inflation is so high that the Dollar Tree is now the $1.25 tree, right? That's what our consumer is dealing with, and they feel powerless about it.  And it's leading to a wide open window for brand reconsideration. Brands that were on autopilot are now being reconsidered. If you look at the bar chart at the bottom right there, 46% of consumers according to a McKinsey study are shop in different brands and 42% plan to add them to their portfolio going forward.  And we say, ARM & HAMMER is made for this moment, where the hard-working brand is packed with power, price to be accessible to all and eager to help. And we're launching a new campaign, a new video to consumers next week. We're going to share it with you now. Let's play the video. [Audio/Video Presentation] So, we think right message, right brand, right time. We're going to be launching it to consumers on Monday. So, you guys have got a sneak peek here. National TV, digital all the influence and social media you'd expect on e-retail and through PR. We're excited about the campaign. We think it's going to bring a whole new generation of consumers back into ARM & HAMMER and they're going to stick with us after.  So, thank you for your time. I'm going to turn it over to my partner in crime and the leader of all things digital, Surabhi Pokhriyal
Surabhi Pokhriyal: Thank you, Barry. Hi, everyone. So good to see you. flatter to be here, leading digital Church & Dwight. My name is Surabhi Pokhriyal. So, I would say digital acceleration is actually a stated and acted upon priority for us because this is a new section, I'll do a little bit state of the union of what the industry is seeing and then give color on what Church & Dwight is seeing. So, you will notice here, we say 70% of all purchases in the U.S. are going to be digitally influenced by 2027. Just for context, 60% of all sales in 2023 are already digitally influenced. What that means is not just the sales that we do on Amazon, walmart.com, target.com and so on, but sales that are happening in brick-and-mortar because of how the consumer feels inspired to make decision in store using the digital knowledge they have.  So, when you're walking the target aisle and looking up a review on some other retailer, that's what we are calling digitally influenced sales. Similarly, the industry also tells us 81% of U.S. consumers are omnichannel shoppers. That is every channel shopper because the consumer doesn't discriminate online or brick-and-mortar. They just want the right price the right value and the right product. And we know from the industry that consumers that shop both online and in-store have a larger basket size.  One example on online, how the digital shelf changes, this is a gif image of every hour how our results change and how fund you will have volatile online digital shelf is it literally changes by the minute depending on what you're searching and how the results show up. So, we aspire to win on those top five to 10 results, so our brands show up and the consumer needs us. This is one example. We really want to be there where the eyeballs are. So, in the last so many years, as we pivot to digital as our choice of channel to communicate with the consumer, be it social, search, programmatic. We want to make those authentic relatable relationships with the consumers and truly make it more edutainment. So, while we are educating them, we are also entertaining them and not really throwing a media creative out explicitly.  At the same time, the proverbial marketing funnel has so on flattened because the consumer has the right to go from inspiration liking a product, considering to buy it and actually buying it within milliseconds. So, you will notice on the right, we are actually doing campaigns where consumers can go, be inspired about say, OXICLEAN in this case and go buy it at a retailer of choice all from within the creative media. And we see millions of clicks happening that way and flattening the marketing funnel.  Let's talk some numbers. Back in 2016, about six years back, only 2% of our sales were digital, e-commerce sales. We closed 2022 upwards of 16%. Of course, COVID accelerated this behavior because the consumer chose to buy online when they had no other options. But what we are seeing is when the consumer learns a new behavior you cannot take convenience back from them. It becomes a very sticky behavior, and we see sustained post-COVID momentum, and that's how we see digital sales accelerating for us for all our brands.  Saying that we have a digital first ambition actually means that we are pivoting from digital being a capability builder to digital being a business builder. So, we come with the commerce worst mindset. We spend a ton of media in overall marketing and a large part of that is digital media. We also are very cognizant that digital cannot be a function by itself, and we need to elevate all boats and which is why we're investing a ton of effort into training and educating "traditional folks" who may not have a digital responsibility and launching educational programs internally. This is a good example of how in-store and online. We want to make sure that we win with the consumer when she is on her way and doing footfalls in the store. At the same time, we want to make sure our content online is truly thumb stopping. So that we win with her in every single channel. So, in store, you want to be at eye level, easily reachable and have the right adjacency. But online, you want to have the right short-form videos, the product descriptions and so on.  I'll give an example, like online, every keyword is actually an aisle in itself. So, you type a litter, that's your endless aisle. You try in dry shampoo, that's your endless aisle, and we want to win in both of those isles, both in-store and online. Personalization is also a big focus for us. We know that the consumer yearns for a one-to-one kind of connection, and we can no longer serve the same creative to every demographic. So, in this example, a fantastic dry shampoo brand, the #1 in the U.S. and with the largest market share, we saw a ton of consumer engagement and much high purchase intent when we started doing creative, which is the right media, the right messaging for the right hair type.  We also are conscious that digital being such a fast-moving area, we cannot just accelerate what we already do in digital, but also be mindful of what might come at the helm in the future of. On the left, you will see a lot of examples from Dain that is TikTok in China, and you have probably seen many examples of how live streaming is a huge thing in China, and we sold, say, 60,000 bottles BATISTE of but he's in under five minutes.  At the same time, in the Western world, live streaming is a newer concept because it's not meant as much for social commerce as it is meant for social discovery. So, we are partnering with a lot of retailers, Walmart, Amazon included, to see how might live streaming be a bigger concept, and we have experimented a decent amount in this. This keeps us at tip of the spare to make sure we do well, not just what we already do it well in digital, but find newer avenues to scale. Our current marketing spends of all the monies we spend in media, 70% is via digital channels. That is a big jump from -- if you see on the left-hand side, about until 2016, 2017, this number was 35%. So large part of the media used to be print, store and TV, where we just had a few asset types, each campaign. And now like Barry was showing, we have a variety of campaigns, everything from video, OTT, social, influencer retail media, of course, and audio that we are able to reach a variety of consumers with dozens of assets per campaign. So, we are able to personalize the messaging at the cohort level and get better reach, sufficiency and of course, media ROI for that.  All this cannot be done without raising the intellectual capital of the most priced asset in our company, that is our people. We are very committed to raising digital IQ of everybody within the organization and we launched large-scale digital commerce certification programs for not just the people who do digital day in and day out, but the traditional or analog marketers so that nobody will be analog anymore. Everybody has to jump on the digital bandwagon.  I'll quote [indiscernible] quickly here to say I scare to where the puck is going to be and not where it has been. That's exactly the sentiment will live and breathe in terms of digital acceleration in the company, be it consumer insights and analytics where we want to listen to the consumer using their ratings and reviews, consumer sentiment on social and design new product innovation or get back to them with the right solutions beat our acquisitions with digitally savvy brands like HERO and THERABREATH, who do a fantastic job at elevating all boats within the company. And having a one commercial team mindset where digital is truly a center of acceleration for Church & Dwight.  So, with that, I will pass it on to my peer in international, that also see the ton of digital acceleration. So that is Mike Reed.
Michael Read: Thanks, Surabhi. Great to be here. My name is Mike Great. I run the international and the SPD business for Church & Dwight. So, I just want to take the next few minutes to talk about how we're doing in international. And then close with some just updates on our SPD business. So, the international story. So, from the Evergreen model, we're planning to grow 6% organically each year. And just to give you a little bit of a makeup of the business, we're about $900 million in sales, it's basically two different parts. We have our subsidiary markets, which are six. This is a fully staffed, direct models that we have entities we sell directly to retail in Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Australia and Mexico. That's about 65% of our business. The other 35% runs through our Global Markets Group, which we call GMG. That's essentially -- we work with more than 400 partners and distributor partners around the world in over 100 countries.  And then we've actually supported that with five regional offices China, Singapore, Panama, the U.K., and most recently, in Mumbai, India, which we opened in March of 2022. If you look back, we've got a very strong track record of growth against that 6% evergreen model going back to 2015. We did take a little bit of a step back in 2022. We've got really strong demand and orders in the system. We did have some supply challenges we referenced earlier in the presentation. And we did have some drag within our China market largely with some lockdowns and some waterflow contraction. But overall demand is really, really strong, and we've got a really strong track record. If I unpack that a little bit, clearly, China has been a drag. But if you actually look at the -- our six subsidiary markets as well as four out of GMG regions. We have really strong positive growth across the board. Demand is really strong. Our portfolio is performing extremely well. I think as supply chain recoveries and as China starts to recover, we'll be poised to take advantage of that and get back on our evergreen model.  The reason we have confidence in that, I'd say it's threefold. One is just the strength of our brand portfolio. Our brands travel extremely well across the world. can frame it up in three different ways. Traditionally, and certainly a big part of what we do today is we leverage our U.S. power brand. So, ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean, BMS, TROJAN, et cetera. Those brands travel extremely well across the globe. ARM & HAMMER across all segments is our single largest brand and some of those performed extremely well for us.  But those are also complemented with a strong international portfolio in the personal care and OTC space, brands like Sterimar, FemFresh, Gravel are unique brands to the International division, high margin and our high-growth categories, we performed quite strongly there. And of course, we've taken great benefit from our acquisitions that, in many cases, our U.S. based, we're adding their THERABREATH and HERO to the family in 2023. So really excited about those. So, across the portfolio, those are kind of the three ways we look at it, but together, gives us a lot to play with internationally. The second part is geographic expansion. So, while we've got a great international story, we're still very early in our journey. If you look at most of our peer set, most of the revenues are in the 60% range outside of the U.S. We're in that 17% to 18% range. So, we have a long runway to go, lots of geography, lots of brands to go into those geographies. So really excited about the runway ahead.  And thirdly and equally important is we are making some key investments in the International division. So, we continue to invest in e-commerce and digital maturity and growth Similarly, in pricing and revenue management we're adding some supply chain within our Asia community as well as putting infrastructure in people around quality, regulatory, R&D in some of our key emerging markets lay in the APAC region. So overall, a very long runway of growth for international, very strong portfolio of brands. So, it's really a matter of continuing to extend our portfolio into new geographies. We'll continue to leverage our acquisitions. THERABREATH and HERO will become really important brands for the portfolio. Most of our growth will continue to come from our global markets group and within our emerging markets, and we're going to continue to invest in key capabilities and resources as we continue to grow. All right. Let's switch gears to Specialty Products. So, Specialty Products is aimed to grow 5% organically each year. Just to kind of break that down, it's about a $350 million business. It grew almost 4% this year. 2021, we grew at 12%. It's broken up two-third, one-third between Animal Nutrition, which is 69% and Specialty Chemicals at 31%.  The animal productivity is largely prebiotics, probiotics, and food processing safety. It's all under the ARM & HAMMER master brand. So, we have a whole host of product lines in order to service the animal productivity space.  And just if you go back to 2015, international was not a big part of the business. We have made a conservative effort to move into our global markets, not too similar to our consumer business. 2022, it's 12%, and we'll continue to grow our international footprint. But as we grow our international footprint, we're also going into new species as well. So, what used to be largely a dairy business is now cattle, swine and poultry as well. So, diversifying also the specie range.  So, with that, this is probably the last time we'll show this slide. If you go back in history, we often had sort of our dairy business and our own productivity is largely linked to the fluctuations in milk prices. Since we've diversified in terms of our species to include dairy cattle and swine and also are moving internationally, we've been able to smooth out our revenue. So, we won't have the ups and down cyclical effect that we've had in past years.  So, this will be the last time we showed this chart, but I think it's an important context to have much stable revenues moving forward on SPD. So overall, trusted brand from a Church & Dwight, but also ARM & HAMMER umbrella brand, both in the animal nutrition and the specialty chemicals. We're very aligned with kind of key trends around prebiotics, probiotics and available and affordable proteins. We've got a diversified around multiple species, and we're growing internationally. So, for all those reasons, we're pretty excited about where SPD is headed as well as international. So, with that, I will hand back over to Matt Farrell.
Matthew Farrell : Okay. All right. Thanks, Mike. I can try to bring it home here. You haven't seen this slide before, we talk about how we run the company. And this is a snapshot of our consumer business. We have seven SPUs. You see the first six on the left side or the U.S. businesses on international and the far right. So, this is how we break down all the brands that we manage and we manage dozens of brands, but you see most of the power brands are listed here. Maybe wondering why ARM & HAMMER appears for Fabric Care, Home Care and Personal Care. In Fabric Care, we have an ARM & HAMMER detergent. In Home Care, we have baking soda and litter. And over in Personal Care, we have a toothpaste and under armed ext. But we got -- these are all broken down into very manageable businesses. And over an international, as Mike just described, too. We have one-third of the business is the GMG, our export business and two-thirds is the subsidiaries  Okay. So here are five operating principles, which I'm going to kind of walk through. The first thing is leverage brands. So we focus on brands that consumers love. It's not brands consumers like. It's brands consumers love. They're going to stick with you are going to walk out of the store, looking for your brand. The second thing is we've been a long-time friend of the environment. This company was founded in 1846, and the founders of the company were environmentalists and that's continuing to stay. Leverage people I'm going to talk about. We have a wonderful group of people in our company. We have 5,200 employees. We have over $5 billion in sales. We have over $1 million of sales per employee and leverage assets, many of you who are long-term holders now that we're focused on being asset-light.  And finally, if you do the first four right, you get good returns, but if you're able to make smart acquisitions, integrate them and grow them, you're going to get great returns. And that's what we have gotten over the years.  Okay. Leverage brands already mentioned that. We have 14 power brands that make up 85% of our leverage -- of our sales and profits. Friend of the environment, and we'll go in a little bit deeper on that. So you've probably seen this before. It's a good reminder that if you went back to the 19th century, we were putting trading cards in our boxes of baking soda. And those cards were pictures of birds. And they said, save the birds, save the planet.  In 1907, we started to use recycled paperboard in our cartons. No one was doing that back then. We were the first to take phosphates out of laundry detergent back in the '70s. And we were the first and only sponsor of the first Earth Day. And 20 years later, in 1990, Church & Dwight was still the only corporate sponsor for Earth Day.  More recently, we started plant trees in the Mississippi River Valley. Trying to offset the carbon dioxide that we put into the air. And if I go all over to the far right, we now we're committed to science-based targets. So when you plant trees, you remember from fifth grade science you take two out of the atmosphere, and science-based targets, what we're focusing on is spending money on CapEx to reduce the amount of CO2 we put into the atmosphere.  All right. So here are some of our goals. So you say we aim to be 100% carbon neutral by 2025. That means we will have planted enough trees since 2016 to offset all the CO2 we put into the atmosphere. And it's pretty considerable. For a small company like ours, we put 350,000 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually. So this is really important to us. You see, we mention of science based targets below there. Water, we're trying to reduce water usage by 10% annually. And in solid waste recycling, we'd like to recycling 75% of the solid waste from all of our sites. Got a lot of recognition about that, the FTSE, EPA Green Power. Safer Choice partner, we've been a safer choice partner for the past seven years. And this is important to our management team. It's important to our employees. It's important to the families of our employees as well, but it's also important to our consumers. So you can see, it's really a top priority for so many consumers today, particularly younger consumers.  All right. The fifth principle is to leverage people. So we say we have highly productive people and a place where people matter. When you invest in a company, you bet on people, and you bet ideas and their ability to execute those ideas. And I can tell you, we have a really strong management team. But it's not just the management team, it's also the 5,000 people that we have in our company. 3,000 of those people are in supply chain, 60% of the company. That is the backbone of Church & Dwight.  And when you think about what's the culture in Church & Dwight. Any member of our management team could take you through this. It's a blue-collar company. That's not a dress code thing. This is how you will go to work every day. It's a roll up your sleeves environment. We've got a lot of high-aptitude people in the company. Many of them have worked in other large CPG companies. Wanted to go smaller where they could make a difference. So it's blue collar, high aptitude, underdog.  So we compete against companies that are far, far larger than us and you know who they are. We never use that as an excuse. We beat these big companies every day. The fourth thing is getting the facts. So we -- it's a company we're maniacal about numbers and data. And one point of time, people made decisions based on the person who had the gray hairs in the room, the gray beards like me. So I know best, I've got 40 years’ experience, no more. That is not how business is done. Now it's done based on data, and we are oriented towards data, and we have data sciences in the company now, and we're becoming more and more focused on predictive analytics.  Just to kind of round it out, digitally savvy is something that's very important to us. That's something we've focused on over the past five or six years. Diversity is the last one -- second lesson one. And finally, it's take risks. We want to be risk takers in the company. The way we illustrate that, we actually have a picture of Johnny Depp from Pirates of the Caribbean that we use when we're talking about this internally and say, "Hey, this is who we are." So I just want to give you a little bit of background on that.  And here's some numbers. Here's all of our competitors and is our revenue per employee. And I think this is an underappreciated statistic when it comes to investing. We get mix. It makes a big difference when you've got fewer people, you get focused on fixing things, making things better, and its magic. All right. We have a simple compensation structure in the company. Many of you know from following us for many years, it's revenue, gross margin, cash and EPS. And what that does is it makes the company financially literate. So when we're talking about gross. We're talking about gross margin in every part of the company. When I go into a plant, we have 15 plants. We do town halls with all three shifts. We'll talk about gross margin. What is it? How do you get it? It's part of our compensation. And then as far as how do you get gross margin? It was good to great is the name of our productivity program. And it's a book that everybody has heard about, probably no one's read, but that's the name we use to describe our productivity program.  Supply chain optimization, that's also how do we run our plants, what kind of capital we're putting in our plants which plans should we make a product that. New products, if you introduce new products that have higher gross margins, it's going to help you as well. And then finally, acquisition synergies. We like to buy businesses that have gross margins that are at or higher than our current gross margins. All right, leverage assets. Rick took you through this before. We pride ourselves on being asset-light. And historically, we've been around 2% of sales. It spiked back in 2009 when we built our gigantic plant in New York, Pennsylvania. It's spiking more recently because we're investing in so many different categories. But that's a good signal. You don't put in new capacity if you don't think you're going to grow. So we're going to be able to fill that up over the next couple of years. All right. And finally, leverage acquisitions. I mentioned that before. If you do that well, you can turn good returns into great returns. All right. And I just want to repeat the acquisition criteria in case you missed it previously. So we invest in brands that are number one or number two in their category. You're not going to see us invest in a brand that's number four or five and tell you the investor, we're going to drive that to number one. That's not going to happen.  The brands are number one and number two for reasons. That's what we focus on. They need to be high growth, high margin and fast-moving consumables. Asset-light is our preference. We want to be able to leverage our substantial footprint around the world. And again, needs to have a long-term competitive advantage. So with respect to cash, we have 14 brands today, we are like 20 tomorrow.  I just want to kind of end on the look ahead. So you saw in the release, we said, "Hey, we got strong fundamentals going into 2023."We got top line strength, both reported and organic. We got gross margin expansion. We've got a terrific new product pipeline, you only heard about one today, but there are many others as well. We're jacking the investment in advertiser. That's going to help us not only in '23, but in future years. Rick took you through the capacity expansion.  And finally, we generate lots of cash. And so we're on the hunt for our next power brand. And with that, I'm going to bring up the rest of the management team, and we'll do some Q&A play stump the band for a little while. All right. Come on up gang.
A - Matthew Farrell: All right, Kevin, I'm going to call on you first.
Unidentified Company Speaker : There's a microphone coming right down.
Matthew Farrell: No, we want to get you a mic.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Kevin Grundy, Jefferies. So thank you for the presentation. A question for the group with Matt certainly start with you. So last year, certainly, probably one of the more challenging to get that the most challenging yet that the company has dealt with the economic environment, excuse me, certainly challenged, but it was for your competition as well. So as you kind of do a postmortem on the year and you kind of think about supply chain, you think about your portfolio, you think about your relationships with retailers. What are sort of like the biggest learnings would you say operationally for the company? And then looking forward, what's the message for the investment community that there should still be a lot of confidence in the Evergreen target?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Okay. It's quite a big question. I think every companies have flexibility and so it creates options. And I think going into the COVID, the pandemic and certainly the recession this past year, on our supply chain side, we didn't have the options. I think less than 15% of our raw materials had redundancy. And our target right now is to have 50% redundancy. So we've come a long way over the last couple of years. And that's why I said earlier that we're focused on -- be ready for the next black swan event.  As far as the portfolio goes, 80% of our portfolio did exceedingly well. And we had 20% of the portfolio went backwards. And some of it is self-inflicted, and that is with respect to vitamins and our ability to supply. That has certainly hurt us both on sales as well as in the market share, but we're starting to turn underrun.  And then from a device standpoint, certainly learned our lesson with respect to FLAWLESS. FLAWLESS struggled in '20 and '21 through COVID, '22 because of the pullback as it's a discretionary purchase. But WATERPIK is different. WATERPIK is also a device, but do you have a secular trend towards interest in gum health. And that's the business we bought in 2017. It grew high single digits in '17, '18, '19, '20, '21.  And went backwards this year. Why we had the recession, $5 gas, et cetera. But that's going to turn around, and that's going to be growing, not only in the U.S. but also internationally for us, but I could go on. But there are many areas of the company that I would say we'd look back and say, "Yes, okay, we've been a little bit differently now but now we're -- we got our eyes open going forward.  Thanks, Kevin.  Rupesh?
Rupesh Parikh: Thanks for taking my question. So just on pricing, I guess, looking forward to this year, is there any pricing -- new pricing incorporated in your guidance for this year? And if you look at last is, how do they play out versus expectations? Have they gone back to where you've historically been? Or are they still better than the history?
Matthew Farrell: Second question, price gaps.
Rupesh Parikh: Elasticity question, just elasticities, how they compare versus your expectations and versus history?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. We'll do it the elasticities first. And elasticities have been surprisingly good over the past year. So -- and I think you probably heard that from all of our CPG competitors. The first part of your question was…
Rupesh Parikh: Just on pricing [indiscernible]. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, I'll just start off, and he's going to have a little bit of chance to think of a better answer, but my answer would be the following: we already have pricing in place that's going to be in the marketplace in February and March, but it was sold in already. So we don't have anything ahead of us with respect to, hey, we got pricing planned in the second half or in the fourth quarter because it's going to be -- it's becoming exceedingly more difficult in order to push price through and get away.
Richard Dierker: That was a great answer. The organic outlook for us is 3%. It's price in 2023 and volumes were flattish. We had that in the release, and that's really because we had carryover price from 2022. And then there's additional pricing that's already been sold in, like you said, it's effective in February. So that's really the preponderance of the 3% organic growth next year.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Yes. Lauren.
Lauren Lieberman: Thanks. In the release this morning and then also in the presentation today, there was a notable absence of discussion around the VMS business. So thought it'd be great to just get an update on where things stand from an internal standpoint, supply raw material availability and also from a consumer demand standpoint, had early cough in flu, cold and flu. So where do we stand on kind of normalizing demand or what you think that will look like?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. That's a good question. I'll let Barry and Paul comment as well. But the vitamin business in January, it's a vitamin category in January was down 10% year-over-year. And the reason for that is because if you went back to last year, you had Omicron and Delta, and you had a huge spike. In fact, the first quarter last year, you may remember from the slides, we had only 70% fill rate because we just couldn't staff our plants. So that's an issue for the category right now.  As far as our issues go, yes, we've had some self-inflicted wounds over the year. Our supply has started to come back as well. Now we have to win back the consumer. But I'll dish it over to Barry first and then Paul, if you want to add that.
Barry Bruno: Yes, Lauren. I think we see the category as struggling as we're comping Omicron, and it's a discretionary category. When you're making a decision about $15, $20 vitamins. And as you saw in my campaign or regular grocery bills up $400 consumers are stepping back from the category. So good news, our supply rates are improving. Category is declining slightly. We're waiting to see what happens now as we get past the Omicron comp, how it looks. But we're going to be in a position to meet consumer demand as we get into the back half of Q1 here. 
Lauren Lieberman: And just a quick follow-up because the outlook range, I mean it's the beginning of the year, it's not just early in the year and giving ourselves a lot of room as you navigate through infinite sense. But I'm curious how much of the year's outlook is actually contingent on what happens with VMS because it's got attractive margins, a wide range of outcomes, right, in terms of where the category settles out. Just curious how important that is the full year outlook.
Barry Bruno: Yes. What we said in the release is we had three categories that really hurt us last year through brands, where it's got WATERPIK flows and vitamins. And we said three of those together, we expected modest growth in the aggregate in 2020, but it's not going to be pulling the train -- businesses.
Richard Dierker: In 2022, remember, those three businesses were about a 4% headwind to organic growth. In the quarter, they were as well, right? We had 0.4% organic, but we would have been at 4.5%, if not for those businesses. And we said for the full year, that's going to true as well, 4% headwind. Just the absence of that headwind, they're flattish to slightly positive next year.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Olivia, your hand up before.
Olivia Cheang: Thank you. My question is around the cadence of margins because, obviously, you're starting the year at a lower point. But you said that gross margin would be up in Q1. So could you talk a little bit about what's embedded in the outlook as you progress through the year? Because expect that SG&A is up pretty considerably in Q1. Is that advertising? Or is there other expenses that we should be mindful of? And what happens as year progresses? Thank you. 
Matthew Farrell: Okay, Rick, do you trust me to handle this one,
Richard Dierker: Do you want me to handle that? To give you something. Gross margin is like we said, stairs up through the year. Part of that is the mix headwind in the front part of the year that we just experienced in the back half of this year because of the discretionary businesses like WATERPIK, Vitamins typically have good gross margins.  Other part of it is as our fill rates recover, right? I think you saw a slide that Barry had up there showing 93% fill rates in the first half, 97% fill rates in the back half. So as you have fewer truckloads as you have fewer fines from retailers, all those things up gross margin as your supply improves. SG&A, we haven't really got into the quarterly SG&A. SG&A is higher in Q1, and part of that we put in the release was just timing of equity grants as well.
Mark Astrachan: Okay. Mark Astrachan at Stifel. Two related questions. So one, M&A, which is a stronger contributor, I think, than many expected in the fourth quarter. What drove that? And then how do we think about the contribution from M&A for '23 relative to what you had said about HERO?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, we had a really strong quarter -- new acquisition HERO. It actually exceeded expectations. I think this consumer is driving that. And we also had the opportunity to spend more in marketing in the fourth quarter for Hero after we bought the business that came in, in October. But yes, as far as 2023, I would say, yes, it's a little stronger than we expected when we first bought it. So that's going to help us. And you can see our range -- the gap between reported, which is on average 6% and 3%, which is organic. Most of that is the payroll business.
Richard Dierker: And just to give you a couple of numbers. We will end the year for HERO in 2022, around $180 million, we said when we bought it, it would be a 15% grower in 2023. You roll that forward and that means it's about 3%, and you're going to take the Q4 of 2022 out of the comp, but it's about a 3% tailwind for 2023.
Mark Astrachan : And on the EBIT line, I mean, I know what you said about interest expense. So what about from contribution there given the higher revenue, same sort of flow through?
Richard Dierker: Well, we're investing more marketing and I'll let Barry talk to it a little bit, but we are -- as we expand distribution, we're going to spend more marketing for national campaigns, right? So it is a virtuous cycle for HERO.
Barry Bruno: That we've never had a national campaign before because they weren't in national distribution, right? And like seem obvious. But we're getting excited about launching the first campaign to tell people all about acne patches because they still don't even realize what they are in many cases, household penetration versus total acne care lags by 10 times, 20 times, so that form we're going to educate about as the category leader, we benefit from that. So that's all new as we're building distribution at the same time. So I think it's a pretty exciting hero story. We've kept the whole Hero team with us, by the way. They're a great strong team, and they're leading that business today. So excited about here going forward.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Jonathan over to you.
Jonathan Feeney: I'll start. Jon Feeney at Consumer Edge. You mentioned, Matt, a lot of CPG companies talking about elasticities are better, let's say, but yet everybody's get gross margin headwinds. And I wonder the data seems to say that consumers are quite receptive and you get retailers in November, December to how hard things are event one that was talking to food companies about why they need to lower prices.  So could you give us a little more -- shed a bit more light, maybe unlike that pricing process where -- I mean, if -- why wouldn't you just price in some of these categories until you got the elasticity you were looking for and optimize the profit pool that way?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, I'm sure you know the way it works is in order to raise price, you have to have a cost story. And without the cost story, you don't get the price. And the retailers have all the data about what's going on in the marketplace with respect to commodities, transportation, et cetera. So it's -- it is a negotiation about, hey, this is what we're seeing on the cost side. We need this price increase and then there's a debate. -- and Paul lives this every day. You can give Paul the mic and he can share it a little bit with you. But yes, that is it around the world with all the retailers is. You can only go as far as you can justify with cost.
Paul Wood: Yes. I'd simplify it as transparency, the retailers expect you to be transparent with them to that cost story that he said. I think we've been extremely successful in being transparent. That develops a trust. So when we do come in and share a transparent story and timing is important, too. Retailers have financial demands and controls and different things. And I think we've been very good at being showing them where the world is moving, where we expect -- so we have these conversations. They're not surprises. So trust transparency and timing, I would say, has been our secret sauce. And while it may seem a cliche and everyone should do it. I think that's what's allowed us to experience the elasticities we have and make the choices we have as well.
Anna Lizzul: Hi, thank you. Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. I was wondering if we could go back to the conversation around marketing investment. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about how you're planning to allocate this increased investment between your legacy brands and maybe some of the more recent acquisitions? And then just in terms of acquisitions, how are you thinking about maybe the personal care side versus discretionary just given the success of some of your more recent acquisitions like HERO versus some which maybe have been less successful in the past? Thanks. 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I'll let Barry comment on the marketing. With respect to acquisitions, we only hire one person in our entire acquisition, M&A department, which is very church and Dwight like. So we're not have a dozen people that are studying categories saying, wouldn't it be wonderful to be in this category. Yes, it might be, but you can only buy what's for sale. So anything that's for sale, particularly in the U.S., that's consumer products, we are aware of and you know what our acquisition criteria is as well.  And we've -- even in the last six months, there's three acquisitions that we diligence that we passed on, had good economics, but they just didn't -- we didn't think they had good long-term potential for the company. But because we're able to make so many different products, we're in so many different categories, we can liquid in a bottle. We can put powder in a box. We put anything in a tube. We know how to make lots of things. So consequently, we can throw a pretty wide net as far as things that we might be able to take on as a company. But I'll dish it over to, Barry.
Barry Bruno: Sure. Yes, we've got a lot of brands in our portfolio. We've got a classic brand classification approach we take, and it won't surprise you their seed and there's grow and they're sustaining milk, 80% of the incremental dollars that we're putting in is going against those seed and grow brands. It won't surprise you if I say a seed brand as a hero is a thorough breadth we're reporting kind of gasoline or maybe see is better to say putting water on them, maybe gasoline is a bad example. But that's where the spend is going.  We make hard choices about it. We'd always like to spend more, but those -- in our brand classification, we know where we want to put those dollars and that's how we allocate it. So I won't get into those specific brands here, but that's how we approach it. When you've got 14 power brands, you're going to make hard choices, but we know where to put those dollars to work. We think HERO is certainly one of them.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Okay. Let's move to another table. Thank you, guys. 
Filippo Falorni: Some of your competitors have talked about retailers reducing their inventory levels. I wonder if you guys have seen any impact in your business and particularly what categories you see most of the impact.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Okay. Well, Barry and Paul will deal with this every day. But I can tell you, in the fourth quarter, we had a major e-retailer significantly reduced their inventories and their days of supply. So that was a hit with respect to the fourth quarter. We did see a lot of that pullback happen midyear in 2022, but more recently, it was more retailers, but I'll let Paul and Barry comment on that. Take it away.
Paul Wood: Yes. By and large, we're back to a ship to consumption model. I'd say the retailers -- some may have their other challenges within their own network. They want to ship more product, but they may have constraints at their DCs or getting it out of their own DCs to their stores. But by and large, it's a ship to consumption. You guys or in stores across the country, you see what I see. We need more inventory on the shelves. It's just a matter of catching up. But I do not feel like what Matt described last year, is anywhere or the other side of that book shelf. And we want to get back -- they want to get back at just getting that product through their warehouse and through their network, but very small.
Barry Bruno: It was really in Q3 and Q4, though, for sure. We felt it. 
Christopher Carey : Chris Carey, Wells Fargo. So from a ship to consumption standpoint, we've continued to see scanner trends, which are a lot stronger than your underlying results, right? So even in this quarter, there might have been a 10-point gap between what you did in personal care delivery versus what we can see in scanner. And so. Are we starting to get to the point where non-e tailer, so large e-retailer, that is going to remain noisy, but are you getting back to a shift to consumption in your core brick-and-mortar retailers because, again, we're seeing strong results in personal care consumption than what you're actually reporting, right? And it's making it a lot harder to actually call quarters and understand what the underlying trend here is, right?  So if you're back to ship to consumption, that would seem to be a positive development. But I guess what I'm hearing is actually that inventory will remain volatile in the front half of the year. So I'm just trying to square the.
Richard Dierker: Chris, you're -- the major difference between what you guys can see in Nielsen or IRI versus what's actually happening and on the personal care side is really what's happened in the discretionary business. Like the WATERPIK coverage that you don't see, I remember the universe is this small or your view through Nielsen or IRI on the WATERPIK business. Your view is largely a bit smaller for the FLAWLESS business as well. I think those two things are a big part of the disconnect. But take a step back, a lot of the portfolio is growing consumption really well. I think as you see Hero add to distribution and other retailers, you're going to see that, that gets picked up correctly. It just has to get scaled up to a greater degree. Anything you guys would add?
Paul Wood: Yes, I was going to answer if you had funded to be first. I would say the syndicated piece does matter, right? A lot of the personal care brands and what those retailers are, what you can see versus what we see. And it's not an excuse, that's just kind of where the business is and some of those just tracked the way that you guys are seeing it in the system. So I think Rick hit it.
Christopher Carey: And just related, if I could, but the supply chain improvement is the inventory improvement and the shift of consumption. We've seen promotions come back up, specifically on your laundry business. Was that an impact on price mix in the quarter? And can you just describe that promotional activity, whether -- it certainly looks like it was more offensive as supply came back, you promoted behind laundry. But am I reading that situation wrong? And just again, any impact on the quarter, would be helpful.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Let me give you some help with sold on deal for the categories that generally have lots of promotion. And then Rick or Barry or Paul can chime in. So if you look at the liquid laundry detergent, okay, Q2 versus Q4 you'd see that the sold under was 31% in Q2. It's 33% in Q4 for liquid laundry detergent.  If you look at unit dose, it was 28% sold on deal in Q2, and it's 33% in Q4. So it's 500 basis points move. And then the other category that's a lot of promotion is litter. So litter was 11.5% sold on deal in Q2, and it's 14% in in Q4. So you've seen a move up. Now historically, liquid laundry detergent is kind of mid-30s sold on deal. Litter, however, is still low. It's typically high teens.  So things have heated up a little bit in the last couple of quarters, but it hasn't gone to the point where it's a rocket ship or it's a big spike. It's sort of gradual. And as we look ahead to 2023. I would say our sold on deal were probably similar to what we did in Q4 evenly throughout the year. So if anybody wants to chime in, you can.
Richard Dierker: I would also say year-over-year, yes, it's a drag because we're lapping a period where we didn't really have as much promotion. Fill levels were low. And so now as we get back to normal levels of promotion, is it a year-over- year drag, yes. Is it offset is off base from what our historical levels have been now.
Barry Bruno: But supply allows us to get back to advertising and trade that are at normative levels, I would say, right? We're not wildly off where we've been historically, but that allowed us to in Q4 get back to normative levels.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. All right. Finally, this side of the room. Coming to life. 
Unidentified Analyst : I'll take a second shot on M&A. And I think that some of it was in the earlier question was if perhaps you're thinking about discretionary differently in the context of future M&A. It does feel like when you think about something like ZICAM where you bought a cold remedy company at a time where nobody was getting cold. But it also sounds like a lot of discretionary assets that you might be looking at are also equivalently struggling forgetting about what's in your business right now. So can you maybe just talk about how you're thinking about M&A in terms of is discretionary still on the table? Or has this recent experience maybe changed your mind about discretionary as part of your...
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, let's go back to ZICAM for a minute. And we bought ZICAM has a brand, a very strong brand equity. And we renew we were buying it in the middle of COVID. We thought long term, this is a business that has opportunity to grow. And the opportunity with respect to ZICAM is similar to a brand like Emergency which is not episodic now and its sort of an everyday brand that many consumers use. That's the opportunity for ZICAM long term is converted -- also is having ZICAM in a gummy form.  You got to keep in mind, we were in supplements with Vitafusion. So it made a lot of sense for us to add on to that as I can. So just to give a little bit of context. Now as far as discretionary versus nondiscretionary, yes, a recent experience does influence our attitude going forward. And certainly, if you're going to buy a discretionary brand, -- the question is going to be how resilient is going to be the downturns in the marketplace because, obviously, with -- certainly with respect to vitamins, FLAWLESS and WATERPIK. The economy did affect the performance of those brands over the past year. So it does influence that. It doesn't mean that we're -- it's hard and fast. We're going to extrude them. But I will tell you the devices you can put it next through going forward. Steve?
Stephen Powers: Yes. So Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. So I wanted to go back to pricing, a two-part question. The first one is just pricing in the quarter relative to what we're seeing in scan data. Pricing came in light. So I don't know how much of that is the promotion, how much of that is some of the mix that we don't see. But just you can bridge that gap would be helpful.  And then as you go forward, as for as much pricing as you have taken and are taking, your pricing net of cost inflation is still has not cut up and it's not expected to catch up in your gross margin bridge. All your gross margin is productivity and fill rates and mix, which is great. a lot more emphasis on volume resumption in your messaging and value. So just philosophically, how you're thinking about that? And I guess, a little bit to John Feeney's question about just why not price a bit more, if you last this is your favorable to close that price versus cost inflation gap.
Matthew Farrell: Yes, I'll start, and I'll dish it to Rick. So as far as the fourth quarter goes, certainly, mix had an impact as we talked about earlier with respect to WATERPIK and vitamins and flows year-over-year -- promotions, which we went through also since that's kind of been heating up Q2, 3, 4. It's gradual, but it still had an impact in the fourth quarter. But I would say the two factors would be mix, number one and number two was heat up and sold on deal as far as the trend with respect to price mix.
Richard Dierker: Yes. And as for 2023, if you look at the components in the gross margin bridge, they're all switched together. But I'll tell you, by the end of 2023, we do think that we've priced the dollars on inflation, okay? What you're seeing there is negative mix, again from the first half of the year on the flawless WATERPIK vitamin businesses. We talked last quarter as an example of -- in WATERPIK units were flattish to down slightly, but everyone was trading down to lower-priced units. That's where it shows up on the gross margin bridge is a headwind.  But overall, we feel really good about our pricing and what we've done. And if you remember, rewind the clock a little bit. We were the first to go out with laundry pricing. We're not a leader in that category. We were the first to go out in litter pricing because we knew it wasn't if, but just when. And so we had the call story. We had the justification and we moved. And so we feel really good about our pricing. It's a core competency in the company now.  I would say about seven years ago, we started a pricing department, and we have people that all they do every day just look at pricing and where we should be and what we should do. And so we have all these plans in place, and we've had a successful selling at retail because we have transparency, and we have the facts to back it up.
Matthew Farrell: And so we're not timid about raising prices, as you know Steve, as you just heard the what the history was with respect to when we've raised price. But we also have to be cognizant of what's going on in the category, the category dynamics and our price gaps with our competition. So I think -- I mean you and John are beaten on the same topic, but we've taken it as we think as far as we can at the moment with that because we do need cost justification to go few further. Okay. Andre.
Andrea Teixeira : Just Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Just to squeeze in to Steve's question on the pricing. And also the volume side, I guess you had a big impact on the fourth quarter and the full year, 4% for those of 20% of your businesses that were down. So I'm thinking as we think into the first half of this year, right, you're calling for a decline in volumes. Is that mostly on that or you're adding on a bit of elasticity in the first half of the year? It seems as if it's opposite like the existing -- the other 80% is going to grow volumes.
Richard Dierker: Yes. I would say it's more of the same what we just experienced in Q4. All right? The 80% of the business is doing well. Volumes are up, and it's really the drag from those other businesses that we said were going to be choppy for the first six months of 2023.
Matthew Farrell: We've got a mic on the side of the room.
Peter Grom: Peter Grom, UBS. So Rick, you showed the slide talking about gross margin performance over time? And then recognizing you're expecting to have a nice bounce back year here in '23. You're still kind of 200 basis points or so below kind of the 2019, 2020 gross margins. And I don't want to sit here and asking question for 2024 guidance in February of 2023.  But you spoke to multiyear of opportunity on gross margin expansion. So I guess how big of a priority is that in terms of getting back to that level over time? And as you think about the cadence of the year and kind of look forward here, like how quickly can you get back to 45% gross margin.
Richard Dierker: Yes. That's a great question. Number 1 priority in the company is always to grow our brands, right, have brands consumers love, grow share over time in good categories. The number two priority is probably gross margin. Gross margin expansion leads to EBITDA expansion leads to cash flow, right? We're known for cash flow generation.  And I would say, two things really help give us confidence over the next few years. If you look back at our history, we normally have about $50 million of inflation. We haven't had $50 million inflation, it feels like for a decade. It's only been three to four years, but it feels like so long. $290 million of inflation in 2021, $250 million in 2022. We're calling $125 million in 2023.  That is not normal, right? We're going to return to the days of normalized inflation. And meanwhile, our productivity program is alive and well, even stronger than it's ever been. So as that -- you saw in the bridge, I think that was closer to 100 plus basis points. We target closer to 2% on productivity. So if that equation normalizes, I think that's a great way we're going to have gross margin expansion. And then number two, as our businesses like THERABREATH and like HERO continue to grow and expand globally, that's going to be a great tailwind too.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Just some math. I think the -- our gross margin just a few years back, pre-COVID, 45%. It's 41.9% in 2022 recalling 100, 120 basis points improvement. So pick the midpoint, so you go 41.9%, 43% in 2023. And then I used to dish it over to Rick Spann for a minute. By the way, Matt Duffy is here today. He's one of the on people that drives are good to great program, and we target 2% of sales for cost savings annual. It's $100 million. That's a big number. It's a huge effort to make that happen, but that's what it works referring to week we're able to sustain that going forward. And any kind of help from commodities and input costs, we'll be able to return to expand gross margin in the future. But Rick, anything to add about the target-rich environment. You've all seen Top Gun.
Rick Spann : Sure. Four years ago, we made a conscious effort to increase our focus on our -- good to -- great program, our productivity program. We brought Matt Duffy on who's in the room, as Matt said, to lead the program. And it was a push in the beginning. We couldn't get a lot of traction in the company. It's now part of our culture. We have marketing leaders asking us what else we can do to drive cost savings. We have the R&D community focusing on it. We've created a value engineering team whose sole focus is to break down our products and figure out more effective ways to go to market with those products from a cost standpoint. So it really is part of the culture now it's driving much bigger savings than it was four years ago.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. As far as call-outs, I neglected to point out that our entire M&A department is actually here on the stage. So if you want to talk to him after Class, please do. All right. Any other questions, no, I guess that concludes it today. I was so happy we were able to do this in person this year and look forward to seeing everybody next year. Thank you.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on today's call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We've got lots to talk about. I'm going to begin with a review of Q3 results. Then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open the call for questions. First off, I'll say, we revised our full year revenue outlook in early September, and we're tracking to hit 3%, which was the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range at that time.  In Q3, reported revenue was up 0.4%, and that exceeded our expectation of minus 1%.  As you read in the release, while the majority of our brands are performing well. We have 3 businesses that are coloring our results this year. And those are WATERPIK, our vitamin business, and FLAWLESS. And those businesses account for -- accounted for a 6% sales headwind in Q3.  Adjusted EPS was $0.76. Now this was $0.11 higher than our EPS outlook, driven by higher international sales, lower SG&A and timing of marketing spend. The U.S. portfolio grew consumption in 11 of 17 categories. The trade down to value laundry detergent continued as ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent achieved an all-time high market share of 14.3%.  The ARM & HAMMER clumping litter, BATISTE dry shampoo and THERABREATH mouthwash also achieved all-time high market shares. TROJAN condoms returned to share growth and OXICLEAN stain fighters and ARM & HAMMER baking soda delivered double-digit consumption growth.  The strong performance of these businesses is offsetting the impact of the discretionary businesses and vitamins on reported sales. In Q3, our most discretionary brands, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS, which account for approximately 10% of our global sales were impacted by lower customer spending. Similarly, the gummy vitamin category, in which our VITAFUSION brand competes, was impacted by a decline in consumption as fewer households purchased vitamins and supplements and we were also lapping the COVID Delta variant in the prior year quarter.  In Q3, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 15%, and we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15%. Now I'm going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. U.S. consumer, which had 1.7% organic sales decline. Looking at market share, 7 of our 14 power brands held or gained share. Looking ahead, we expect even further improvement in our market share positions in Q4 as we expect our highest fill rates of the year and our highest quarterly promotional and marketing spend.  I want to look at a few of the important categories in the U.S., and I want to start with laundry. The trade down to value detergent which began in Q2 continued in Q3. During Q3, the liquid laundry category grew 3.1%. Now if we break that down, value laundry detergent grew 9%, premium declined 3%. ARM & HAMMER unit dose also benefited from the trade down. Our ARM & HAMMER pods grew consumption by 25% in the quarter compared to unit dose category growth of 4.5%. With more consumers migrating to ARM & HAMMER, the long-term benefit to the ARM & HAMMER brand similar to the last recession.  In litter, the category grew 11%, while ARM & HAMMER litter grew 14%, so we gained share in the quarter. Both our black box, which is premium, and our yellow box, which is value, had double-digit consumption growth in Q3.  In stain fighters, OXICLEAN gained share as consumption was up 10%, while the category grew 7%. The dry shampoo category was up 18% in Q3, driven by BATISTE consumption, which was up 37%, and we now enjoy a 46% market share in dry shampoo. The condom category was up 3.5% in Q3, while TROJAN consumption was up 4.5%. So again, we gained 60 basis points of market share, thanks to our new TROJAN BARESKIN RAW condom and the success of more targeted marketing. Our most recent acquisitions are performing well. THERABREATH, which we acquired in December of 2021, had a great quarter with 46% consumption growth. THERABREATH grew share of 4.3 points to 17.8% of the alcohol-free mouthwash category. THERABREATH is the #2 nonalcohol mouthwash and the clear #4 brand in total mouthwash. THERABREATH is expected to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight in the future.  ZICAM also delivered strong results this quarter. You may recall, we acquired ZICAM in December of 2020. ZICAM is the #1 brand in the cold shortening segment with a 76% share in Q3.  Now looking ahead to Q4, the regular flu season in the U.S. is projected to be far more severe than recent years. And as a reminder, approximately 40% of ZICAM consumption happens in Q4.  We closed on our latest acquisition, Hero, in mid-October. Now while we did that own Hero in Q3, the brand performed extremely well, growing consumption 56% and gaining 3.6 share points to achieve a 14% market share in the total acne treatments category. There's a great deal of excitement here about this business as we look ahead to 2023 and longer term.  All right. Next up is International. Our international business delivered organic growth of 3.2% in Q3, primarily driven by the international subsidiaries, which posted strong growth in the quarter. On the other hand, our Global Markets Group has been impacted by weakening demand in China due to lockdowns, and we expect this to continue in Q4. Finally, Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered 1% organic growth in the quarter. But keep in mind that the 1% organic growth is on top of 18.5% organic growth in Q3 2021. Now I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing our 2 discretionary brands, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS, which have longer purchase cycles. And after that, I'll talk about the vitamin business.  First, WATERPIK. So WATERPIK is the #1 brand in water flossers. We continue to see lower dollar consumption for water flossers in the U.S. However, WATERPIK unit volumes are actually positive both in Q3 and year-to-date as consumers trade down to lower-priced cordless models.  If we look back at 2021 and 2020, the consumer was healthier and a good portion of our growth came from our super premium products like Sonic-Fusion. In 2022, the decline in our flosser sales is driven by trade down and inventory reductions by retailers. Shipments for full year 2022 are expected to decline approximately 20% as retailers reset their inventories and product mix.  We continue to invest in demand-driving activities for WATERPIK, such as Lunch & Learns with dentists and hygienists to drive household penetration of flossers. And in 2023, next year, we expect to return to pre-pandemic levels for Lunch & Learns. Now remember, WATERPIK is the Kleenex of water flossers and 9 out of 10 dentists recommend the product by its brand name. This is extremely important as 60% of consumer purchases are driven by a recommendation from a dental professional. It's fair to say that gum health is not going away and still only 16% of the U.S. population flosses every day.  Now looking back, WATERPIK averaged high single-digit top line growth from 2017 when we acquired the business through 2021. So we're taking a big step back in 2022, but we're confident that the long-term growth prospects for WATERPIK are sound.  Now the other discretionary brand we have is FLAWLESS, which is the #1 brand in women's health hair removal. We're experiencing lower consumption in this category which resulted in higher inventories at retail. Our share has been further hurt by the delay in launching new products caused by the China lockdowns at our supplier.  After the conclusion of a 30-month earn-out period, which ended in 2021, our marketing team took over the front end of the business and has been narrowing the product assortment to the winners. So if you're familiar with the brand, that's Face, Brow, Mani and Pedi. And we're also shifting the focus from older consumers to digital targeting of younger consumers in the beauty space. Now we believe these changes will have a positive impact on the long-term prospects for the business.  Now finally, over in VMS, we have the #1 adult gummy vitamin. Category consumption is being impacted as temporary consumers who were interested in prevention during COVID times have exited the category. Beyond category dynamics, the VITAFUSION brand has also lost some share due to our lower fill rates, particularly earlier in the year.  It's clear that fewer households are purchasing vitamins and supplements post COVID, and the category is being impacted by the recession. So here are some stats. For the last 3 quarters, the category growth rate has been plus 10% in Q1, plus 5% in Q2, and most recently minus 8% in Q3. Now the minus 8% compares to a plus 33% increase in the category in Q3 2021. And there is some good news here. In the first few weeks of October, the rate of category decline has moderated to minus 4%. And longer term, the transition from pills and capsules to gummy vitamins gives us confidence in the long-term appeal of the gummy category.  And I'll conclude with a few takeaways that I'd like to leave you with. The majority of our business is strong. We believe the 3 brands that are coloring our numbers have good, long-term prospects. Case fill is now over 90% and improving. We've ramped up our marketing and trade promotion investment in the second half, especially in Q4, and we have confidence in our Q4 outlook.  Now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you more details on Q3.
Richard Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter EPS was $0.76, down 5% to prior year. The $0.76 was better than our $0.65 outlook primarily due to higher sales, lower SG&A expense and timing of marketing spend.  Reported revenue was up 0.4%, including a 1% drag from currency. Revenue was higher than our outlook of minus 1%.  Organic sales declined 0.7% as volume was down 8.5%, partially offset by positive pricing of 7.8%. Matt reviewed the top line for the segments, so I will go right to gross margin for the company. Our third quarter gross margin was 41.7%, a 250 basis point decrease from a year ago.  Let me walk you through the Q3 bridge. Gross margin was impacted by 580 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodity inflation, distribution and labor. These costs were offset by a positive 190 basis point impact, largely from pricing; positive 20 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 120 basis points from productivity.  Moving to marketing. Marketing was down $20 million year-over-year, although this was a significant increase of $40 million sequentially from our first half 2022 levels of 8% of sales, as our fill rates have improved. Fill rates in Q3 were 91%, and we expect further improvement in Q4.  Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 10.7% in the quarter. We expect continued increase in marketing spend in Q4 to approximately 13% of net sales.  For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased 30 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $19.4 million, a $7.3 million increase resulting from higher average outstanding debt levels and higher interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 20.2% compared to 20.4% a year ago.  And now to cash. For the first 9 months of 2022, cash from operating activities decreased $119.5 million to $534 million due primarily to higher inventory levels from WATERPIK, FLAWLESS and vitamin. We expect inventory levels to come down over the next 12 months.  And as of September 30, cash on hand was $438 million. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 2%, organic sales decline of approximately 1% and gross margin contraction. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.58 to $0.62 per share, a 3% to 9% decrease from last year's adjusted Q4 EPS. This decline is primarily due to significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 25% versus an unusually low tax rate in the prior year of 3.7%, which was largely due to a high number of stock option exercises a year ago.  Turning to the full year, we expect the full year outlook for reported sales growth to be approximately 3%, the midpoint of our previously 2% to 4% range. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 1%. The strong consumption across most of our businesses in 2022 has offset the slowdown in discretionary brands, as Matt talked about. We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be $2.93 to $2.97, a decline of 2% to 3% compared to 2021. The range is influenced by the extent of margin mix within the portfolio. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be 23%. And we now expect cash from operations for the full year to be approximately $800 million.  And our full year CapEx plan is now approximately $170 million as we continue to expand manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future growth in laundry and litter. In closing, we continue to perform in a volatile environment. We expect further market share gains in Q4 as we invest in our brands and our supply chain fill levels continue to improve.  And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: First, just a detailed question. Can you just be a bit more explicit on what changed in the earnings guidance for this year post the early September update? I know there's year-over-year tax rate pressure in Q4, but I think that was known. So just curious on what's changed.  And then second, just on the vitamin side. You guys have articulated that the business is suffering from tough comps versus COVID variance last year, that makes sense. As you think about the business longer term, some of the people that were brought in during COVID, who maybe aren't as loyal to the category, is there sort of risk that this weakness lingers and perhaps they're more susceptible to pullback in consumer spending and won't be as loyal to the category from these sort of on-the-fence users who were brought in during COVID? So just any thoughts on vitamins as you look out more to next year.
Richard Dierker: Yes. Dara, it's Rick. I'll take the margin mix, and Matt will take the vitamin question. So really, the change in the outlook is pretty straightforward. It is -- we didn't change the revenue outlook. We're still the midpoint, the 3% number. The mix to get there has been a little bit different though. The businesses like FLAWLESS and WATERPIK and vitamins have come down and the rest of the household portfolio has gone up. And so that's created a mix pressure. Matt also talked about how there's a trade down for WATERPIK going from the higher-priced units to the lower-priced units, that's also caused a mix issue on a profit basis and that's impacted earnings.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. With respect to vitamins, as you heard in my opening remarks, we've lost some share due to fill rates. So we had lost some consumers to brands earlier in the year. So we got to win them back. And there's definitely fewer households purchasing.  Your question is, , is can we call the bottom? And do we know that all the consumers who are leaving the category have left? Obviously, not knowable. I will say that the coming flu season actually should bolster the VMS category, just beyond COVID because we haven't had a weaker flu season for a few years.  But we -- given it's been many quarters now, several quarters since the end of COVID, we do think things are starting to bottom out. As I mentioned, since we saw that in the fourth quarter that, at least early in the fourth quarter, the decline year-over-year is reduced to 4% where it was 8% in the previous quarter. So it's possible that we could be hitting an inflection point where the category may flatten out and then start to grow.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey of Wells Fargo.
Christopher Carey: I'm trying to determine how much of WATERPIK, FLAWLESS, Vitamin pressure impacted your consumer domestic versus your international segment. You've previously given some perspective on geographic mix of these businesses. I wonder if you can update us on the U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure today or how things look today for those businesses.  And then just connected to that, do you have a sense of what your organic sales growth would have been in your consumer domestic and international businesses, assuming that these frequencies were neutral growth. Obviously, you gave the 6% headwind, which is quite helpful. I'm wondering how that looks out between your reporting regions.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I'll just comment that, as you know, WATERPIK is a global business, so it affects both international and U.S. U.S. being the lion's share of the business. And U.S., is even more -- FLAWLESS even more skewed towards the U.S.  So if -- I don't have those numbers for you. But I think it's fair to say that 6% is probably somewhat equally split for WATERPIK as far as U.S. versus international and more skewed towards the U.S. for FLAWLESS.
Richard Dierker: Yes. And I would only add to that, that we tried to give you a little bit more visibility and granularity into it. But if we were flat for the quarter on net sales, we said those 3 businesses were about a 6% headwind. And as Matt said, our divisions are usually 80-20 split, but WATERPIK is probably more 50-50. But I don't think we'll get any more granularity, but we had a 6% headwind in the quarter.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And Chris, the reason we called that out in the release on the call this morning is because we want to put a ring fence around where our problems are. We got 80% of the business that's really clicking. And we have 3 businesses, we like them on a long-term basis, but certainly hurt us in an environment where you have a weakening consumer, weakening economy.
Christopher Carey: That's really helpful. If I could just follow up quickly and then get back in the queue. Just as it pertains to when the headwinds came together for these businesses, and as such, when you could potentially start lapping those headwinds, is it reasonable to just look at your personal care business and what the growth started to come off? And then can you just confirm whether you're seeing any sequential worsening or you expect stabilization and this is really just about getting beyond tough comps.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I'm sure a lot of people have questions about 2023, but what we can say about that 10% of the business WATERPIK and FLAWLESS is that next couple of quarters, we do expect to be choppy, meaning Q1 and Q2 of next year, just looking at year-over-year comps, et cetera. But we think after that, things are going to even out. .
Richard Dierker: Yes. And then on the Vitamin side, we think that, as Matt said in his prepared remarks, that we're starting to see the minus 8% to minus 4% just because of the Delta variant year-over-year. And we're seeing that start to inflect in a good pattern, so that's about the color we'd give you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Can you maybe talk a little bit about -- and you alluded to some of this, but how are you balancing between how much to advertise versus how much CapEx to put it on the vitamin side versus this uncertainty of demand? Because it sounds like there's a fill rate problem, but there's a demand problem and there's incremental CapEx and advertising going into it. So how are you managing these pieces?
Richard Dierker: I'll start with CapEx and then maybe Matt can end up on the consumer. So -- and I'll talk about demand a little bit, too. So on CapEx, for example, we had said for 2023, we're going to have about $300 million of CapEx, a step-up, and that was laundries, litter and vitamins to recall. We put a pause on the vitamin CapEx. And so that new number for 2023 will be probably between $250 million and $270 million. We'll finalize that when we give our full 2023 outlook. So that's on the CapEx side.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And you had a question about marketing. If you look back over the last few quarters, just kind of round numbers, Q1 and Q2, we had 8% marketing as a percentage of sales. And why? Because we had lower fill rates. So that was prudent not to be spending at a higher rate.  And that amped up in Q3 where it's 10.7%. And you can -- you see we're calling 13% in Q4. And then I'd say next year -- so on a full year basis, this year, we're probably around 10%. But we do expect next year to build on that. So that will move to a higher number. As fill rates become more normal, the marketing spend will also return to a normal rate.
Richard Dierker: And on Vitamins, I would just add, I think it's really key to understand when we're talking about the category, right? And yes, the category was down 8% in 2022, but it was up 33% in 2021. And that's what Matt had in his comments. So on a stacked basis, it's up 25%. So it's not like the category is cratering, I think it's just coming back in line with a super high growth relative to the pre-COVID levels.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. In fact, if you look at the stack rate for Q2, it'd be similar to Q3.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Great. And then on laundry, was any of the strength linked to your ability to supply versus the competition? We've obviously heard of some shortages at some of your competitors. I'm just wondering, is it indeed trading down? Or is it perhaps that you have better supply at the moment than some others?
Matthew Farrell: No, I don't think supply would be a very big factor here. I think this is entirely driven by the economy and the consumer. And we've seen this before many, many years ago during the great recession. So we're seeing it in liquid laundry detergent. We're seeing it in the pods. And one we didn't talk about is Scent Boosters, where Scent Boosters the category was flat, but we were up 3% or 4%.  So everywhere where we have the value, and I'm sure your comment about supply does not extend to all liquid laundry, pods, Scent Boosters every aspect of laundry, so we're seeing it in so many subcategories within laundry. It's weak concluded. It's real and it will continue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Powers: I guess there's -- as I listened to you, in the third quarter, you had both like demand degradation for sure in FLAWLESS and WATERPIK and Vitamins as well as continued supply constraints across the business and then retailer destocking kind of impacting the total portfolio. As we think about going forward, when are you able to -- when do you see yourself shipping to consumption, whether in the core consumables business or in the businesses that have been the biggest drag?
Richard Dierker: Yes. Well, that answer is a little bit more complicated. But our fill rates in Q3 were 91%. We expect in Q4 they're going to be closer to 93%, 94%. Remember, historical full numbers were 98%. So we're within spitting distance of that. There's a few key areas that -- largely raw materials that are still holding us back in a couple of key categories. In some cases, it's capacity for international that's being addressed as well. So I think as we exit this year, in most categories, we'll be shipping to consumption.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. As far as inventory in the channel, Steve, it's -- that's more -- the focus here is more on WATERPIK and FLAWLESS. And that's why we think for the next, say, 6 to 8 months, I think it's going to be choppier for those 2 brands. But we don't have worries about ship to consumption with respect to the rest of the business.
Stephen Powers: Okay. Okay. And then you talked about marketing into next year. Could you give us an update on whether or not you've layered on any coverage on the cost side of things into '23 at this point? And if so, how much? And I guess just in broad brush strokes, do you want -- also walking away from this call thinking that Evergreen is a table for next year? Or is that too ambitious?
Matthew Farrell: We have a range for Q4. You're asking us for a commentary on 2023. So there are pluses and minuses when you think about the 2023. So the majority of our business is doing well. Certainly, there's inflation next year. But early days with respect to RFPs, for procurement and input and things like that.  We're seeing some things come back, but we won't know really for the next 90 days where all those RFPs turn out. I said we're going to have a few choppy quarters from WATERPIK and FLAWLESS.  Laundry is super strong right now. Value is winning. So obviously, we expect that to continue for the next 12 months. Going the other way, we all -- everybody is dealing with higher interest rates and FX, so that's a drag. And then obviously, if we're going to reinflate our marketing spend in 2023, so -- there may be a couple of other pluses or minuses. Rick, anything else you want to throw in there?
Richard Dierker: Yes. I would just say, as Matt said, higher marketing because we're going to have higher fill rates, so that kind of normalizes -- normalized incentive comp. We're going to have a gross margin tailwind though is what we expect. So a lot of puts and takes. We're not ready to call 2023 yet. We'll do that in 3 more months. I would just say we are having some glimmers of hope on the RFPs and some of the commodities are starting to inflect. But again, we're not going to get into that detail.
Matthew Farrell: Yes, it's just way too early to call it, Steve.
Stephen Powers: Okay. And then, Rick, has there been any forward buying and coverage as it relates to commodities for next year? Or are you still in a floating position?
Richard Dierker: That's a good question. So usually, just for context, right, we are usually about 60% to 70% hedged by now. I said last call, we were approximately 0% hedged. I would tell you today, we're about 25%. We did do some diesel before the run-up as an example. But mostly, we're still not back to historical levels on hedging because we believe those costs will continue to come down.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. So all those factors, Steve, they're all material one way or the other. So the question is how big are each of them once we get to the end of January when we call 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC.
Sunil Modi: Just a couple of brand category-level questions. Just on laundry, looking at some of the numerator data, it looks like household penetration is down. And I was just curious on your thoughts around that, what do you think is happening there? And then XTRA in this kind of environment would typically do better than what I'm seeing at least in the scan data. So I just was hoping you could just comment on that. And then I had a question on FLAWLESS.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, as far as households, losing households, that's -- that's not something that's been a topic for discussion here as far as people -- less people doing wash loads. So I can't go any further on that.  As far as XTRA goes, yes, we've been prioritizing ARM & HAMMER over XTRA for the past 18 to 24 months just because of the fill rate issues. That's behind us now. But we are expecting that in 2023, XTRA could clearly be a winner as that's our deep value detergent. And we did see the same phenomenon back in -- during the great recession. So I think that's ahead of us. And you said you had another one too, Nik, on FLAWLESS.
Sunil Modi: Yes, FLAWLESS, just this kind of euthanizing the brand from the older consumer to the younger consumer. I'm curious 20 years of covering this space, when any time a company does that, there tends to be a lot of disruption in terms of alienating the older consumer base, right, as you try to make the brand younger. I'm just curious if you guys have looked into that or worried about that, have seen that. And could that kind of prolong the recovery of that brand?
Matthew Farrell: No. I would say that the size of the prize is so great with the younger consumers that we don't think that, that shift is going to be so dramatic and so noticeable that it's going to alienate the older consumer. So I would say no, that's not a worry.
Sunil Modi: Okay. Great. And then just one more question, Matt, sorry. Colgate earlier today talked about some inventory destocking and some of their categories at brick-and-mortar retail. I'm just curious -- their fill rates obviously have been recovering. I'm just curious if you've seen any of that happening around in the categories you guys operate in.
Richard Dierker: Nik, it's Rick. I'll take it. Early in the quarter, we talked about that. We gave a bit of guidance in September. And we said part of the reason was actually because of inventory destocking at retail and it wasn't just one category, it was multiple categories. And so that was implicitly already in our minus 1 outlook. And so we saw that early in the quarter. But after we got through that, we didn't really see it any further.
Sunil Modi: Okay. So it's basically over. That's what I was trying to get at. Excellent.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: Question for both on the promotional environment and just sort of your expectations there near term. And then as we sort of look out to next year with fill rates normalizing, gross margins still under quite a bit of pressure, a lot of commodity inflation in the P&L, that should start to subside. We're seeing some of that and pricing is start to catch up.  And then, of course, I'm asking about the promotional environment and trade support within the context of some of the earlier discussion around trade down in laundry. There seems to be some differences in opinion, I guess, between some of your commentary and one of your key competitors as to what's driving the share loss. But that's all kind of a big wind up. What's your expectation for trade support? And are you anticipating seeing perhaps considerably more with Procter in a better supply position?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I can't comment on competitors, so you can appreciate that. But if I look at, take laundry detergent and cat litter, so on the household side of the house, and those are the most promotional areas. So the category sold-on deal for liquid laundry was 32% in Q3. And we were at 26%. And obviously, we have competitors that are higher than that. But that 32% was actually down year-over-year. So I still think that the category spend, the promotional environment, is still lower than it has been historically.  And then it's probably worthwhile talking about litter as well. The sold-on deal in litter was 10% in Q3. And that's also historically low as well. Now we were at 13% in Q3, but the 10% and the 13% are still lower than historical levels, which are typically in the high teens level. So it's all ahead of us right now, but I wouldn't say that the environment has been super promotional in Q3, and that could change in Q4 and Q1.
Kevin Grundy: Got it. Quick follow-up, just on M&A. Any thoughts -- I know the balance sheet is in a good shape, you guys can transact. Maybe just comment on the pipeline.  And then in general, just with some of the volatility, and albeit the large majority of the portfolio is performing well, but some of it's not, and given that volatility and some of the focus that it takes from management and the fact that you're integrating Hero, does it give you any pause to potentially transact on something else, even if the balance sheet is in a good place to consummate a deal? So your thoughts there would be helpful, and then I'll pass it on.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, it's important to remember, when we acquire businesses, go back to THERABREATH, for example. We didn't take a whole lot of employees from THERABREATH. And we already have an oral care business, right? So oral care business handles toothbrushes, toothpaste. It's ORAJEL. So we're already in the category dealing with the same buyers. So that was really a tuck-in.  And then when you think about Hero, keep in mind, for Hero, we're hanging on to the 3 founders that are sticking with us for the next few years, and we want to retain all the employees. So we got an intact, high-performing team to run that business. So we don't feel like we're in a position where we can't look at another business.  And as you said, the balance sheet is pretty strong. And as far as the pipeline goes, we are always looking at new deals and have even looked at one since the Hero deal closed. So it's not to say we're going to transact, but we're always looking for strong brands and good categories.
Richard Dierker: And Kevin, it's always a measure of how much complexity the organization can handle at one time, and that has to do with when and how much we're integrating. And the THERABREATH deal, as Matt said, was an easy tuck-in. We're fully integrated from a systems perspective already. Hero, we're going to integrate from a systems perspective by middle of the year. So that's a pretty quick process.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer & Co.
Rupesh Parikh: So on the inventory front, inventories were up 22%. Do you guys see any risk of obsolescence or markdowns with higher inventory levels?
Richard Dierker: Yes. Rupesh, it's Rick. Yes, it's a fair question. I'd say 2 things. One, we expect inventories to get back in line over the next 12 months is what I said in my prepared remarks, right? We've adjusted production levels for some of those long-lead devices we source out of China as an example, like WATERPIK and FLAWLESS. It just takes months to run through that inventory as consumption slowed a bit.  But we have taken some inventory reserves, both in Q2 and Q3, whenever we have long-dated products like that. So we feel like we've already recognized some of that.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then, Rick, on the gross margin, I know you guys called out the mix shift that's a new headwind in Q4. But maybe if you can just walk through some of the puts and takes as you look out for the balance of the year?
Richard Dierker: Yes. I mean I kind of went through the bridge a little bit in my prepared remarks. I would just probably keep it high level. And I would say our -- previously, in Q4, we had said that was the quarter that we expected to inflect positively finally for gross margin. We've been saying it all year long. And so now we're seeing contraction. I would just say that we think it's going to contract slightly. I think it's going to be much improved sequentially. I think we were down 250 in Q3. We're not going to be down, in our opinion, not near that much in Q4. So tailwinds from that perspective. And that's partly because of comps on commodities, it's partly because Q4 itself in the prior year is a little bit lower baseline. But I mean, there are a couple of puts and takes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs.
Jason English: So I guess I want to come back to that question earlier about trying to unpack the impact of the 3 challenged businesses on the U.S. side of things. It looks like it's around $80 million drag. And if we assume 80% of that hit the U.S., which just sounds like that actually may be high given the water back -- WATERPIK [Technical Difficulty]. But either way, if we assume 80% of it, then it equates to about a 14% drag in your U.S. personal care business.  Organic sales over there look like they're down around 16%. So even stripping it out, it looks like your organic sales would still be declining in personal care despite the robust growth you're talking about with BATISTE and despite the recovering growth you're talking about with TROJAN. So can you unpack that a little bit more for us and help us understand, underneath the hood of that personal care business, what else is weighing on performance right now?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. We're -- we haven't done the math. I mean you took a swing out of back of the envelope, but we're not prepared to tell you, okay, for international and for the U.S. business, here we're going to recast what we put in the release by division.
Richard Dierker: Yes. I would just add to that. Remember, our order fill is 91% for the quarter, right? It's a tale of 2 cities, it's probably like 94% for household, it's in the mid-80s for personal care. So you're right, the bulk of the decline in personal care are those 3 businesses. It's FLAWLESS, WATERPIK and Vitamins. We still have 4 or 5 key issues on personal care that we're trying to solve. And we're not going to go through all that detail, but I'll give you an example, right? BATISTE is growing like -- it's doing fantastic, we can't meet all the demand. Consumption is up dramatically. And there's can shortages out there, right? You hear that in the beer industry as an example. And so aluminum cans. But we're trying to add that as quickly as possible to meet that unbelievable demand.  Another example would be VMS, not just because the category is down, but our fill level down is lower than we would like because of one key ingredient on one specific SKU. So there is some personal care pressure because of fill rates that we expect to largely be behind us as we exit Q4.
Jason English: Okay. Okay. And you mentioned the reload of some investment as you go into next year and a normalization or a return to more normal marketing. What does more normal market you mean? And also, incentive comp, is that -- I imagine it is a headwind as we go into next year. Can you give us any context around how incentive comp this year is tracking versus a more normalized level?
Richard Dierker: Yes. I would say incentive comp is going to be a headwind next year. We're tracking anywhere between a 30% payout, as an example. It's probably the best ballpark I'd give you. And so that will be a headwind next year as we get back up to 1.0 payout would be our expectations. Your first question was on -- remind me, Jason.
Jason English: Marketing, marketing. Matt mentioned that you would expect to return to more normal marketing. My question was what does that mean? .
Richard Dierker: Yes, yes. And I think we'll go through that in February. We'll be very clear on what it is and what it means. I think you should expect that it's a stairstep over time back to what we think has been our sweet spot in marketing from a historical perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: So my question is on VMS. Again, I understand this segment, and correct me if I'm wrong, about -- represents about 10% of sales. And on top of the WATERPIK and FLAWLESS issues that you discussed, it seems that the issue has been consumption, and I obviously understand you're comping a very high comparison from last year. But how much of the VMS business is down in the quarter and year-to-date? So -- and with that, are you worried about if retailers, if there is excess inventory? I know it's a fast-moving item, but I was just wondering if that can be -- or if that's embedded in your guidance in the fourth quarter, that there could be some issues with destocking there as well, except, of course, that SKU that is not being served.
Richard Dierker: Yes. Thanks, Andrea. I think -- there's 2 core issues with the vitamin portfolio. One is the category, that is the overarching and greatest issue. And we quoted a little earlier about 2021 Q3 was 33% growth. And so we're coming off that extreme high. It's coming off a little bit more than we thought. But that's what's been happening in these last 13 weeks or so. And we expect that to kind of intend you but inflect a little bit better as we move forward, right? So that's the biggest one.  The second one is fill levels, and Matt kind of went through that a little bit as well. And we expect that as we exit the year, our fill levels for vitamins will improve, so that will help our share.  So those are the 2 biggest things. I probably wouldn't give you much more detail than that in terms of how big that -- we try to give you a little bit more granularity at this time that, hey, 10% of the business is the discretionary portfolio, FLAWLESS and WATERPIK, and another 10% is this vitamin number. I think the key take home comment though is really 2 parts of it, and it's predominantly more of the category than a fill level issue.
Andrea Teixeira: No, that's fair. And then the 80% of the remaining business is probably growing like a mid-single.
Richard Dierker: Yes. If you do the math, 80% of the rest of the business is growing 4%, 4.5%, which is fantastic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anna Lizzul of Bank of America.
Anna Lizzul: I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the topic of promotions. We've been hearing from some of your peers that promotions are essentially not really going to return to the same depth as they were pre COVID. So just wondering if you're comfortable here with your frequency and depth of promotions where you are now versus pre COVID?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I mean, where we are right now, we're winning. So some of the numbers I quoted, the category in liquid laundry is 32%, we're at 26%. And we're gaining share. So you're right, it would appear that there's no need for a heat-up, but I can't predict what competitors will do in the next 6 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Raymond James.
Olivia Cheang: My question is on pricing and promotion. You obviously saw a 1 point sequential acceleration in price/mix in Q3, but obviously, some pressures on the higher price portion of your portfolio while pricing on the everyday consumables. So can you give a little bit of color on what impact mix had versus price? And then perhaps a little bit on domestic household versus personal care.
Richard Dierker: Yes. I don't have the domestic household versus personal care in front of me, but I can help you with the price/volume mix kind of across time. In Q1, we had 7.8% growth in price/mix. And then we went to 6.2% in Q2. And we said that was largely because of the WATERPIK mix issue. From Q2 to Q3, we bumped back up to 7.8%. And so that new laundry and litter pricing that was really announced in Q2, we had a full year -- full quarter impact of that in Q3. So that was overweighing any other drag from WATERPIK or whatnot. So then -- yes, so that's kind of the sequence of events on some of the drivers of price mix.
Olivia Cheang: Got it. And then on Vitamins. I'm curious your view on what you think vitamin consumption trends will be longer term. Obviously recognize that flu could be a factor near term. Still variant of COVID here and there. But where do you think consumption ultimately ends? I mean does it get back to where it was? Does it stay above pre-COVID levels or does it end up getting back to where it was pre-COVID in your view? What are you planning for?
Matthew Farrell: Look, we were planning on expanding our capacity, right? We've got to put a pause on that. But we do think so long term, we're going to need that capacity.  The transition from pills and capsules to the gummies is a pretty important factor. So if you look at the percentage today, it's 27% of the total VMS category is gummies. And we expect that's going to continue in the future. And a lot of people discovered the category as a result of COVID. Yes, certainly, some people have exited, but not all.  So consequently, we think the future is still bright for the business, but we're going to have a kind of a rough ride here, at least for the next couple of quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: So just a few questions. First thing is just gross margin progression. I know, Rick, you mentioned it's likely a tailwind overall next year. But when I look at kind of this quarter, what's implied for 4Q and that you've talked about continued headwind, at least in the first half -- first half of the year, more or less, in some of the more discretionary businesses, it feels like that gross margin progression is still like getting back -- you're probably not inflecting to up until we get toward the second half of '23. I mean is that fair? Just again, given the mix dynamics that you've kind of called out on the discretionary side of the business.
Richard Dierker: Yes. I'm not ready to give quarterly or first half, second half guidance on 2023 yet. I would just say that we're kind of getting ahead of ourselves talking about 2023 at all, and so we were just trying to give broad brush strokes. And I would tell you the answer as of right now, our visibility is gross margin expands next year. And we'll get into all the details, all the bridges that you guys want to in February.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. And then I wanted to come back again on fill rates, which is -- it's a question of just kind of grappled with a couple of times already this year, really going back over the last 12-plus months. But fill rates have been improving, as you've said, and that's been an achievement. I understand categories where ability to supply, of course it makes sense to push on the string in terms of marketing. But you've also said out-of-stocks haven't been an issue. So I just still don't really understand why improving fill rates is a true tailwind to the business as we move forward. I mean, not saying that you didn't have to fix it and you did. But I just want to understand the tailwind to sales growth that should come from improving fill rates if out-of-stocks haven't been a problem.
Richard Dierker: Yes. I think it's -- Matt, I'm sure I have some comments, too. But overall, fill rates, we think, being at 98% means that -- for 2023 means that we're going to be able to match consumption all year long, that we're not going to be able to have to turn down promotions in certain areas, because that has happened this year. We've said as much as we would like to, we can't. And I'm not going to go through the different examples of that, but that exists. So that's kind of in the back of my mind when we're talking about fill.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And when we say out-of-stocks are a lot better and less of an issue, it's because we finally cracked the low 90s. But we still leave money on the table. The out-of-stocks being at 90% is not something we're proud of. And by the way, we still get it with retailer funds because of our inability to fill. So that's another drag that we have on our gross profit.  So we definitely do, in certain categories, have certain SKUs that are problems for us that are creating a drag on our organic sales, Lauren.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. And final thing was just the SG&A in the quarter. It was down a bunch, not terribly different than last quarter. But just anyway -- I'm sorry, than a year ago. But just curious on the levels of SG&A spending, if there's like an incentive comp reset we should be thinking about, but presumably that would come next year. But any color on the SG&A piece would be great, too.
Richard Dierker: Yes, I think that's kind of alluded to at last quarter, that we expected SG&A favorability. And fortunately it is because of incentive comp. When you have some of these recessionary pressures on discretionary items, it's dragging the whole company below some of the key metrics. And so I just answered Jason and said that our payout was tracking around 30%. And so that's a benefit in the quarter per se and for the year, not the one that we would want and that we'll have to get refunded next year.
Matthew Farrell: If you recall, Lauren, we have 4 targets annually, right? Sales, gross margin, EPS and cash. And the last 2, we got a 0 on. So that's what's affecting our incentive comp, as you well know, where our EPS is and our cash flow.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of Truist.
William Chappell: A couple of just clarifications, I guess, on Jason's and Lauren's questions. So I assume you accrued for variable comp in the first 2 quarters. Was there a reversal that give a bigger benefit in the third quarter? Or will it in the fourth quarter? Or is that not the way you look at it normally?
Richard Dierker: Yes, you always have to accrue kind of on a year-to-date basis, and we were tracking more favorably in Q1 and Q2. And then as some of these pressures like on inventory, for example, on these discretionary categories impacted cash flow, then we have to adjust the accrual and you get like some of the catch-up, year-to-date catch-up in the Q3 accrual, as an example. So yes, that's true.
Matthew Farrell: Yes, it's been coming down all year long though.
William Chappell: Okay. So there wasn't an outsized like benefit this quarter from the reversal or accrual.
Matthew Farrell: There was a benefit in Q2 and a benefit in Q3.
Richard Dierker: And a bigger benefit in Q3 as we -- as projections, for instance, comps have come down.
William Chappell: Got it. And then second, and just trying to couple the commentary on the vitamin business. I mean I understand -- I think you said it's starting to stabilize and it's really way up versus kind of 2019 levels, which I appreciate. But at the same point, you said you would put a pause on the CapEx expansion. Maybe it was -- you're lowering your CapEx by $100 million, and maybe that's too aggressive. But just trying to understand how to put those 2 together. If you think we're just getting back to normal, why would you kind of tape down CapEx expansion that would probably add capacity 2 years from now?
Richard Dierker: Yes. No, it's a fair question. The nuance is when we were doing all of our capital planning and demand forecasting 12 months ago, when we started that project, it was jumping off of a baseline of this new COVID behavior, assuming all this behavior is stuck and all this incremental, whatever, 50% increase from 2019 stuck, there's no decline. And so now that we're seeing a decline from that behavior, not all of it going back, but a decline from that behavior, we're just readjusting our baseline and growing from there. So when we do that, it doesn't mean that we're going to not do the capacity project, it just means we need to -- we can easily pause it for 12 to 18 months, and that's what we plan on doing.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. The other thing, too, Bill, is during COVID times, we had to go outside and get a third-party supplier. So we have more flex in our ability to supply today. So that gives us a little more flexibility with timing of the CapEx.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge.
Jonathan Feeney: I just wanted to follow up on earlier question about M&A. Obviously, congratulations on how you managed the balance sheet, particularly the, I think, 2.3% coupon , but marginal funding rates have changed a tremendous amount, as I guess, I would guess valuations have. So how -- maybe Rick or Matt, how do you think about M&A differently right now? Like have hurdle rates changed? How do we quantify that? And has it become on margin a better or worse environment for accretive M&A with those 2 valuations down and funding rates up?
Matthew Farrell: No, it's a great observation. We look at where the tenure is right now and where it's going and just to look at the change in commercial rates, it's more expensive to fund an acquisition. And we're focused on incremental cash earnings, and cash earnings is impacted by interest rates and interest expense. So yes, that would make it a higher hurdle as far as at least how we look at deals from a cash earnings standpoint.
Richard Dierker: Yes. And I would just add to that. I actually think it's a net-net positive though, like -- and it doesn't matter if the interest rate is 2%, 4%, 6%. A good business that we want to own and a brand that's going to be around for 50 years typically is going to generate a lot of cash earnings and most of the time, accretion as well. But for those people that are bidding against us, especially private equity, they could not handle 6% or 7% interest rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom of UBS.
Bryan Adams: This is Bryan Adams on for Peter. Sounds as though the updated guide doesn't assume things have gotten much worse incrementally in Europe. I know it's a smaller piece of the business. But I know it's fair to say some of that you were probably contemplating back in September. But I just wanted to get a mark-to-market on the business and how it's performing there and if you're seeing anything in terms of weakening on the part of the consumer since September.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. That's an insightful question. We are worried about the European consumer over the next 6 months and just focus on the effect of heating bills. I'm sure you've read about the government support to try to cover some of that. But just to give you an illustration, like our utility bills in our U.K. plant are up 80% year-over-year. So it is something to watch. It's something we've built into our Q4 look, but it is a concern. So it's a good observation, Bryan.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for any closing remarks.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we do look forward to talking to everybody about 2023. So thanks for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you all participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-29 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that this call -- that on this call the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Financial [ph] Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: So I got promoted as CEO about seven years ago, but anyway. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We got a lot to talk about. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick's done, we'll open the call for questions. So Q2 was a solid quarter for us. Reported revenue was up 4.2%. Organic sales grew 3.4%. And this was in line with our 3% to 4% outlook. The adjusted EPS was $0.76. Now this was $0.06 higher than our outlook, but that was due to lower marketing. We grew consumption in 11 of our 17 categories in which we compete and in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year. Fill rates have improved to 90% in June, and we expect to get back to historical levels by the end of the year. Regarding brand performance, we experienced double digit consumption growth in six of our 17 categories. And I'll name them for you. ARM & HAMMER scent boosters, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, ARM & HAMMER clumping litter, Batiste dry shampoo, ZICAM zinc supplements and TheraBreath mouthwash. And we gained share on eight of our 14 power brands. So that's a good story. Our shares are healthy. In Q2, online sales, as a percentage of total sales, was 16%. Our online sales increased to 15% year-over-year, and we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be up -- be above 15% as a percentage of sales. Since early 2021, we have announced price increases to combat inflation. And through mid-2022, we have already announced price increases covering 80% of our global portfolio. And we did a second round of price increases in Laundry and Litter that just hit the shelves. But at the same time cost inflation continues to climb. So since we spoke to you in April, we are now expecting $50 million of new incremental costs inflation. So the cumulative incremental cost inflation is $135 million since we gave our initial full year outlook way back in February. Now, the incremental $50 million of inflation, combined with currency headwinds caused us to lower our full year EPS outlook. We now expect 6% operating income growth offset by a much higher year-over-year tax rate. Now, I'm going to comment on each business. First up is US consumer business which grew organic sales by 2.4%. Looking at market shares, as I said before, we had good numbers, as eight of our 14 power brands gained share. Looking ahead, we expect even further improvement in our market share positions by year end, as our fill rates will improve and promotional and marketing spend increases in the back half. Let's look at a few of the important categories. Let's start with Laundry. The trade down to value detergent has begun. I’ll give you some numbers. For example, during Q2, the liquid laundry category grew 7%, but value laundry detergent grew 11%, while premium laundry grew 4%. In Litter, the category grew 12%, both our black box, which is premium and our yellow box, which is value had double digit consumption growth in Q2. The dry shampoo category, was up 18% in Q2, while Batiste consumption was up 43%. Our growth would have been higher if not for our difficulty in securing aerosol cans and actuators.  Over in Gummy Vitamins, the sequential quarterly growth of the category is slowing down. For the last three quarters, the category growth rate has been 16%, 10% and most recently, 5%. We expect the category growth to turn negative in Q3 Simply because we are lapping the consumption spike from the Delta variant in last year's Q3. And we continue to struggle with fill rate which is hampering our ability to grow. Our most recent acquisitions are performing well, TheraBreath which we acquired in December 2021 had a great quarter with 33% consumption growth. TheraBreath grew share of 3.1 points to 16.4% and of the alcohol-free mouthwash category. TheraBreath is the number two nonalcohol math wash and is solidly the number four brand in total mouthwash.  ZICAM is our other recent acquisition. ZICAM also delivered strong results this quarter. You may recall, we acquired ZICAM in December of 2020. We were hurt in year 1 of our ownership due to masking and social distancing. ZICAM cold remedy consumption was up 55% in Q2 and is the number one brand in the cold shortening segment with a 75% share. Now looking ahead to the rest of the year, the regular flu season in the US is projected to be more severe than recent years based on what the southern hemisphere is experiencing right now. Next up is international. Despite significant disruptions, our international business delivered organic growth of 6.5% in Q2, primarily driven by Batiste in Europe, Vitamins and Batiste in Canada and growth across the GMG business which is our export business. In April, when we spoke to you, we expected flattish growth in Q2 and a continuation of the supply chain lows we experienced in Q1, such as fill level issues and delivery issues. Those actually proved to be less disruptive in the quarter than we anticipated. However, fill levels and delivery issues will continue to weigh on our Global Markets Group in the near term. Next up is Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered a strong quarter with 6.3% organic growth, driven by both higher price and volume. Now I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing our more discretionary brands since they are having an impact on our full year revenue outlook. We see lower consumption for water flossers in the US as consumers trade down to lower press water flossers. Also the WATERPIK Asia-Pacific flosser consumption has and is expected to decline as a result of lockdowns.  Similarly, there is a lower demand for WATERPIK showerheads and this is due to less yourself projects, a lot of those got completed during COVID times. WATERPIK is a discretionary purchase, and we continue to invest in demand-driving activities such as launch and learn to drive household penetration of flosses.  It's fair to say gum health has not gone away and still only 16% of the US population flosses every day. Now this is a business that has averaged high single-digit growth top line, since we acquired them in 2017. And we're confident that the long-term growth prospects for WATERPIK are sound. The other discretionary brand we have is FLAWLESS. We're experiencing lower consumption, but that is largely due to the absence of our new products in this fast-moving beauty category. China lockdowns have impacted our manufacturing, and the new product launches that were planned for the first half have been delayed until the end of '22. Now, I want to spend a few minutes on the health of the consumer, private label trends, innovation and our ability to supply. Innovation is at a multi-decade high, and interest rates are rising to tamp down inflation. And while wages have risen, households are getting squeezed and the consumers are making choices to make their dollars go further. I think back to April during our Q1 call, we called out the strengthening value detergent segment. In the latest four weeks ended July 17, value liquid laundry detergent category is up 8%, deep value is up 1%, and premium is down 1%. So we think the trade down is happening. Here's another an early indicator of trade down, this time in oral care. We had one major retailer point to the strength of manual toothbrush, which has held up well for them in contrast to declines in rechargeable and power toothbrushes. This trend impacts both WATERPIK and SPINBRUSH, and here are a few numbers to illustrate the trend. The flosser category was down 7% in Q2. And battery-operated toothbrushes, the category was down 4% also in Q2. So we're keeping an eye on these and other trends. It's important to point out that 40% of our portfolio is value, and we expect to perform well in a difficult economic environment. Our largest businesses, detergent and vitamins, are value products. And in Litter, our orange box is also valued. So we feel well positioned for what may be coming. Now regarding private label. Private label shares are stable in the five categories where we have meaningful exposure to store brands. As you saw in the release, we have a strong lineup of innovation across our personal care and household categories. I want to highlight the early success of ARM & HAMMER Baby Laundry Detergent, which has already achieved a 10% share of the baby laundry category at Walmart. The other product I'd like to highlight is TROJAN RAW, which is the thinnest condom now in the market, which is already the number six out of 400 SKUs sold at Amazon. I also want to mention our recent launch of a new lightweight litter that we call Hard Ball. We expect, over time, this will enable us to get our fair share of the lightweight litter category. For the cat owners on the call today, we named it hard ball because of the hard ultracompact clumps. It's quite a unique consumer experience. Now regarding ability to supply, you may recall, we hit bottom in Q1 with the Omicron resurgence when we saw our fill rates dip below 80%. The overall Q2 fill rates improved to 89%, although recovery in our high-margin personal care side of the business is still lagging. We're on track to be near historical fill levels by the end of the year, and the good news is July continues to show improvement. We have confidence in our revised full year outlook for several reasons, improving fill rates, trade down to value, healthy new product innovation and consumption strength in our recent acquisitions. Regarding support, we have key promotional events lined up in the second half, and two-thirds of our full year advertising spend is concentrated in the second half. In closing, we expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times, and we continue to hunt for new TSR-accretive acquisitions. Next up is Rick to give you more details on Q2.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.76, flat to prior year. The $0.76 was better than our $0.70 outlook primarily due to continued strong consumer demand and lower marketing spend due to below normal fill rates in our personal care business. The market impact was about $0.04 in the quarter. Good news is our overall fill rate continued to show improvement and hit 89% for Q2. Reported revenue was up 4.2%, reflecting a 1% drag from currency. Organic sales were up 3.4%, in line with our outlook. Matt reviewed the top-line for the segment, so I will go right to gross margin for the company. Our second quarter gross margin was 41.2%, a 220 basis point decrease from a year ago. Let me walk you through the Q2 bridge. Gross margin was impacted by 600 basis points of higher manufacturing costs primarily related to commodity inflation, distribution and labor as well as a 10 basis point drag from currency. These costs were offset by a positive 270 basis point impact from price volume mix, positive 20 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 100 basis points from productivity. Moving to marketing. Marketing was down $14 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 7.8%, and we expect two-thirds of advertising to be concentrated in the second half as case fill improves. For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A decreased 10 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $15.1 million, a $3.7 million increase resulting from higher average debt outstanding. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.1% compared to 24% a year ago. And now to cash. For the first six months of 2022, cash from operating activities decreased 10% to $310 million due to lower cash earnings and higher working capital driven by higher inventory levels. We expect inventory to get back in line by year end. And as of June 30, cash on hand was $640 million. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 2% to 4%, organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 3% and gross margin contraction. Sequentially, we are decelerating from Q2 and as our VMS business comps to COVID surge a year ago, and we see a tightening in the consumer for our discretionary products such as WATERPIK and FLAWLESS. Those two reasons, coupled with the inventory issues we've all heard from retailers compressed Q3 growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.55 per share, a 19% decrease from last year's adjusted Q3 EPS. This is largely due to higher SG&A, which is normalized levels of incentive comp versus a year ago, plus higher marketing and promotional support. We expect higher EPS in Q4 to offset the Q3 decline driven by acceleration of organic growth in the absence of prior year onetime investment. And now to the full year. We now expect the full year outlook for reported sales growth to be approximately 4% to 6%, reflecting an incremental drag from currency of 1%. We now expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%. As you read in the release, we now expect an incremental $135 million of cost inflation for the year, which is $50 million higher than our April outlook. On a longer time horizon, we continue to plan on offsetting inflation with incremental pricing, laundry compaction, and productivity. We continue to anticipate full year reported gross margin to be down versus 2021 as inflation is partially offset by pricing and productivity. We continue to expect gross margin to improve sequentially in Q3 and increase year-over-year in Q4. Marketing spend is now expected to be lower in 2022 driven by the lower spend in the first half of the year. We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be flat to 2021 due to incremental inflation and currency headwinds. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be 23%. We expect cash from operations for the full year to be approximately $900 million, down from $920 million, and our full year CapEx plan is now approximately $180 million as we continue to expand manufacturing capacity. In closing, we continue to perform in a volatile environment. Our share performance improved again in Q2, and we expect further market share gains in the second half, as we invest in our brands and supply chain fill levels improve. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your question, please.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Two for me, if I could, Matt. So I think you've probably been a little bit more cautious on the consumer probably earlier than maybe some of your peers. Everyone got off practice call this morning. They're calling for a category slow down as well. So without asking you to be redundant, Matt, you called out some of your more discretionary categories. You're also calling it out in laundry maybe you could just talk about the scope and the exposure within your product portfolio in terms of where you expect to see further trade down and outside of what you called out. Maybe talk about the changing category growth rates underlying your -- underlying your guidance for the year? And then a follow-up. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: It’s a pretty broad question, Kevin. Yeah. As far as the categories go, let's start with discretionary. So I did mention that both the water flossers and FLAWLESS were both struggling due to trade down. Trade down for WATERPIK but also the absence of new products for FLAWLESS. But -- if you think about our portfolio, 90% of our portfolios are just our everyday essentials, only 10% that's related to discretionary products. So, we -- although we spend a lot of time talking about the discretionary products and because they do have it have had an impact on full year call, it's not the whole story. You have, I mentioned that we had growth in 11 out of our 17 categories that we're in, and we do expect that to continue in the second half. There are a few categories I call that besides of WATERPIK and FLAWLESS like Spin brush for example, rapid was down a little bit. As far as others -- and another one that was soft in the quarter depilatories and also oral gel, but everywhere else you know those categories you saw you saw growth.
Kevin Grundy: Yeah. My follow-up is probably is probably for Rick. Just in terms of the EPS outlook. The environment is clearly challenging costs have gotten worse FX not as a big headwind for your guys, but nevertheless still headwind, can you talk about the constraints on the pricing front? And then historically, it's well thought I've been run pretty lean, but other levers to pull here in terms of productivity to offset, offset some of the cost headwinds? And then I can pass it on. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Sure, Kevin. So, from EPS perspective, we've announced a second round of pricing as an example for laundry and litter that'll be a tailwind. Our personal care, fill levels returning from low 60s back to normal will be a tailwind. Promotional support because we didn't have the fill levels in the first half of the year to do promotions, like we normally would do in the back half. That's a tailwind. We think trade down is a tailwind in general in a laundry. Matt quoted some numbers on there about how will the value categories starting to grow and just that segment. So we think we're well positioned that for all those reasons for EPS. We also mentioned, Q3 is down big, but Q4 is up big and Q4 is also lapping some of those investments in one timer's that we’ve talked about previously. So that's an EPS side. On Productivity, we talked last quarter, I think Lauren asked the question about productivity phasing and that's so true because early on in this year and even late last year, it's hard to break in to get line time to go do qualification to do any productivity type efforts. And so we said it last quarter, it's still true. It's going to continue to build for the year. And as we have back at the right capacity and fill levels, then we'll have more and more time to devote to productivity at our plants.
Kevin Grundy: Okay very good. Thank you guys. Good luck.
Matt Farrell: Hey Kevin.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your question please.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess I just want to go back to the gummy vitamin category. So, you guys talked about slowing category growth. So, I was curious what's driving that lower category growth? And then secondarily, you mentioned that your fill rate is still being challenged. When do you expect your full rate to get back to where you'd like it to be?
Matt Farrell: We expect the fill rates to be back where it should be, which is in the mid to high 90s by the end of the year, Rupesh. Household is ahead of Personal Care right now. Of course, Personal Care is our higher-margin stuff. So, that's the one we're focused on the most right now.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Just to give you an example on that, Rupesh, right, we were in the low 60s on fill rate for Personal Care within the portfolio. In Q2, we had 74% in the month of July. So, we can -- we have visibility into rapidly improving that number.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And as far as the vitamins go, if you keep in mind, you've grown off really gigantic base in the last couple of years with growth in 2020 and 2021. So, although the growth rate is slowing down. It's because of the comps year-over-year, but last year Q3 was just a huge spike for -- in the quarter because of the Delta variant, Q3 of last year. So, consequently, that's a really tough comp and so consequentiality we expect it to go negative year-over-year.
Rick Dierker: Yes. As an example, Rupesh, Q3 last year, the category grew 33%. The rest of the quarters grew 19% Q1, Q2 and Q4. So, it's just -- it's more of a comp issue than--.
Matt Farrell: Yes.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the cost side, obviously, cost pressures continue. Just based on your visibility right now, like any sense the cost pressures could be peaking and maybe if you look forward to next year, some of these pressures could roll over? And then just maybe -- just more color on the risk that you see to your cost outlook for the balance of the year?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll leave you with two thoughts really. On the cost side, we do think there will be inflation next year. We think that inflation will only come down as demand comes down. And so if we enter into a recession, we think that demand will start to slow in general for the macro economy. So, we're -- usually, we would be, I don't know, 50% hedged from a commodity perspective for next year by now. We're not hedging at all as an example. Hopefully, that gives you some context.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Your question please.
Chris Carey: Hi, good morning everyone.
Matt Farrell: Hey Chris.
Chris Carey: Just -- maybe we could talk a bit more about the phasing for the year, Q3 versus Q4. I'm specifically trying to understand really the snapback that you're expecting in Q4 and what's driving that? And perhaps within that, you can comment on whether there are specific volume headwinds you expect to improve in Q4 versus Q3. Do you have specific promotional plans in Q3, which will not reoccur in Q4, is just really a call on the consumer trading down and that benefit accruing to you? So just trying to get some incremental context and really confidence on that recovery that you're expecting now in the Q4 relative to the Q3. And then I have a follow-up.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Okay. Well, there are a lot of factors influencing this. So for example, the fill level improvement, we're leaving money on the table in several categories. So we do think that once that gets fixed, particularly on the personal care side that we're going to benefit from that. And that's more back-end loaded to Q4 than Q3. It is true that we've got both trade and advertising in place for Q3 and Q4. We do think as the economy, the recession or what some people call a recession deepens that the trade down will continue and accelerate. So that's an element of it as well. So I mean, you're calling out the right levers with respect to the second half.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Let me give you some numbers to go with that. So our guide for Q3 organically is 1 to 3, which implies a 5% plus number in Q4. And so as Matt said, personal care fill levels are fully back. Promotional support's there. We think trade down is accelerating as well in Q4. So all those reasons we think organically, we're doing better. That helps EPS as well, of course. But we also have some higher inflation expectations in Q3, higher SG&A as we had some one-time catch-up year ago for incentive comp was a lot lower a year ago. And then we have higher tax in Q3 as well. So we believe both organically and from an EPS perspective, we have an inflection going from Q3 to Q4.
Chris Carey: Okay. Thank you. Then a quick follow-up would just be in Q2, price/mix was below our expectations, perhaps a bit below your expectations going into the quarter. I'd be curious your thoughts there. Despite what we're seeing as pretty strong pricing in consumption data, and so can you maybe provide some context on why that's happening? Did promotional activity accelerate heavier than you were expecting in the quarter, and now that's flowing into the back half of the year and perhaps that's why the organic is getting pulled down in addition to volume? Were there specific mix impacts that were a bit worse than you had been expecting? So really, what I'm trying to get a sense of is the Q2 price/mix key drivers and just how that's really informing your back half expectations. Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. It's pretty straightforward, Chris. No change really to our pricing aspect of it. That's all going well. We threw out another round of laundry and litter. That's going well, early days. We'll continue to evaluate whether we need to do incremental pricing as cost inflation happens. But Q1 to Q2, we decelerated from a price volume -- price/mix perspective from 7.8 in Q1 to 6.2. That entire deceleration is negative mix from WATERPIK. And what do I mean by that? I mean consumers trading down from a higher-priced unit to a lower-priced unit. So that's the entire delta right there. It inflects positively again in Q3 and Q4 for the company because of the next round of laundry and litter price increases.
Chris Carey: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Your question please.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thanks. First, I just want to follow-up on that and ask you to talk a little bit about your price/ mix expectations from here, given that you called out your two highest per unit categories as seeing the deceleration. How do you think about that going just overall for the slowdown period, the macro slowdown period, how you're thinking about price/mix? And then just broadly, if you could just comment about what you're seeing in terms of elasticities of demand, private label, as private label starts coming back, how that's impacting your view on trade down. It sounds like you're expecting some benefit from trade down, but do you see any risk that the lower end of your consumer base could potentially trade down as well? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yeah, I'll take the price/mix question. So first half, volume would be down 4%, and price/mix was up 7%. And that's how we got first half result of around 3%. We think the second half is down 3% on volume. That's really a slowdown in the discretionary stuff like WATERPIK Showerheads, for example, or FLAWLESS and offset by the value trade down and whatnot. Price/mix, on the other hand, is pretty consistent, 7% in the first half, 7% in the second half. And that's what I said before to Chris was really lower mix on WATERPIK is a -- as the trade down happens, therefore, is a negative, but then the positive is higher price on laundry and litter.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. And your question about the private label, as I said in my opening remarks, there's five categories where we compete with private label. And those private label shares have been largely stable. Only one that's moved up a little bit is litter. It's moved up about 1%. It's now 11.9%, but we haven't been interacting with private label in that category as opposed to some of our competitors. So that's why we feel confident that the private label is at least in the near-term, next six months, we don't expect that it's going to be a big issue for us. Does that help you, Olivia?
Olivia Tong: Yeah, that's perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Your question please.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Just specific, I guess, housekeeping-type things. One on kind of the cost environment in your hedges, historically, I thought you did some hedging on diesel costs. So I didn't know with the runoff of energy prices, the potential come back around energy prices, if you are locked in more or have some potential where that could be a relief in the back half? And then the second one, just on currency and FX exposure. Can you just remind us versus the euro, the peso, et cetera, kind of, what your exposure is, and what we should be looking for? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So I'll take the commodity one first. I think I said earlier, we have very limited hedges out for 2023. We entered this year, and I'd say we're about 80% hedged. Most of the cost inflation that we're talking about is primarily raw material impact, and that's coming through incremental discussions with third-party manufacturers. And it just takes a while for it to go through the supply chain. Our outlook this time versus last time is minimal on commodities, I would say. Of course, the diesel is up and -- but that is hedged to some degree. And ethylene is up, and that is hedged to some degree. So that's on the commodity side. On currency, a couple of comments on currency. For us, we're not that exposed to currency. We just called out the 1% drag on the top line, 1% drag on the bottom line. We don't, of course, hedge in translational. Transactionally, we hedge about 80% of our transactional exposures, whether that's the euro or the Canadian dollar.
Bill Chappell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Andrea Teixeira: Good morning and thank you. I was hoping if you can comment on the mix impacts on gross margin. You may see with VMS going negative in Q3 and possibly in Q4. I'm assuming that's a headwind. I just want to confirm. And also, are you seeing a down trade of that category from your brands into private label? And I do remember, you got away from some of the contracts in private label, so I was just double checking if it happens this down trade, as you mentioned, in some categories like laundry, that helps you. In this case, you may not be helped if you are no longer making private label for some of these customers. Just trying to clarify.
Matt Farrell: Andrea, this is Matt. Just with respect to private label, private label shares in vitamins are stable. So, we're not seeing growth in private label. The only one -- only of the five categories we compete in, it's only litter that had an uptick.
Rick Dierker: And you're right. We walked away from private label manufacturing for vitamins a couple of years ago, to get back into that. On gross margin mix, there's not much of a mix impact on vitamins, whether it grows or it decline from a revenue perspective. Just to talk about gross margin in aggregate, right? In Q1, we were down 190. In Q2, we said it was a lot like Q1 and it did, down 220. Q3, we're going to improve from -- a little bit from Q2, but it's not going to be the same improvement that we had thought previously. And then in Q4, we think we're going to inflect positive. And it's the same reasons why we talked about last time, personal care fill levels, productivity builds, round to pricing. And gross margin in Q4 last year was one of our lower quarters. So I know you didn't ask the detail on gross margin, Andrea, but I thought that would be helpful in context.
Andrea Teixeira: Super helpful. Thank you. I’ll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Your question please.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi guys. Quick question on inventory, just to make sure we heard it, I heard it correctly. So inventories are -- I guess inventories you need to work through a little bit. So should we assume that your results are going to lag what we see in terms of consumption for a little while? And then can you also maybe talk about what inventories look like at retail for -- particularly for WATERPIK and some of the discretionary items as -- discretionary items at retail, a series of other categories seem to be quite high.
Rick Dierker: Yeah. I think you saw in the release, we said we had to get back in line by year-end. And really, WATERPIK wasn't really because of consumption per se. It was more because we were trying to get ahead of the Chinese lockdown that happened. So we built up supply. And so yes, it takes a couple of quarters to work through that, especially as consumption comes in a little bit. But we think we'll be in a good spot by end of the year on that one. Similar answer on FLAWLESS. We think we're going to be in a good spot there as well. And then at retail, I think in-stock levels are good, especially for our household business. I think where we're still struggling is our personal care as our fill levels are lower than we like. But we think that we're going to recover pretty quick in the back half.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And you asked about WATERPIK as well on inventory at the on-shelf or at the retailers. Thing to kind of remind everybody is that WATERPIK, about half the flosser business is online. And so there isn't a lot of inventory that's really carried by the online class of trade. So we don't see there's an issue there with respect to WATERPIK inventories or softness in sales because of high inventories in the channel.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. And then following up on Olivia's question a little bit. I know you mentioned many, many times private label share has been flat. But if we can maybe just talk about that consumer and the value part of your portfolio and just from a consumption perspective, not trading down or trading up. I know you look to benefit from trading down. But are you seeing anything just in terms of consumption just with that consumer, isolating it to that consumer?
Matt Farrell: Are you specifically talking about vitamins?
Kaumil Gajrawala: No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm talking about the 40% of your portfolio that would be considered value. I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of that consumer. I know you're not seeing trading down, but maybe they're consuming less, buying less, clearing their pantries. Just curious what you're seeing.
Matt Farrell: Well, if you think about value detergent now, some of the numbers that I quoted just like in the last four-week period ended July 17 is that value laundry detergent is up 11%, and deep value is up 1%, and premium is a minus 1. So that's -- so we would say -- and by the way, there isn't a lot of private label in the laundry category, liquid laundry detergent. It's generally mid-tier. So it's higher priced than our brands. So that's not an issue when it comes to that category. In litter, the category grew like 11%, 12% in the quarter. We grew even faster. And it wasn't just our premium brand, our black box, [indiscernible] but our yellow box, which is the value grew double digit as well. There is litter private label. But as I said earlier, it's ticked up 1% to 11.9%, but we haven't interacted as much with the private label as some of our peers. The other big category would be vitamins, where it's stable. And just a few other ones just to mention is you have baking soda and also oral analgesics, which is Orajel. And again, the private label shares are pretty stable right now.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please
Stephen Powers: Hi, guys. Good morning. I just want to start going back to vitamins. I think your call on the third quarter is pretty clear, but where do you think that category goes, your business goes beyond 3Q? Number one. And then as you think about the fill rate improving in vitamins, is that more to be a function of your capacity improving? Or is it actually the category kind of comes back to you and alleviates the pressure through declines?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Hey, Steve, it's Rick. I think the back half of the category will be under pressure as it was elevated and really all of Q3 for the Delta spike last year and a little bit in Q4. So that's our view. Now remember, if you take a big step back, the category has more than doubled over the last two years or three years. So again, we're really happy with the vitamin category. In terms of fill levels for vitamins, they get better every single day. We really have two issues on two SKUs, and that's really driving the issue right now. And it's ingredient-related, and we finally worked through alternates. In the next 30 days or so, we should be back on vitamin fill.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And Steve, the other thing just to add to what Rick said, yes, we're super happy with the growth of the category over the last few year, but keep in mind that the other tailwind is the transition from pills and capsules to gummies. That's going to sustain the growth of the gummy category in the future. And of course, new ingredients and new product offering assist the other catalysts.
Stephen Powers: Yes. And you guys are value priced in the category, too.
Matt Farrell: Yes.
Stephen Powers: Okay. So then I wanted to pivot also 1.5 months ago, we talked a good deal about how your portfolio has evolved since 2009. And I thought you did a good job of underscoring how in fact there are still a lot of similarities today versus 2009 and your resiliency in terms of the 40% value exposure. I was at least reassured. I guess now I'm wondering if that was a bit of a false sense of security just given the fact that you've added discretionary categories. And I appreciate it's only 10% of the portfolio now, but it's obviously having an impact. So I'm curious, number one, just what your outlook is on those categories going forward? And what kind of drag this may be if the economy evolves the way that it seems like you're positioning for in 2023, number one. And number two, I'm wondering if it changes at all how you approach incremental M&A because a good deal of your M&A with FLAWLESS and WATERPIK has skewed to these discretionary categories of late. And just wondering if this experience changes that at all.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, we'll start with M&A. Our two most recent acquisitions were ZICAM in a couple of years ago in 2020, which got us into a cold shortening category, and then TheraBreath, which got us into mouthwash. So we continue to seek out everyday essentials. We're very happy with the WATERPIK acquisition. Of course, it's discretionary. It's a longer purchase cycle. But this business grew high single digits since we bought it in 2017. And long-term, it has terrific growth prospects. So for the long-term investor, this is a good brand to own. We've got a lot of opportunity outside the US. And yes, okay, we're going sideways right now, but keep in mind that the change in EPS is driven by cost and currency. And we've left money on the table in the first six months of the year because of our fill rates. If not for that, we'd be in far better shape. But it's water under the bridge. We do think by the end of the year, we'll have our fill rates back in line. We'll be growing from a smaller base with respect to WATERPIK, but we do think that once the economy settles down again, that will rekindle the growth of WATERPIK. And as far as acquisitions go, those acquisitions, WATERPIK met all of our criteria. We don't have a criteria that it's got to be -- that it can't be discretionary. But certainly, we are oriented towards buying everyday essential brands, and you can expect that from us in the future.
Stephen Powers: Okay. Thank you very much.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your question please.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to ask a little bit about pricing. I think when you spoke at recent conferences and even last quarter, you discussed that you thought, should you need incremental pricing beyond the July, increases you mentioned they would come more likely in the form of package size adjustments. So I was curious, A, if that's still the case? And then B, I think you'd also mentioned that those -- that, that approach would require some CapEx investment and some lead time to deal with tooling. And the CapEx guidance is a little -- it's small, but a little bit lower for this year. So, I was just curious how that kind of fits into pricing dynamics as you look ahead and anything you'd need on the CapEx side to implement those? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Hey Lauren, really from a pricing perspective, you're right. We said last quarter that primarily next year, we're focused on pack size versus pure price increases. Now of course, with new inflation and new news, we will react accordingly. And we'll see if we have to do any incremental price changes as well, right? So, I'd say it'd probably be both. On CapEx, it's immaterial to CapEx outlook on change parts for like a line, for a carton or for a new mold, for a bottle. So, it's a handful of million dollars or so, it's not that impactful.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. So relative to the comments previously about the CapEx, it was more about the time needed to implement rather than it being a cost.
Rick Dierker: Exactly right. It's more about 6 to 12 months in order to design a mold, cut a mold, to do a -- change parts, order the change parts for a line to do a different size carton. Those are the types of things that take time.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, I should say that.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey guys. So just a follow-up on that. On the incremental $50 million of cost pressure are there any plans to take incremental pricing or is it more productivity in the pack size changes? I guess, I just want to understand that incremental part. Obviously, there's always some timing lag. But is there concrete plans to take incremental pricing? And if not, I guess, why not?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I think right now, like we just said with Lauren, we're really focused on pack size changes and adjustments that way, which is effectively a price increase. We just think not as severe for a consumer. And then if inflation continues to go and we continue to chase the ball downhill, we'll evaluate doing incremental pricing.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. And then on the demand elasticity front, the volumes appear to reacting more to pricing than some of your CPG peers. But obviously, some of that may be more tied to supply. So just as you guys sort of parse through the consumer demand elasticity, so far in terms of what you're seeing at retail more than your shipments, can you give us an update on where you're coming in versus what you expected and if you've seen any sequential change recently on that front?
Rick Dierker: Yeah, I think you hit it on the head, Dara. In general, our comments wouldn't change from last quarter. We saw a 20% to 30% better than expected on elasticities for volume. The new laundry and litter price increases just went into effect a few weeks ago. So it's kind of too early to comment. But if there's any noise, it's usually because of fill levels, not because of price volume sensitivities.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. And then last, just in terms of price gaps, obviously, with a lot of substantial pricing and then more in July, are there any categories where price gaps have either expanded where you're premium or narrow where you value where you think they may have gotten out of whack with competitors. I'm just wondering if you can characterize the competitive environment on the pricing front relative to the pricing that you guys have realized?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Well, what I would say there is through the end of June, we were pretty happy with elasticities. Remember, we have new price increases that are just hitting shelf in July. That will be for both laundry and for litter. So that's the one we're going to watch now over the next quarter. And as far as the promotional environment goes, there was a pullback in Q2. If you look at liquid laundry, for example, the sold-on deal was around 31%. And that was down 60 or 70 basis points year-over-year. And there were some big pullbacks brand by brand. So the Purex was down 500 basis points year-over-year. We were down 340. So we pulled back because we were going through concentration, and others may be pulling back as a way to modulate price. And also in litter, litter's also a category that promotions are down again year-over-year. Sold-on deals around 11%. It's normally in the high teens. And then back to liquid laundry, about 31% sold-on deal. That's normally in the mid-30s. So the promotional environment has been pretty tepid so far year-to-date. And as for our most recent price increases, we're going to kind of watch the third quarter and see how they react with our peers.
Rick Dierker: And, Dara, I will say that, in general, we're happy with all of our price gaps. And even when we've led in a category, if you take a step back, then the category has also reacted. And so within a few months, all the price gaps are back to normal.
Dara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. One moment. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Jason English: Awesome. Thanks guys. I guess, I'm the closing act. Thanks for letting me in. I think, I heard you in the prepared remarks that you expect -- it may be in the press release, I don't know. It's all jumbled in my head at this point in time. But you have an anticipation of accelerating trade down in the fourth quarter. Which categories do you expect to benefit the most from that?
Matt Farrell: Well, laundry is the big one, where we expect that trade down. I'd say that's the big swinger. And we've already seen it. We started to see this. Remember, in Q1, what we said was that the previous several quarters that value detergent have been losing share to premium. That changed in Q1, and that held share versus premium. Q2, value starts growing faster than premium. And in the latest four weeks, value detergent is, like I said, is up significantly 11% versus the premium down 1%. So we do think that, that's going to accelerate. Now that could be muted a bit with our most recent price increases. And consequently, we have to see what happens with our competitors and where the timing of their price increases. But I think everything is going to be in place by the fourth quarter, many price increases that others have been contemplating. And yeah, we do have a fair amount of support, both advertising and trade behind our detergent in the second half. So that's the reason, the context for why we think things are going to accelerate.
Jason English: And P&G talked about laundry on its earnings call earlier. And they did reference marginally promotional activity, paper bath, but not to get more price, but because they hit a capacity ceiling that's now been resolved. And so they suggested that they're going to start leaning back in now. More advertising, more retail merchandising. If that transpires, how much or how many of that jeopardize your outlook and your expectations for the fourth quarter?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. You got to remember, Tide premium is twice the price of ARM & HAMMER. So I don't think that, that's as big a factor. Now yes, it's true that Tide Simply is still is around. That was not in place back in 2009 in the last recession. But up until our recent price increase, we had a significant price gap with Tide Simply. And we'll have to see what happens with their pricing in the second half, the pricing and trade.
Jason English: Yeah. Fair point. Thanks a lot guys. I’ll pass it on.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Matthew Farrell for any further remarks.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Okay. Well, look, it's a simple story, all right? Our reported now for the full year is 4% to 5%, organic 3% to 4%. And we did call down the EPS from 4% to flat. Why? Because 1% is currency, and the rest, the other 3% is cost. Shares are healthy. Fill rates are improving. Trade down is happening. And we've got big support in place for the second half, and we'll talk again with you at the end of October.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead sir.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open the call for questions. Q1 was a solid quarter for us. Reported revenue was up 4.7%, organic sales grew 2.7%, and we exceeded our 1% to 2% Q1 outlook for organic growth. The adjusted EPS was $0.83 and that's $0.08 better than our outlook. We grew consumption in 11 of the 17 categories in which we compete and in some cases on top of big consumption gains last year. This is remarkable as our low fill rates held back our consumption. The good news is April fill rates across many categories are now mid to high 80s and improving. Regarding brand performance our brands saw a double-digit consumption growth in seven of those categories and I'll name them for you. ARM & HAMMER Scent Boosters, ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, ARM & HAMMER Clumping Litter, BATISTE dry shampoo, WATERPIK, Water Flossers, ZICAM zinc supplements, and THERABREATH mouthwash. In Q1 online sales as a percentage of total sales was 16%. Our online sales increased 2.6% year-over-year. Now, keep in mind, this is on top of 53% growth in e-commerce that we experienced last year in Q1 versus 2020. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15% as a percentage of total sales. Now, since early 2021 we have announced price increases to combat inflation. And through early 2022, we had already announced price increases covering 80% of our global portfolio. Since we spoke to you last in January, we are now expecting $85 million of new incremental cost inflation. And as a result we recently announced another round of price increases on our Fabric Care and Litter products which will be effective in July of this year. In addition to pricing we are pursuing additional measures to offset higher-than-expected costs such as productivity and pack size changes. Also in laundry you may know we have now concentrated our portfolio by approximately 10%. Now, I'm going to talk about each business and first up is the Consumer business in the US. Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.7% and this is on top of 5.1% organic growth in Q1 of 2021. Looking at market shares in Q1, seven of our 14 power brands gained share. Our most recent acquisitions are performing well. THERABREATH, which we acquired in December of 2021, had a great quarter with 37% consumption growth. THERABREATH grew share of 3.6 points to 15% of the alcohol-free mouthwash category and Q1 was the first full quarter in which THERABREATH surpassed ACT as the fourth largest mouthwash brand and THERABREATH remains the number two alcohol-free mouthwash brand. Total distribution points or TDPs as we call them for the THERABREATH brand are up 20% versus a year ago. ZICAM also delivered strong results this quarter. You may recall we acquired ZICAM at December of 2020. We were hurt in year one of our ownership due to masking and social distancing. ZICAM cold remedy consumption was up 56% in Q1 and we expanded our share of the cold shortening segment to a little over 75% share. Turning to Gummy Vitamins. Total shipments of VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS were relatively flat in the quarter. Demand for gummies remained high as the category consumption grew 11% but our case fill was low. So, we left money on the table in Q1. The good news is our fill rates also in vitamins are finally starting to improve. Next up is International. Despite significant disruptions, our International business did deliver some organic growth in Q1 0.3%, primarily driven by STERIMAR, BATISTE, OXICLEAN, and VMS in the Global Markets Group. Lockdowns and transportation issues hurt our results. We have the orders we're just struggling to fill them. We expect our difficulties to abate in the second half in International. Next up is Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered a strong quarter with 9.2% organic growth driven by both higher pricing and volume. I want to spend a few minutes on the health of the consumer private label trends innovation and our ability to supply. Now, we all know that inflation is at a multi-decade high interest rates are rising to tamp down inflation. And while wages have risen households are getting squeezed and we expect consumers will start to make choices to make their dollars go further. We have seen Netflix lose subscribers, but here are a few indicators that we're seeing. First, consumption of value detergent was flat year-over-year in Q1 and this is after losing share to premium detergent for several quarters. Over in Cat Litter, our traditional ARM & HAMMER orange box Cat Litter which is a value product, grew faster than our premium ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter in Q1. Over in Personal Care, WATERPIK is seeing faster growth of lower priced price point models in the flosser business. And then in showerhead, showerhead category consumption is slowing which may be an indicator that consumers may be spending less on home improvement. Now, we're keeping an eye on these trends and we are prepared if categories become more promotional in the second half. It's important to point out that 40% of our portfolio is valued and we expect to perform well in a difficult economic environment. And just to remind everyone, our largest businesses -- larger detergent and vitamins are value products. And in litter, our orange box is also valued. So we feel well positioned for what may be coming. Now regarding private label. Private label shares are stable in the five categories, where we have meaningful exposure to store brands. As you saw in the release, we have a strong lineup of innovation across our personal care and household categories. Most of these new products are shipping in Q2 and we believe our consumer is always attracted to new and improved product offerings. Regarding our ability to supply, we hit bottom early in Q1 with the Omicron resurgence and we saw our fill rates dip below 80%. As I mentioned earlier, April fill rates are trending toward the mid-to-high 80s and we're on track to be at historical fill levels by the end of the year. So we have confidence in our full year outlook for several reasons. We have improving fill rates. We have new product innovation hitting the shelves by July 1. Two-thirds of our marketing spend is concentrated in the second half. We have the incremental impact of pricing and we have the positive effect of concentration consumption. So in closing, we expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and we continue to hunt for new TSR-accretive businesses. And next up, is Rick to give you more details on Q1.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.83, flat to prior year. The $0.83 was better than our $0.75 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand, driving higher-than-expected sales, as well as better gross margin than expected. Reported revenue was up 4.7% and organic sales were up 2.7%. Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 2.7% due to positive price/mix offset by lower volume. As anticipated, the discontinuation of WATERPIK Shower Club programs was a drag to organic growth. We also experienced some bumpiness in the month of March and continued into April due to the laundry concentration transition. Good news is we are through that now. Consumer International had flat organic sales in Q1 due to broad supply chain disruption and laundry portfolio decisions in Canada. And for our SPD business, organic sales increased 9.2% due to higher price mix and volume. Milk prices have increased throughout Q1 and are projected to level out as 2022 moves forward. Our first quarter gross margin was 42.6%, a 190 basis point decrease from a year ago. Let me walk you through the Q2 bridge. Gross margin was impacted by 550 basis points to higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodity inflation, distribution and labor, as well as a 10 basis point drag from currency. These costs were offset by a positive 270 basis point impact from price/volume mix, positive 30 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 70 basis points from productivity. Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $3 million year-over-year. Marketing expense, as a percentage of net sales was 7.9%. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A decreased 50 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all in was $14.5 million, a $2.9 million increase, resulting from higher average debt outstanding. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 23.2%, compared to 24.2% a year ago, a decrease of 100 basis points. We continue to expect the full year rate to be 23%. And now to cash. For the first three months of 2022, cash from operating activities increased 53% to $153 million due to improvements in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. We continue to expect cash from operations to be approximately $920 million for the full year. And as of March 31, cash on hand was $174 million. Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $200 million, as we continue to expand manufacturing capacity, focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. For Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 5% to 6% and organic sales growth of approximately 3% to 4%. This is sequentially higher from Q1, as we expect an improvement in case fill levels after seeing April trend up into the mid-to-high 80s. We expect Q2 gross margin to contract 200 basis points, as we continue to experience higher inflation ahead of the latest round of price increases. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.70 per share, an 8% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. This means our first half earnings will be down approximately 4% consistent with what our outlook was in January. And now for the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year reported sales growth to be approximately 5% to 8% and organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 6%. As you read in the release, we announced back an incremental $85 million of cost inflation, compared to our original outlook. We're planning on incremental pricing laundry compaction and productivity to help offset. We continue to expect 10%-plus operating income growth to offset a 320 basis point increase in the effective rate -- effective tax rate. We continue to expect full year EPS in the range of 4% to 8%. However, we now expect to be at the low end of the range. And with that Matt and I would be happy to take any questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Good morning, guys. Hey, Matt, maybe just start on international. You talked a little bit about some of the supply chain issues you guys are contending with and you sound pretty optimistic that that will recover in the back half. We haven't been – the business has been so good now for a number of years. We just haven't been accustomed to seeing that. Maybe just walk through the issues in a little bit more detail. I think you mentioned lockdown. We haven't talked about China in a while, but I think that's a smaller part of your International business. Maybe just get a little bit more granularity on the International business in the quarter and your confidence for the balance of the year?
Matt Farrell: Yes. So we had a 0.3% organic growth in Q1. It won't be much better by the way in Q2. So we expect it's going to be back-end loaded starting in Q3. And yes, we said in our remarks that we have lockdowns we're dealing with in International. And the bigger problem actually is deliveries just getting product to deliveries. And this is especially prevalent in the GMG business, Global Markets Group. The Global Markets Group has grown significantly over the past five to six years and now it's one-third of International and it has been the fastest growing. And that part of the business has been growing 15% annually. So when that one slows down it affects the entire business. The important thing to keep in mind is we have the orders. We are just struggling to fill them either due to production problems or transportation issues. But we do expect those to continue in Q2 but be behind us in the second half.
Kevin Grundy: Got it – yes go ahead I'm sorry.
Rick Dierker: One thing to add to that. That business is really supplies from different countries exported from the US for example. And as our fill rates in the US improve that's going to of course improve the fill rates internationally.
Kevin Grundy: Got it. Got it. Thanks, Rick. Just one more follow-up for both of you. Just on the elasticities, I think broadly it's not lost on you guys for a moment what we're seeing in the data and what we're hearing from others in staple so far. Maybe just comment on what you're seeing there and what's embedded really in the balance of your guidance for the remainder of the year? And then Matt just broadly, any hesitancy to take further pricing in your categories just sort of worry around the state of the consumer. And I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys.
Rick Dierker: Yes I'll take the first one Kevin and Matt can take the second. Really on pricing, we've seen and this is what I said last quarter about a 20% to 30% impact better than we expected on elasticities for volume. We've continued to see that overall I would say and as we transition to the year of course now everyone talks about the consumer and the health of the consumer. And as Matt laid out in his prepared remarks, we've – we have assumptions as our fill levels gets back to normal. Our trade spending gets back to normal. Our marketing is two-thirds, one-third loaded in the back half. We have concentration hitting shelves now and will be there in the back half. And so there's a lot of things as tailwinds for the back half of our staple. But I'll let Matt talk more about the consumer.
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as pricing goes Kevin, your question is do we see further pricing in the future. Is that right? 
Kevin Grundy: Yes – it's twofold. It's sort of state of the consumer, demand, elasticity in general what you guys are seeing Matt and what you're embedding? And then related to that and sorry for being a bit propose, the inflationary environment start to give you any cause to push hard you announced additional pricing in some of your categories. Any more reluctant to do that now than you were even six to nine months ago?
Matt Farrell: Well look, monthly savings rates are back to pre-pandemic levels. We know there's significant inflation and the wage increases haven't necessarily caught up with inflation. It's $80 to get a tank of gas. The household balance sheets are thought to be strong because of accumulated savings. But as I said in my prepared remarks there are definitely indicators that would suggest the consumer is becoming more cautious right now. So if there is a downturn, we think we're well positioned because of our value products. Of course the other thing we have going for us is we have number one and number two brands. To give you some color on price we did take price on laundry detergent in mid-2021 and those were high single-digits. And we've seen others take price as well in large – Henkel for example, across all Sun and Purex, they've taken price increases of high single-digits to mid-teens. And even P&G for Tide Gain and Tide Simply is up 6% to 10%. And we're a value product. So given the most recent tranche of inflation, we're taking another step-up, which we will quantify that until we see again in July. So that's the story on laundry and litter. Our first round we took a high single-digit and we're taking another round right now. Nestlé with Tidy Cat, they've already taken two rounds of price increases and that's amounted to about 20% up and Clorox recently bumped up Fresh Step by high single digits. So -- and then if you went over to vitamins, we raised prices low teens and we're valued in vitamins. So we have more room because we're historically the value gummy but competitors going up right now as well 6% to 10%. So it's happening broadly. So we do watch what the competitors are doing as Rick said the elasticities have been too bad. But we think we're done for now with respect to pricing. We've had a couple of rounds in laundry and litter. We've done something in vitamins and we've done -- made surgical strikes in all the other categories. And because we have our -- the split between premium and value 60-40, we think we're in good shape whatever comes. 
Kevin Grundy: Got it thanks for the color, guys. Good luck. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Your line is open. 
Bill Chappel : Thanks – Hi, good morning. I guess first on back on kind of the guidance. I guess the surprise is just that you're tempering the EPS this early in the year when most of your peers reporting are I guess maybe you would view as the hope trade that everything will recover in the second half. Kind of just help us understand like what were the major drivers of that thought process? Was it the recession? Was it international? Was it just want to be conservative without knowing all the details, yet? I'm just trying to understand -- because where you see you kind of guiding down in the second quarter, which is not always guiding down for the full year.
Matt Farrell: Is that a multiple choice question Bill? 
Bill Chappel : Yes. Take C. 
Rick Dierker: Well. Hi, Bill, it's Rick. I'll take a -- it's relatively straightforward, right? We didn't change our revenue outlook range at all. So we still feel like overall net health of the annual consumption is strong. And as we improve our pricing, we have the ability to land anywhere within that range. So from a revenue perspective that's true international that's true. Orders fill will get better and international will get better as well. So the top line I would put that in a sound space but primary reason we adjusted the EPS outlook was because of inflation $85 million of inflation. And whereas before a quarter ago I said, hey -- online in the back half for resin ethylene and we think that it's going to be down anywhere between nine 9% to 10%. We just said you know what, we just saw the biggest spike in one month in our full year forecast that we've probably seen in the last couple of years. And we're now assuming spot rates at the end of March all the way through the end of the year. Now could that come down, because demand comes down because of other macro things? Yes but that's what we're assuming now. 
Bill Chappel : Okay. Now that helps for the color. Just one more on that like with that on the top line is you've added price increases. So presumably that would raise your top line outlook. Are you expecting some more elasticity that kind of brings it back to maintain, or is there -- it's not that scientific? 
Rick Dierker: Well two things. One, we continue to be conservative just because we've seen 20% to 30% improvement it doesn't mean that's how we're necessarily going to forecast on a go-forward basis especially with everything happening with the macro. And we have a big range in revenue really. But for the easy way to think of it right now is yes pricing went up by a couple of points and then volume would come down by a couple of points. And that's why we stay in that range we had before. 
Bill Chappel : Got it. Last one for me. THERABREATH would you expect TDPs to go up again further in 2Q as the resets happen? I mean it seems to be pretty widely distributed over the past three months but I assume, there's still some resets to go. 
Matt Farrell: We got a lot of them behind us already. They were a little bit better than we actually expected. But we do think that this brand is going to be a big grower for us in the 2023 2024 2025 Bill with additional distribution over time. 
Bill Chappel: Thanks so much
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. So just to follow up a bit on Kevin and Bill's question. The volume was a bit weaker than we expected in the quarter and I think consensus also. So just wanted to get your perspective on that particularly the 6% decline in the US and Consumer Domestic because you sounded still pretty enthusiastic about the retail takeaway. Is that more sort of supply chain-related? Are you seeing any more consumer demand elasticity, as you move through the quarter in March or maybe so far in April? I just love a bit of perspective there on sort of the supply chain and availability issues relative to any elasticity you're seeing and thoughts on that front? 
Rick Dierker: Hi, Dara, it's Rick. I think the easy one is in Q1, we expected volume to be down about 4% and it came down minus 5%. And that was all due to our laundry transition, right? We compacted our laundry business about 10%. And what does that mean? It means we had to replace all 150-plus SKUs of one size to another size. And when you have tight inventory there was some bumpiness in March. And so we had less than optimal fill levels for the period of March and April. And the good news is we've recovered on that now. So -- but that's what you're seeing in terms of the expectation is that's why we're slightly worse on volume.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. And you may remember Dara in my prepared remarks we hit rock bottom in Q1 with fill rates with the Omicron resurge. And we had more people calling out for COVID in one month than we had the prior two years.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on retailer relationships in the US. You guys have done a great job over time expanding shelf space. You're putting through a second round of increases now in a couple of categories this summer. You've had supply chain issues. So any issues in terms of retailer relationships, and how that impacts shelf space going forward? Obviously it's sort of a unique environment and a lot of competitors are taking a lot of pricing, but just curious for your perspective there. And just any thoughts beyond the categories you announced today for the summer on the rest of the portfolio if there could be pricing at some point and just how you guys think about that? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as retailers go from the beginning of the pandemic, we've been palms up and very transparent with the retailers with respect to all of our difficulties in the category by category. So I would say our relationship with our retailers is good right now. And the price increases have not tarnished or impaired that relationship. Like I said our most recent one is being sold through right now laundry and litter we expect that to go well. But I would say our commercial team would say we're in good shape as far as the relationships with the retailers.
Rick Dierker: And then with your pricing question right after this next tranche that Matt just alluded to that's going to be really effective in July or so. You'll probably see more to the pack sizes versus pure price increases from us, but we'll see and we'll adapt to the environment.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay, great. And then any thoughts on shelf space in the balance of the year and where you stand in the US, how we should think about that?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. No, I mean I talked to our Head of Sales this morning and we've got a lot of new distribution coming in, in 2022 notably in laundry detergent with the baby product that we just launched is incremental. So we're going to spreading that on shelf. So, yeah, we -- it's one of the reasons why we feel confident about the year.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess just on the gross margin line Rick, any more specificity you can provide in the magnitude of the gross margin decline you're expecting for the full year? And then do you still expect to exit the year with positive gross margins?
Rick Dierker: Yeah. No great question Rupesh. So we just said we are -- and in our original outlook contract and that's kind of what we reemphasize today contract. So I'm not going to give you an order of magnitude. I would just say that, yes, we expect improvement. Q1 and Q2 are going to look similar but then we're going to expect an improvement as we go through the entire year and we expect to be positive as we exit the year in Q4, largely because of pricing concentration, supply chains back in stock right -- supply chains back in stock and fill levels we have fewer trucks. We're very inefficient still in Q1. And then productivity build throughout the year as well. So that's why we think we're going to be in a good spot as we exit the year.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then I guess my second question. So I think in your press release you guys expect supply chain issues to be in the back half of 2022 for the most of your brands. Why wouldn't it be for all of your brands? Like I guess what headwinds do you still expect to have later in this year entering 2023?
Rick Dierker: No, we -- I mean that's just a wording in the release, we expect to really kind of be at pre-COVID type levels by the end of the year.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then maybe kind of the last question. Just on organic growth. Do you have updated organic growth expectations by segment?
Rick Dierker: No change. Since our outlook in January our company outlook is the same and there's no change to the three pieces.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Rick Dierker: Hey Jason.
Jason English: Hey, good morning folks. Thanks for letting me in. So you mentioned that you're off the bottom in terms of supply chain constraints. It sounds like you kind of worked through a lot of that earlier in the quarter, and it sequentially improved through the quarter. But when we look at the Nielsen data, it's almost the inverse. Like as the quarters progressed your volume trends eroded and the most recent data point is probably the weakest we've seen in a very long time. Can you unpack that a little bit? Like what's the difference of why we're seeing the volume trends erode later when you're narrative in terms of supply constraints suggests that it should actually be going the other way?
Rick Dierker: Yeah, sure. Hi, Jason, it's Rick. I don't know if I answered it for Dara or not but it really has to do with laundry, right? Our volume guide for the quarter was down 4%. We really came in down 5%. And I would have said we would have beat our volume guide. We had the orders for it. But as we go through this transition of 10% compacted for laundry all these new bottles and against 150 SKUs. As that goes up and the other 150 has to come out then the execution was not flawless, because there's a lot of complexity. When you think of a new product and you're slotting in two or three SKUs and typically a retailer that's no problem with that every day. But when you're talking about 150 SKUs, we couldn't build the inventory that we wanted. And so we had hard cutoff dates. And so we were out of stock more than we would want in our laundry business, in March and even in some in April. And so that's why you see that kind of nuance that, as supply is recovering. And we're fully recovered we're at 90% fill levels on laundry for example this week. But as we went through that bumpiness that's why you have out of stocks at laundry one of our biggest businesses for a period of I don't know three or four weeks.
Jason English: And did you go in isolation, or is the rest of the category compacted a comparable magnitude at the same time?
Rick Dierker: Yeah. No we mentioned maybe six months ago that a lot of the competitors had moved previously already, anywhere between 9%. And I don't know 13%. And so we lagged that move, but we've moved and this is big step for us 10% and we may do more in the future.
Jason English: So you've had a relative price value advantage over them for the last number of months, and now that advantage is fading. And there's always been a concern like if you go in isolation you shrink your bottle same price like it's a perception a price perception. Given that you're going out of sequence now how are you assessing the risk that the consumers now perceive you to be a less attractive value and you lose volume or market share as a result?
Matt Farrell: I think the way to think about it, is maybe there was an advantage, but we've turned to historical gaps as a result of our concentration. So we don't think that's going to be an issue. Keep in mind that I called out some of the price increases that the competitors have taken like Henkel has gone up high-single digits to mid-teens. So there's a lot of movement in the category right now. So I don't think it's going to change the relationships or the consumers' perception of value.
Jason English: Got it. Understood. Thanks a lot guys. I'll pass it on.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Chris Carey: Hi guys. How are you?
Matt Farrell: Hey.
Chris Carey: So just one question just around, price versus volume just being a bit more specific, I guess if I just think about the pricing that you've already announced and from the new pricing coming through it would suggest that maybe you're in the 5% pricing range in Q2 and so embedding volume elasticity is that fair? And then, similarly for the full year, it seems pricing is going to shake out at least in that 6% range. So again embedding volume elasticity or otherwise. And I guess -- is that a fair characterization? And then, secondly, is just how much of this is pure elasticity as the recovery in the supply chain as laundry is still catching up? And so I'm just trying to frame those competing dynamics.
Rick Dierker: Yeah. No problem, Chris. This is Rick. I'll just refresh your memory on what we said previously. I won't get into the quarter, but I'll talk about the full year. We had said -- I had said previously we thought volume was minus one and price was plus 5.5 and that's how we got to the midpoint of our revenue range of 4.5 organically. And now I would probably say, it's closer to minus three on volume and plus seven or so on price. And it's -- the volume piece is of course the new pricing the elasticities for Fabric Care and Litter. And then, also Matt alluded to it in his comments, the DIY shopper foot traffic some of those hardware stores are down by about 10% or 12%. So we think that the Shower Heads business and WATERPIK will be down as well. So that's how we get to the volume of minus three. And then on the price of course the pricing is up because of those actions we've taken and also favorable mix. Our personal care portfolio the THERABREATH a lot of the brands in the portfolio for personal care are doing well.
Chris Carey: That's very helpful. Then just one follow-up on, the prior line of questioning just around gross margins, clearly inflation tracking worse maybe 400, 500 basis points for the full year and gross margin is expected to rebound in Q4. I think that all makes sense. How does productivity factor into the equation this year? And are there opportunities to perhaps accelerate the amount of savings that you're getting or just given the tight supply chain environment is that just going to be a more difficult thing to accomplish this year? Thanks a lot.
Rick Dierker: Yeah. I would just say on the productivity front, it builds throughout the year. And the reason it builds is because, remember during all those key COVID times, and just really tight capacity times, we were unable to get line trials the plants to run some of these productivity projects. And as our capacity increases because our throughput is improved and our case members rise we'll have more time to do some of those qualifications. And that's why it builds throughout the year.
Chris Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong: Great, thank you. I just want to follow-up on a couple of things. First in terms of the supply chain constraints you talked about incremental pricing in laundry and litter. On an annualized basis is that -- how much of the cost inflation that you mentioned, does it, gets covered by that pricing? And then since those were some of the first categories to go last year should we be thinking that at current levels, you'll be evaluating sort of the same playbook as last year, as different pricing maneuvers lap, or is this pricing that you're planning to take right now and not for the inflation forecast that you already see combined with the productivity initiatives that you updated us on?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So let me try to answer both of those. So first of all, your first question was really how does our litter and laundry pricing recover versus inflation. And I would just say, we took a big step back and we've looked at really the two years of inflation since COVID started. And the good news is, this next price increase the 80% that we did plus this next tranche. As we exit the year we will have recovered through pricing and productivity all the cost inflation largely. So that's good news. What was your second question Olivia? 
Olivia Tong: Yes, just around the cadence of potentially more price increases because laundry and litter were the first to go last year. Should we assume that as the year progresses then you'll continue to evaluate more pricing with respect to the categories -- the rest of the categories that went as the year progressed? 
Rick Dierker: Yes. That all depends on the consumer and the macro environment as well. But I think what we both said earlier was, these two price increases are underway. And then we're also going to look at different pack sizes and other forms and move just list price increases unless there's another shoe that drops on inflation again.
Olivia Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then just in terms of this quarter 8% pricing in total 9% in consumer that's obviously pretty unprecedented as far back as my model goes. So, realize of course that we're also experiencing unprecedented levels of inflation. Those numbers are pretty big. And given that you were able to achieve that, I'm kind of curious how that might influence your future plans on pricing. Does it make you more optimistic about your price elasticities longer term, or do you just kind of talk this up more to the macros of a still relatively healthy consumer environment tight capacity all these things that are playing a part? 
Rick Dierker: Yes. You're talking about 9% price increases on average, but you're also talking about 9% of COGS inflation a year ago and that's our new outlook for this year as well. So big, big numbers of price because there's unprecedented levels of inflation. I don't think it would give us any more confidence in the future. It's great that when we price and our brands are number one or two, we've been able to do that and it's been relatively straightforward, but the entire ocean has kind of risen because of this global macro inflation and all competitors everywhere and every category are taking price. 
Olivia Tong: Got it. And then just lastly in terms of some of the international supply chain issues like what's happening to the business that you lost? Is it going to other players or just consumers sort of less -- more depleted in terms of their inventory or are they just pulling consumption? Just kind of curious what's happening to that lost sale? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. No there's definitely some lost sales and in some cases, you can lose shelf space. Remember and particularly in our Global Markets Group we're dependent upon distributors to interface with the retailers. But it's -- we have very strong distributors in many countries. So, we think once we get back in supply these two quarters are not going to hurt us long term. 
Olivia Tong: Got it. Thank you so much.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So following up on inflation, I thought you were 60% hedged heading into the quarter. And I believe you – obviously, it makes us saying like the $85 million additional inflation hits your 40%. As you roll the hedges how we should be thinking longer term. So that means that, you have to take additional pricing for the remainder 60% that was hedged as you go into '23? And then just as a fine point on clarification on the pricing in laundry and also in the litter side. So, you said -- I think you said high single digits at the time, mid last year in laundry and then would we expect a similar magnitude early now in June, or you're just using the concentration of compaction to help you most of that, or it's both? And then can you also update on the litter side please? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. I'll take the -- your second question first. We're only – Andrea, we're only communicating that price increase right now to the retailers so that exercise is not complete. So we won't be updating everybody on the magnitude of the price increase for laundry and litter until we talk to you in July. 
Rick Dierker: Yes. And then on your comment on the hedge, yes you're right we were 60% hedged within the year. A lot of this is diesel and -- diesel costs and oil-based inputs that we have that flow through other raw materials as an example. So those specific -- we do at times have hedged diesel. We just have not hedged a lot of diesel in 2022. So a lot of that diesel -- very quickly and then all the derivative products of oil that go through the supply chain. So that's really the basis of that. 
Andrea Teixeira: And just as a follow-up is that also the third-party manufacturing that obviously has a trickle down and a pass-through? And to that end the service levels I understand obviously, you had to shift all these 150 SKUs. And is that -- the service level as you exit the quarter improved? So can you update us on the service levels as you expected? And then how you should be feeling and that's the reason why you probably feeling confident that you can keep that top line and obviously increase the top line range? 
Rick Dierker: Yes, you're right. Those costs would also include third-party manufacturing costs that are especially for the raw materials components that they would have to have. So that's our best guess for the full year impact of that. And then fill levels Matt said in his remarks that in Q2 was our bottom quarter for the last seven or eight quarters. So we hit below 80%. And that was a bumpy transition for laundry, but it was also as Matt said in one month we had more out of -- labor issues than we had in many quarters last year. So the net of it though is I think to end on a positive is we are hitting mid to high 80s for the month of April. And in some key brands we're hitting in the 90s again already. So we have a lot of optimism. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel and that's why we're calling the back half of being recovered from a supply chain perspective. 
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. I will pass it on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. One question was a clarifying question because in the release it pretty explicitly says that the volume performance was a combination of supply chain effects and also elasticity. But then I feel like in your commentary there's a lot less around elasticity at least in the current quarter. So I was just hoping to get some clarification on that point? And then secondly, expectation that promotional levels normalize in the back half of the year. I'm just curious why are you thinking about that in terms of frequency depth both? Because I don't feel like that's something we're hearing from any other household product companies just given the inflationary environment, of course. So I was curious on your perspective on that point. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay. I'll take the promotional environment first. Right now Lauren, we should really be talking about household products because personal care products are generally not heavily promoted. So if we look at laundry detergent and where it is right now if you look at say liquid laundry detergent. The sold-on deal is around 31%, 32%. And normally it's in the mid-30s. So it's off the historical levels. And if you look at on a brand basis the kind of -- the value brands are sort of tightly bunched. Arm & Hammer, Purex, Tide Simply. They're all 24%, 25%, 26% sold on deal. So the big promoters is Tide. It's over 42 - it's 42% actually. And there were lower promotions frankly for a while now primarily due to supply shortages. And as you point out the introduction of price increases. So you're right it may not return to historical levels this year. But if it does we're prepared for it. And Rick anything you want to add to take on that first question? 
Rick Dierker: No, nothing else to add on that one. But on the volume question you had Lauren, I think it's just a combination. And, of course there's always volume implications to rise in price and harder to measure these days with all the different attributes going on with supply, demand, competition, lags on when pricing happens all those things. But we think there are two contributors to the quarter. We think it was the pricing elasticities and we think supply chain and I walked through some of the laundry bumpiness as well. So the good news is as we go through the year we hope that the supply chain stuff is improving and then we're left with really just purely some of the price elasticity on the volume side. 
Matt Farrell: And Lauren, I can give you a little more color too on the household just talking about litter. So if you look at litter sold on deal right now it's around 10% and it's typically in the high teens. And -- well everybody had problems in Q1 Clorox, Nestle, Church & Dwight as far as supply so intermittent out of stocks. So again low promotion. So yes it will probably be a slow roll for that to come back for the remainder of the year but as I said before if it does we'll be prepared. 
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. So just again to clarify in the quarter itself not the forward look, but in Q1 in what businesses have you already seen elasticity? 
Rick Dierker: Everywhere we raise price we have seen elasticity negative impacts on volume. We -- our comment has been those negative elasticities that were historical. I'm going to make it up for a second. If laundry, we say we raised price by 1% we expect volume to decline by 1%. In context of that we've said our elasticities have been 20% to 30% better than we expected. So that would mean that if price was up by 1%. In context of that we've said, our elasticities have been 20% to 30% better than we expected. So that would mean that, if price was up by 1%, our volume would be down by 0.8% of it, okay? So I would just say in every case, we've raised price, we have seen negative volume elasticity, but they've been better than we expected.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. All right. Thank you for the clarification.
Rick Dierker: Yes. All right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Powers : Hey, guys, good morning. Just on the supply from just a bigger picture perspective. Obviously, multiple factors in place in different parts of the business and the world and everybody had production transportation issues. But it just feels like you guys were early in terms of calling out the materiality of supply issues going back round about a year. And to some extent, I think the impact at least my perspective is they've been a little bit more severe. You've been talking about leaving money on the table for multiple quarters now. So I guess just the question is acknowledging your optimism over the balance of the year just, has it caused you to rethink at all the balance of in-house versus third parties, or just your diversification of suppliers and force to contemplate any change as you go forward, or are you kind of holding path on the supply chain structure as it exists? 
Matt Farrell: No, yes, that's a good question, Steve. We've made major changes in our supply chain. And what we're trying to do right now is have a shorter more resilient supply chain. And if you talk to our folks in supply chain, you'll hear that we've qualified dozens and dozens of new co-packers and suppliers, so that we have -- across the system, because there's no telling whether or not there's -- someday there's going to be another pandemic or some other black swan event. So, we said we got to be prepared for that. And it's created just a ton of work for our teams over the past couple of years. But -- when we come out of this, we're going to feel like we're even more resilient than we were going in. So it did definitely expose some of the weaknesses in our structure, which we've now cured in the last 18 months. 
Rick Dierker: And just to add to that, most of these issues that we have isn't because we outsource a lot of our finished good third-party manufacturers. Most of this is because we've had one or two raw -- key raw material supplier or we haven't been fully vertically integrated for example. But the good news is all those choices and decisions were made 12 months ago to adjust and improve. And so we're seeing every month now more and more of these coming online. So again, that's why our fill rates are improving so rapidly in April and that's why we expect it to continue.
Steve Powers : Okay. That's great. Yes. So the changes -- the kind of the strengthening of the overall supply chain that redundancy has been built kind of in real time as you correct the here and now issues. And so when things are back online you should also have that redundancy back online and the business -- the whole system should be stronger into 2023. I think that's my takeaway. Is that fair?
Matt Farrell: Yes. That was the goal when we started and that's where we're going to land, Steve.
Steve Powers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you both.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.
Matt Farrell: Hi, Peter.
Peter Grom: Hey, good morning. Hey, good morning everyone. Hope you are doing well? So I just wanted to ask specifically about the 2Q organic revenue guidance. And maybe I missed this, but did you discuss volume versus price mix in that outlook? And then Matt, I know you discussed some of the recent trends in value detergent, cat litter, shower heads, et cetera, that I guess led to some of the comments in the release around the portfolio's performance during a recession, I guess. But just wondering if you could comment as to whether you saw an acceleration of these trends as you exited the quarter and through April that is giving you a bit more concern versus maybe earlier in the year, or has it been largely stable throughout the quarter?
Matt Farrell: No. I would say, our remarks about what we're seeing with -- just to remind you, we still -- value detergent had been losing ground to premium for many quarters and then in Q1, so this is recent. It's now kind of flattish. And the trends we saw are Q1 trends with our orange box in litter, which is value is now moving faster than our black box, which is premium and that's a reversal of the prior trends. So, yes, I mean the commentary is recent and we're generally very transparent on these calls, we'll tell you what we're seeing. And that does influence our thinking with respect to what went may be ahead. Now is it -- could it be just we're going to have a few months where people are now traveling more and spending more money on experiences versus products. Yes, that could be part of it, but we did want to alert everybody to what we're seeing.
Rick Dierker: And then in terms of volume price in Q2, I would say, it's going to look a lot like the mix we saw in Q1, right? The midpoint of organic growth in Q2, I think, is going to be around 3.5%. I would say, volume is still going to be down around 5% because we saw some of that laundry, again concentration, bumpiness in early April because some retailers were not all the way full on shelf. And then from a price perspective that last 80% tranche of pricing is actually a full quarter effect. So it will be at or above Q1.
Peter Grom: Okay. Thank you, so much.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thank.
Operator: Our last question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Your line is open.
Wendy Nicholson: Hi. I appreciate I know the call has gone on a long time. I just had a small question really about the VMS business. I think you said earlier on that you were taking double-digit or mid-teens pricing on that business. And that surprised me, because I would have thought that's a higher gross margin business maybe the cost of ingredients wasn't as large. So number one was like why that the price increase is that high? And then secondarily, just -- and I know it's a small business, but still interested in it. Given that it's kind of more of a discretionary product, I don't need it may be as much as I don't need vitamins as much as I need laundry detergent. Do you expect to see more elasticity of demand in the VMS space? Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: VMS is actually holding up well. So demand is still high. As far as the price goes, the -- what I said, we've raised prices low-teens and that competitors are going up as well 6% to 10%. And historically, our -- have been the value gummy and still will be with these price increases. So we've had more room to move up. And yeah, ingredients and inputs and obviously transportation costs are all impacting the vitamin business. So it's no different than the other business as far as our logic for raising price. But the category is healthy. Demand is still strong. The gummy category was up, consumption was up 11% in Q1. And our household penetration is up appears to be sticking. And you always have the tailwinds of the wellness trend. Despite of this we also have a business for nasal hygiene and that was a pretty sleepy category once upon a time. It's much bigger outside the US, where we have a product like STERIMAR, but nasal hygiene category has been picking up. And I guess the other comment on the categories is private label share of gummies has declined. Last year first quarter it was 24%. And right now it's 22% so it's down 200 basis points. So yeah, I think the category is strong. Our issues are supply issues frankly right now.
Wendy Nicholson: Got it. That’s very helpful color. Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-28 10:00:00) =====
Matt Farrell: Thank you all for dialing in to join us today. I'm going to begin with the safe harbor statement. I recommend you read it at your leisure. We have our entire management team on the call today. We are all available for Q&A after the formal pitch. We have a lot of slides and several presenters. I’m going to give you the short story upfront. 2021 was the year of supply chain disruption, inflation and high consumer demand. We acted quickly in response, we raised price and we added a significant number of co-packers and suppliers to our network. Consumer demand drove significant sales growth, which enabled us to offset some of the inflation. Because of the demand, we are now planning to significantly expand our capacity for vitamins, litter and laundry in the next few years. During the past year, we kept our focus on being digitally savvy as our online sales grew to 15% of our global sales. We posted full year 2021 organic sales of 4%, which was broad-based across all our businesses, U.S., International and Specialty Products. Our full year 2021 EPS growth of 7% is down the mill of a 6% to 8% EPS outlook that we announced 12 months ago. We feel very good about hitting our EPS range given all that happened in 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect strong growth in both our U.S. and international businesses driven by consumer demand, which we expect to stay elevated for most of the year. Regarding inflation, we expect an incremental $155 million of cost inflation in 2022, some of which has already been priced. But we expect to take more pricing actions this year. As always, we have innovative new products to announce today. And I'm especially proud of some sustainability news that we will share in a few minutes. On the M&A front, we are quickly integrating our recent acquisition, TheraBreath, which is our 14th power brand and we are hunting for number 15. As you saw in the press release, we expect 3% to 6% organic sales growth and 4% to 8% EPS growth. The top-end of the sales and EPS ranges are dependent upon our ability to improve our fill rates. As supply improves, our shares are also expected to increase as well. Long-term, we believe our evergreen model is alive and well. Now let's jump into the formal part of the program. Let's start with our performance overtime. Just about any period you would pick, you would conclude Church & Dwight is a stellar performer within the CPG space and we are known for our consistency. 2021 was another year with 17.9% total shareholder return. We have an evergreen business model, which calls for 3% organic sales growth and 8% EPS growth. If you said how's that evergreen model working out for you? Well, let's take a look. We've averaged 4.3% organic sales growth for over 10 years. And if we take a look at EPS, we've averaged over 10% EPS growth over the same period. The sources of our 3% organic growth are 2% U.S., 6% International and 5% specialty products. We have 14 power brands and they drive more than 80% of our revenues and profits. We have a well-balanced portfolio with a pretty even split between household and personal care, Specialty Products rounds out the portfolio, representing 6% of sales. Our business has been known to perform well in virtually any economic environment, because we have a balance of 60% premium products and 40% value. We are well-positioned for good times and bad times. About three-quarters of our business is in the U.S., which means we have a lot of room to grow internationally. We believe one of our competitive advantages is we can move fast and adapt to a changing market. That quality was clearly demonstrated over the past 18 months given all the obstacles we have overcome. We have experienced significant headwinds in 2021, which will continue in 2022. You may have heard me say that it feels like we have been chasing a ball downhill. Well, that illustration you see was drawn by Scott Druker, the Head of our Animal Productivity Business. Obviously, we're very frugal here at Church & Dwight. Regarding the inflation headwinds, we will have raised price on 80% of our portfolio by February and we are not done. We are planning for more price increases in 2022. And later on in the presentation, Rick Spann, our Supply Chain Leader, will discuss our actions to address supply shortages. We have a long history of growth through acquisitions. Since 2004, we have completed an acquisition in almost every year as we have grown from a $1.5 billion company to over $5 billion today. Later on Barry Bruno, our Chief Marketing Officer, will take us through our most recent acquisition, TheraBreath. Back in the year 2000, we had only one power brand, and that was Arm & Hammer. Today, we have 14 Power brands that are leaders in each of their categories. We've become a digitally savvy company. Only 1% of our sales were online in 2015. Today, it's 15%. This is another example of our ability to adapt. We have a low exposure to private label. The weighted average private label share in our categories is 12%. Actually, only five of our 17 categories have meaningful private label exposure. In general, private label has not been a significant factor in our categories over the past year. Now I will turn the mic over to Barry Bruno, our Chief Marketing Officer.
Barry Bruno: Thanks, Matt, and hello, everyone. I'm Barry Bruno. And for the last several years, you've been hearing from me about our international business. But in October, I took over as our Chief Marketing Officer, so while I still love our international business and team, you're going to be hearing from me now about our U.S. domestic business. And that business, which as you heard earlier, represents over 75% of total Church & Dwight sales is in a great place and is well-positioned for future growth. And I can say that with confidence because first and foremost, we compete in healthy growing categories in which we often hold the number one or two market share position. Second, there are a number of macro trends, some of which are established and some of which are just emerging, which provide huge tailwinds to our brands going forward. And finally, our two most recent acquisitions have, for different reasons, which I'll get into shortly, huge room to run ahead of them. To my first point about healthy growing categories, here you can see the top 17 categories in which we compete, and whether they've grown in green or contracted in red in each calendar year. And what you'll see overwhelmingly is a lot more growth and contraction. And if you look more closely at 2021 performance, you'll see sequential aggregate weighted growth across all categories of plus 6.1% in 2021, which was on top of exceptional plus 12.5% growth in 2020. And if we drill one level deeper on 2021 performance, here you can see which categories drove that growth with gummy vitamins, dry shampoo, power water flossers and pregnancy test kits leading the way and more than offsetting softness in baking soda, electric grooming and cold shortening, which was driven down by an almost non-existent flu season in 2021. Despite excellent growth, our market share suffered in 2021, as persistent supply challenges and related in-stock levels left us with demand we just couldn't fulfill. This was especially impactful on our fabric care, VMS and cat litter businesses. As supply improves throughout 2022, we see a corresponding tailwind and expect market shares to improve accordingly. My second reason for confidence in the future, as that multiple trends, both established and emerging point to long-term future growth. The first trend centers around pricing, where you heard Matt confirm earlier that we've taken price on 80% of our portfolio. And we think pricing is a muscle, we're going to continue building as we expect a prolonged inflationary environment and see future price increases likely. The second trend is an elevated and we believe permanent consumer focus on maintaining a cleaner and healthier home. The third is a belief that from a health standpoint, both mental and physical prevention is the best medicine. The fourth is that self-care has gone beyond just an occasional splurge and has become an essential and permanent part of so many more consumers daily routines. And finally, that a gradual return to normalcy, despite what we've seen in the past few weeks is inevitable. And when consumers are ready to return to their pre-COVID social routines, we're ready for them. So let's dive deeper into each. On pricing, we took price on laundry and litter in mid-year 2021 and we're taking price and VMS and across multiple personal care categories right now. We'll have a full year benefit in 2022 on the majority of those increases, and the early read is that competition has followed or is following in all key categories. Prices are sticking and elasticities are better than our initial forecasts and should we move into a recessionary environment, our value brands, which make up 40% of our portfolio are well positioned for a consumer who's looking for deeper value. In terms of consumers, who are spending more time at home today and we think, we'll continue to spend increased time at home in the future and will therefore be even more focused on a clean and healthy home. We see great inroads with 3 million incremental households now using ARM & HAMMER and Oxiclean each versus pre-pandemic levels in 2019. We don't see this going backwards, and in fact, see household penetration continuing to build year-over-year. In the spirit of consumers looking to stay healthy, both mentally and physically, we see a continuing trend where consumers are looking to vitamins to help out and not just any vitamins but the gummy form in particular, which is where consumers are migrating to from pills and capsules is up 7 points since 2019. Equally important, is that we're well positioned in the category with offerings that match-up nicely to all of the consumer needs states that are growing, including sleep, stress, mood, among the others you can see here and all of that translates to an incremental 5.7 million households buying VITAFUSION in 2021 than we're buying in 2019. Likewise, brand awareness continues to grow and are aided brand awareness is an incredible 53 points since 2012. The fourth trend we see as not so much emerging but is already established is the belief that self-care is not just an occasional splurge, but it's an increasing part of daily routines. A few statistics that bear this out included 87% of consumers now claimed to actively practice self-care, while 70% have established specific self-care goals and 59 are practicing self-care more in 2021 than in 2020. A group of some of our most important brands, including WATERPIK, Spinbrush, VITAFUSION, Viviscal and TheraBreath are benefiting from this trend already and stand to benefit even more in the future. WATERPIK in particular has a lot of runway ahead since the household penetration for water flossers is 23% compared to power toothbrushes at approximately 40%. Finally, we're as eager as our consumers and each of you for a return to normal. And we're starting to see a reestablishment of social interaction which is driving categories like skin and nail care, dry shampoo, hair growth and depilatories to high single-digit or even double-digit growth. And we see that continuing. One interesting statistic to make this runway real is that BATISTE, which is one of our fastest growers in 2021 still has years of runway ahead as U.S. household penetration for dry shampoo is only 4.5% compared to the U.K., where the brand was born, where household penetration is 8%. Finally, one category that continues to lag is condoms, but we don't believe sex is over with just yet. So we're ready with America's number one condom brand when the category inevitably bounces back. And if that's not enough, we still have huge runway ahead on our two most recent acquisitions. With regard to ZICAM, we haven't had a normal cold and flu season since COVID struck. As we emerge from COVID and consumers are increasingly social, experts predict there's an inevitable return of the flu, and those peak seasons that we see in Q1 and Q4 will provide material growth that we haven't experienced since acquiring the brand. And now that we're launching ZICAM in a new gummy form, which I'll talk about more in a bit, there's even more reason to believe. Finally, THERABREATH was a great holiday present when the deal closed on December 24. And when we combine significant new distribution opportunities with our great WATERPIK dental hygienists detailing force, we see significant room for growth ahead. Speaking of THERABREATH, just about everyone suffers from morning breath and over 2.5 billion people worldwide are almost 30% of the world's population suffer from some sort of chronic bad breath. And that bad breath starts most of the time in the mouth, throat and tonsils driven by sulfur producing bacteria that lingers there. Dr. Katz, who we bought the brand from, realized this not only as a dentist himself, but as the father of a daughter who was struggling with chronic bad breath. So Dr. Katz invented this alcohol-free mouthwash designed to specifically target sulfur producing bacteria. It was a home run with his daughter, and you can see here that it's been a home run with consumers everywhere as it has been materially outpacing total mouthwash category growth and the alcohol-free category subset every year since launch. Better yet, there's still huge room to run ahead of us. This slide captures total retail points of distribution for our top competitors and for THERABREATH and what you'll quickly see is that even though THERABREATH is driving category growth as you saw in the last slide, we're way behind in total points of distribution with ample room to launch new variants, new sizes and expand into new channels ahead. So in summary, we participate in great healthy growing categories. Multiple key trends are our friend, and our most recent acquisitions have tremendous room to run. All of which give us confidence in our future. And we haven't even talked about new products yet. Okay. Now, let's move over to new products where we have a long history of launching new product innovation across our portfolio of power brands and 2022 will be no exception. So let's dive into a sampling of some of our 2022 new products. The new VMS consumer who entered during the pandemic is more likely to purchase gummies, seeks products with multiple benefits and as a more immune conscious consumer and as the category continues to shift to gummies, VITAFUSION set out to expand the relevance of gummies in order to continue to win it shelf. Introducing VITAFUSION BI-LAYER GUMMIES, these two-in-one gummies provide two benefits, two flavors and two colors to deliver multiple benefits in a fun and visually appealing way. This multi-plus platform clearly articulates product benefits to e-shop ability, and researchers told us that the platform is expected to grow the VMS retail market basket, as nearly 30% of respondents said they would take these in addition to their current multivitamin. The immune SKU is a multi-vitamin plus zinc and vitamin C. The beauty SKU is a multi-vitamin plus biotin and retinol and we're looking forward to both driving great continued growth. Now, moving over to our Specialty Haircare franchise, you heard me say earlier that over the past several years, there has been a shift in consumer priorities towards selfcare and during COVID, this trend has been magnified as consumers are spending much more time at home. One example of desired pampering treat oneself can be seen in 23% growth in hair treatments and within that segment 72% growth specifically in hair masks. Hair masks represent an opportunity to care for the health and condition of hair. However, they typically take around 10 minutes to work and need to be rinsed off in the shower. Introducing BATISTE Leave-in Hair Masks which deliver selfcare on her terms. These lightweight conditioning formulas are infused with plant-derived proteins and vitamin E and allow it to nourish hair and seal-in moisture between washes with no rinsing required. Now, over to health and well-being where two-thirds of consumers believe that products sold in the cough, cold, and flu aisle are more effective than those sold in the VMS aisle. And the ZICAM consumer is already buying over $40 worth of competitive immune products sold in the cough, cold, and flu aisle. So, we're losing out on potential sales by not having any immune products in that aisle. So, now I'm pleased to share that ZICAM is launching its immune supplement gummies the formula features ZICAM Zinc and also has 100% daily value of the top three immune ingredients. The line includes a regular formula and a night-time version with melatonin, as immune plus sleep is one of the fastest growing sub segments and VMS. Both products are also designed to provide a terrific value versus the competition. Now, over to fabric care, where the baby detergent segment is currently a $136 million category and is the second fastest growing segment and liquid laundry detergent. However, Arm & Hammer doesn't have a product here today to meet mom's needs, where we know she's looking for a hard working product at a reasonable price, so she doesn't have to compromise on what's best for her baby. Introducing our first Arm & Hammer baby launch detergent, which is designed to help families do what's best for their babies with zero compromises. Specially created with our Arm & Hammer babies in mind, it's gentle enough for baby skin, tested by pediatricians, and offers a hypoallergenic formula that has zero preservatives, no phosphates, and no dyes, and it's even EPA certified as a safer choice. We're very excited about this launch because a baby liquid laundry detergent also helps us downage the Arm & Hammer brand, increasing the lifetime value of each consumer. Let's take a look at some videos that bring this new offer from Arm & Hammer to life. [Video Presentation] So, in closing these are just a few highlights from another great year of innovation from Church & Dwight. Okay, now let's switch gears and move over to the steps we're taking on our path to a more sustainable future. Starting with the reality the climate is more relevant than ever, especially for our younger consumers. Gen Z in particular is two times more likely than Baby Boomers to say they've been personally affected by climate change. And the expectations for businesses and brands are very high. Consumers expect companies to take care of the planet and make progress on societal issues at the same time. As a company, our recent actions such as offsetting 100% of our global electricity demand by moving to green energy and in partnering with Arbor Day Foundation to plant millions of trees in the Mississippi River Valley, it helps set the stage for our next move, which is formalizing our climate strategy by submitting our application to the science-based targets initiative. We recognize the importance of taking a science-based approach to the environment and ensuring that the targets we set and corresponding actions we take are aligned to industry standards and best practices. Included in our application to SBTi is a commitment to slow the warming of the planet, increase the use of renewables and report on our progress through our annual sustainability report. So you can see that we're taking this problem seriously at a corporate level. But our consumers who have always been proud problem solvers want to get involved as well. And our goal is to engage them through the power of our most iconic brand, ARM & HAMMER, which is why today we're pleased to announce, we're kicking off a new campaign starting with ARM & HAMMER baking soda to show consumers we're taking responsibility for our impact on the environment, brand by brand. To get started, we measured our carbon footprint on baking soda and are working to reduce it to zero, initially through verified carbon offsets. Allow me to share a video with you that illustrates how we plan to bring this to life. [Video Presentation] Throughout this journey, our goals are to drive awareness, engage consumers and inspire action. We'll have more news to share in the space around how we can work in partnership with our consumers to multiply our efforts and invite you to follow our journey as we build new strengths here and do our part to protect the environment. Okay, now over to my friend Mike Read to talk about our growing international business.
Michael Read: Thanks, Barry and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I'd like to run you through the International consumer highlights, followed by our specialty product story. For the International division, our evergreen model target is 6% in organic sales growth. 2021, we posted organic growth and 5% slightly below our evergreen model of 6%, but lapping 8.6% growth in 2020 and while we're below our evergreen model target, 2021 is a strong delivery in the face of widespread global supply disruptions impacts from COVID-19 and weather-related events. Q4 finished at 4.7% growth combining our two International segments. First, our subsidiary markets which are fully staffed Church & Dwight teams Canada, Mexico, the U.K., France, Germany and Australia. And secondly, our Global Markets Group that covers more than 130 markets and represented by over 400 distributed partners around the globe. While their subsidiary and GMG segments posted positive growth in 2021 and continue to have strong consumer demand in improving market share positions in key categories. The result is we built an international consumer business that is now in excess of 900 million in sales and approaching scale in several markets.  Let's take a closer look. GMG now represents our largest segment at 35% of total international net sales has doubled in size over the past five years, followed by Canada at 28%, Europe at 22%, and Australia and Mexico at 8% and 7%. Across all our segments, we continue to gain distribution, introduce new brands and innovation, enter new channels and widen our geographic reach to drive growth. From a gross standpoint, our subsidiary markets grew 3% 2021 and GMG grew almost 11%. Important to note international mix is heavily weighted towards Personal Care and OTC categories versus household, many of which have faced category setbacks due to COVID-19. So what's driving our international growth, we have a portfolio of brands that consumers love and that's not limited to the U.S. market. And we are early days in many of the world's largest economies. We continue to expand our U.S. power brands into global power brands. Brands like ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean, and Trojan continue to gain momentum, all of which have long international runways in our global markets. This includes selectively leveraging innovation source out of our GMPI organization and launching locally relevant new products under our global brands. We continue to widen our Personal Care and OTC portfolio presence in emerging markets like China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, with particular focus on brands like BATISTE, ANUSOL, GRAVOL and STERIMAR. Our portfolio has proven over and over it can travel with success. We continue to drive household penetration of more recent acquisitions like Waterpik and Flawless. Acquisition has been a key growth driver for international and THERABREATH offers our latest installment. Let's turn now to some of the key investments and capabilities we're focused on. First, we continue to widen our support of a booming e-commerce business in China, with local resources and expertise to partner closely with our valued distributors. As one example in 2022, we're investing behind a direct sell model in China, which will enable us to sell new brands directly to consumers online via e-commerce portals. Second, we continue to evolve our manufacturing footprint strategy to help service the needs of a fast growing international business, particularly in Asia. This includes select local manufacturing and the use of co-packers or scale warrants and lower costs can be achieved. We’ve added people resources on the ground in our newest GMG office in Mumbai, India to support our local distributors and growth throughout the region. We continue to build e-commerce and digital marketing capability across the globe. To connect better with our consumers, and drive consumption in e-commerce platforms and we continue to approach pricing with discipline important in an inflationary environment. And we're adding dedicated resources in revenue growth management to support this capability moving forward. While this isn't an exhaustive list, it provides some examples of the investments we're making internationally to continue to drive profitable growth for years to come. As we continue to build scale, leverage pricing and improve brand mix towards Personal Care and OTC, we continue to deliver on our Evergreen target to expand operating margin in the international division by at least 50 basis points per year. We did better than expected in 2020 where we grew 120 basis points and 2021 is more of the same, bring operating margin another 120 basis points. In closing, on international, we've had a stellar track record of growth since 2014 and more than 900 million in net sales we are pacing ahead of the long term Evergreen model target by leveraging our portfolio brands that consumers love, including our newly acquired acquisitions and innovation, continuing to expand our global market footprint and by investing in key capabilities, international remains committed to delivering our Evergreen target of 6% organic sales growth and expanding operating margin by 50 basis points. Okay, let's switch gears to our animal productivity story. Specialty Products Division from an Evergreen model perspective aims to deliver 5% organic sales growth Specialty Products Division is now more than 330 million in sales and post its strong growth above plan in 2021 at 12%. 70% of the business is animal productivity, while the remaining 30% is supported by specialty chemical sales. As you can see, animal productivity is split into two main segments dairy and non-dairy. We produce three types of products; prebiotics, probiotics and nutritional supplements. This is important as today's consumer continues to move away from foods produced with antibiotics. And our portfolio is geared directly to support this growing trend. The dairy business is a cyclical market and represents the biggest part of the animal productivity business. Typically, every few years we see an up year as evidenced by 2011, 2014 then again in 2017. Due to COVID-19 we did experience a delay in the upcycle in 2020 and we did anticipate a strong recovery in 2021. But with healthy milk prices forecasted and strong demand for dairy products we do you expect back to back years of organic growth in 2022, breaking the animal productivity cycle. Back in 2015 non-dairy sales were largely non existing. Today non-dairy sales represent approximately 26% and as balanced out in our portfolio. We expect our non-dairy sales to grow double digit in 2022. Similarly, we're adding resources and growing our animal nutrition business globally. In 2021, our international business has grown to represent 16% of total sales. Again, offering further balance and revenue growth streams in our portfolio. In summary, specialty products has delivered an impressive 12% growth in 2021. We’re backed by a trusted brand ARM & HAMMER, we’re aligned to grow consumer trends towards prebiotics and probiotics. We continue to widen our species footprint to include cattle, swine, and poultry. And we're adding resources to grow our international business. Thanks for listening now over to Rick Spann to talk about supply chain.
Rick Spann: I'm going to take a few moments to talk about our efforts to secure the performance of our supply chain. Like many manufacturers, we have stepped up our focus on resiliency over the last two years. Here's how we articulate our strategy. Church & Dwight has a short, resilient and tariff proof supply chain serving Western and APAC market with local manufacturing. We have implemented several initiatives to reduce the length of our supply chain over the last few years. One example is how we are supplying our growing business in the APAC region. In 2020, 0% of our business sold in APAC was manufactured there. By the end of next year, 40% will be sourced from within the region. Closer to home, we have added 3PLs to our distribution network, which has enabled us to position buffer inventory closer to our customers DCs in the southeast and south-central regions. In order to reduce tariffs and our overall dependency on China, we have started to move WATERPIK manufacturing to other Southeast Asia locations. By the end of 2023, 50%. of our volume will be produced ex-China. We do a good job of managing a complex base of suppliers and co-packers. In order to add additional sourcing options, we have increased our co-manufacturing base by 19% since the start of the pandemic and our supplier base by 22%. We now have many more options when we face upstream disruptions. Of course, in addition to a large base of contract manufacturers, we have impressive in-house manufacturing capabilities, with an ability to produce a wide array of products in multiple format across our 15 plants. We’ve have done a lot of work over the last two years to increase throughput out of our plants and to be the best employer in areas where we operate, so that we can retain and attract talented employees and we are making significant capacity investment in-house in order to stay ahead of our growing categories. We have either completed or have active capacity projects underway for scent boosters, liquid laundry, unit dose laundry, trigger products, VMS and cat litter. We have a dedicated and talented supply chain team. The vision that they march to is to maintain operational excellence while creating the supply chain in the future. Our talented team has done a great job of dealing with the many urgent issues that the pandemic has put in front of them, while building more resiliency for the future.  And now back to Matt.
Matt Farrell: Thanks, Rick. Let's spend a few minutes on how we run the company. We have five operating principles. Number one, we leverage our brands, number two, we are a friend of the environment. Number three, we have highly productive people. Number four, we strive to be asset light. And finally, number five, we leverage acquisitions. If you do the first four well, you will have good shareholder returns. If you can add solid acquisitions, you can generate great returns. Number one, we are fortunate to have brands that consumers love and we have dozens of brands around the world. Number two, we have a long history of being a friend of the environment. You can see some of the milestones on this slide. We are very proud of our heritage. And you heard Barry take us through our most recent commitment to science-based targets. In addition to our goal of being carbon neutral by 2025 through science-based targets, we have a goal of reducing our water usage by 10% annually and maintaining a solid waste recycling rate of 75%. And we have received plenty of recognition for our ESG efforts. A few of them are displayed here. Number three, we have the most productive people in the CPG space. We have approximately 5,000 employees with 1 million in sales per employee. We believe this is an underappreciated performance measure. Our people are motivated by a simple compensation structure with four metrics, sales, gross margin, EPS and cash from operations. Our long-term incentives are stock options, so we are aligned with shareholders to drive our valuation. We have a focus on gross margin. This is an uncommon incentive compensation metric. While we missed our gross margin target in 2021, that hasn't shaken our confidence. We are still focused on the four drivers of gross margin expansion. Good to Great, which is our continuous improvement program, supply chain optimization, new products and acquisition synergies. Number four is, leverage assets. We are an asset light company. Historically, CapEx average is about 2% of sales. That will be higher in 2022 and 2023, as we expand our capacity in our growing businesses, namely vitamins, laundry, and litter. Number five is, leverage acquisitions. As I said earlier, we have a long history of growth through acquisitions. We have clear acquisition criteria and the discipline to apply that criteria, which is to buy number one or number two brands. They need to grow at or above our Evergreen model and have gross margins in excess of corporate gross margins. We are attracted to businesses that are asset light. Oftentimes, we can leverage our scale to generate synergies and finally they need to have a sustainable competitive advantage.  Our long term view is this. We have 14 power brands today, 20 tomorrow. Next up is Rick to take us through the financials.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We have some great results to share. Across the board, we finished 2021 better than expected, led by strong consumer demand for our products and we're entering 2022 with momentum. Today we'll walk through four areas. First, the Evergreen model; second, on 2021 results; third, our 2022 outlook; and then finally, I'll wrap up with capital allocation. Here's our Evergreen business model. We've had this for a very long time and our long term investors know this: 3% organic sales growth, 8% EPS growth and the details would be plus 3% organic sales growth, 25 basis points of gross margin expansion, marketing's typically flat, SG&A is leveraged, and we get 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, which leads to 8% EPS growth. We have a lot of different levers to pull in order to get 3% and 8%. So for 2021, we ended the year in the quarter with 4.3% organic sales growth. Domestic was 3.5%, International was a little bit better than 4.5% and SPD was 12%. Gross margin declined by 50 basis points, but this was better than we expected. Marketing change was down 90 basis points, at 14.7%, a lot higher than 13% our outlook had. This is really because we had a great tax benefit that we will spend back in marketing. SG&A was plus 50 basis points and EPS was $0.64 or $0.06 better than our $0.58 outlook. Our full year 2021, we ended the year with 4.3% or getting sales growth, 3.5% for Domestic, 5% for international and 12% for SPD. Gross margin was down 160 basis points, as we faced 9% of COGS inflation year-over-year or $250 million. Marketing was down 100 basis points to 11.1% and adjusted SG&A was down 50 basis points, all to get adjusted EPS at 7% or $3.02 per share. Cash from operations was $994 million and free cash flow conversion was 116%. That's free cash flow divided by net income. How much net income have we turned into cash flow? Gross margin contracted in 2021 and in Q4, we were down 50 basis points. But price volume mix was plus 290, which was partially offsetting the inflation, the massive headwind of inflation, commodities, distribution, labor. Productivity programs added 110 basis points and then the acquisition was plus 30 basis points. So that's how we get to minus 50. As you can see, when you compare Q4 2021 full year, you can see the gap between price volume mix and inflation narrowing and we expect that to continue in 2022. Now turning to the outlook. 5% to 8% reported sales growth, 3% to 6% organic sales growth, operating profit margin of plus-60 to plus-70 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 4% to 8%. And here's the detail. The 3.6% organic sales growth is made up of domestic at 3% to 6%, International, at 5% to 7%, and SPD at 5%. All these divisions are at or above their Evergreen model for organic sales growth. Gross margins contracts, marketing the dollars are higher. We leverage us SG&A. And that's how we get to 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion. The effective tax rates higher year-over-year by 320 basis points or 23%. This is a huge headwind to face, but our profit is actually going to be up 10% plus as a result just showing and demonstrating the strength of our business. Adjusted EPS growth is 48% and cash from operations is about $920 million, as we build back safety stocks on inventory. Here's organic sales over the, 10 year horizon. Our Evergreen model is 3%. Our 10 year average is closer to 4.1%. And our 2022 outlook is 3% to 6%. And we're focused on gross margin. And we have been for a long time. Very few companies have it in their incentive targets. We believe it drives not only cash earnings, but cash flows well. In 2021, way to step down, partly due to inflation with a 9% increase in COGS. In 2022, we expect a 5% to 6% increase in COGS. All the pricing work that we're doing is offsetting that, but we're going to be continued to chase that ball downhill. So we're committed to offset dollar-for-dollar, but margin will be down in 2022. There is a cadence the margin. In the first half we expect to be down. In the second half we expect it to be up, largely because of the timing of inflation in 2021. Specifically, in Q1 we expect margin to decline by 250 basis points. On marketing spend we have a long track record of spending behind our brands. In 2021, we hit 11.1%. In 2022, we're going to have higher dollars in 2021. The percent will be lower, as it's impacted by the top line price and actions that we've taken. SG&A leverage is a hallmark of Church & Dwight. We have the highest revenue per employee in the industry. We expect in 2022 to again leverage SG&A. And we have a long track record of great EPS growth, ups high single-digit, low double-digit EPS growth for a long, long time. In 2022, we expect 4% to 8% EPS growth, $3.14 to $3.26. The cadence for EPS growth is similar to gross margin, down in the first half, but up in the second half. We expect stronger volumes in the back half as our supply chain improves. And we have normalized promotional levels. Turning to cash flow, this is probably my favorite slide. 10 years of history here. A 122% average free cash flow conversion, in 2021, 116%. And how do we do that? We do it through tight control working capital. We've moved our cash conversion cycle from 52 days down to the 30s in the 20s and now 15 days in 2021. In 2022, we expect that to go up a little bit as we build back inventory and safety stock. We have a strong balance sheet. We ended 2021 with 1.9 times debt to EBITDA. We expect to end 2022 with 1.6 times debt to EBITDA. That's despite doing our fourth largest acquisition recently THERABREATH. This has been our business model for a long period of time. We buy business. We lever up. And we paid down. And we have significant financial capacity. We could do a $3.8 billion deal and maintain our credit rating. And moving to capital allocation, here are the prioritized uses of cash flow. First ROI, TSR-Accretive M&A development, number two Capex For Organic Growth & G2G, number three, new product development, number four debt reduction and number five return cash to shareholders through dividends or buyback. We're not a capital intensive company. Our Evergreen models around 2% of sales for CapEx and for many years we've run below that. But you can see back in 2009, we have to add capacity we do, and it will spike and in 2022 and 2023, it's no different. We're going to bump up as we add capacity for laundry, litter, vitamins. And then finally we have a 4% dividend increase in 2022. This is 121 consecutive years of dividends. And then in Q3 and Q4, we also spent $500 million on share buybacks. So we always like to return cash to shareholders. This is the formal presentation. And now we'll turn it over to Matt and myself and the rest of the leadership team for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Chris Carey: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Matt Farrell: Good morning.
Chris Carey: Just a question on pricing relative to volumes kind of a wide range on organic sales. As you get through the year, are you embedding the potential that elasticity is starting to become a bigger factor as you get through the year perhaps the consumer is less able to handle the additional pricing? And then in the near-term just on Q1, clearly, the organic sales outlook with the pricing and consciousness some is coming later in the quarter still seem relatively low to the momentum that you've been seeing cognizant of some of the supply chain headwinds in otherwise, can you just frame the potential flex in that Q1 top line outlook as well? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes, sure. I'll take the quarter and some of those answers are going to be explained and we’re talking about the full year as well. So on Q1, our outlook is 1% to 2%, Chris. And it's largely two reasons, but let me talk about price/volume mix first for the year. So if you take our – the midpoint of our outlook for organic growth, it's about 4.5%, right, 3% to 6%, midpoint is 4.5%. We would say that price mix is about 5.5% and then –we have a drag of volume of about 1%. All that 1% in Q4 and Q1, though, so that's 4%. And the rationale is three things. One is volume elasticities, right, all the price increases that we're effective in 2021, we're really in the second half of the year. Number two, we discontinued some club programs for WATERPIK. And then as we always do, we rationalize low margin volume for laundry. So those are three reasons why we're 1% to 2% in the quarter. And that's also why price/volume mix actually improves throughout the year. Organic improves throughout the year and gross margin also improved throughout the year.
Rick Dierker: Chris, does that answer your question?
Chris Carey: Oh, yes, yes. Thanks so much. And then just following up on your spending levels for this year, marketing back to the lower end of the historical range. Can you just talk about how you view that as a flex item in the outlook through the year we stay committed to that level of spending, should volume elasticity become more of a dynamic? Would you look to spend more behind, say, bringing back promotional levels, just the sorts of actions that you'd look to should elasticity become more of a factor as we get through the year? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, that's exactly what we would do, Chris, and obviously we have a wide range for both reported and for organic. So I saw our supply chain issues abate and we're getting more shipments outdoor, got opportunity to spend more on marketing. And the expectation is anyway for '22 versus '21, that our marketing dollars are going to be up year-over-year. Just said, if you look at the percentage may not be lower than '21, but you got to keep in mind, you get big price increases that are driving the top line. So, the relationship is a little bit different percentage of sales, but our dollar spent is up in '22 versus '21.
Chris Carey: Okay. Thanks so much
Matt Farrell: All right. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the organic sales outlook because perhaps for the full year, the widest range we've seen in a while, obviously, starting at a relatively low point in Q1, but I mean, your comps are only about 120 basis points of a range from low to high end. So that's a really substantial step up as the year progresses. And you just noted that every year you rationalize similar margin sales. So that should be in the comp presumably, as well. So just, a little bit more granularity with respect to your views as you implement the price increases. And what seems like a fairly favorable view on the volume elasticity as the year progresses? Thank. 
Matt Farrell: Yes. You are right about our elasticities. Our elasticities are actually much better than we had expected. So if you took a liquid laundry, for example, it's in a 20 to 30 range, and we expected it to be worth actually, and that'll actually probably improve going forward simply because we know that both Proctor and Nickel are now raising prices. Or as the range grows, it’s kind of a wide range, we haven't had a range like that in the past, but it's with good reason. Our fill levels have been low for not just the past 12 months, but it's almost the past 18 months, and we've had difficulty raising them. So to the extent that our labor issues are big and not only in-house, but also out-house. Suppliers and co-packers are also struggling with labor. That's we get more and more product to ship. We're going to have much higher top line. Now look, we also know we have a high single-digit price increase. So you think well, if you get a high single-digit price increase, you would think that you're going to have a pretty robust reported top line and an organic top line, which we will, if we can can ship the product. But that's - we had to leave ourselves some room because we're anticipating things getting better, but hasn't happened yet.
Rick Dierker: Yes, the only thing I would add to that, Olivia, it's Rick, is 2021 was the most volatile year in many, many years. And so we're used to give in tight ranges, but 2022 we expect to be very volatile as well. And so, like a lot of companies, we just ensure we have a range of possibilities for the revenue line and the earnings line.
Olivia Tong: Got it. Thanks. And on the margin guide looking for 60, 70 basis points in operating margin, despite gross margin declined on marketing increasing perhaps looks like as the - in dollar terms, but maybe not in terms of margin on a year-over-year basis. So that would imply some pretty nice improvement on G&A. So can you talk about some of the key levers there to improve G&A? And then just one last question on vitamins, if you could just talk about the competitive dynamics given you've, obviously, continued to add innovative new products. You've got solid demand for the category, but just wondering if you could touch on competition? Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Okay. Let's talk about vitamins first. So demand is really high for vitamins, right now. And the category was up 8% for the full year and our share position is very strong. You heard from Barry earlier a household penetration is up and is sticking and we have tailwinds, of course, two of them, one is the wellness trend and the other one is to transition from pills and capsules to gummies. And part of our success in the last few years and we think continuing into the future is going to be our new product launches. They've done really well this past year. As far as private label let those come up from time-to-time. Private label share gummies has declined in four consecutive quarters. It went from 25% four quarters ago, now 21%, the most recent quarter. And looking ahead to 2022, we have a nice line up for new products. We can sell everything we make and we have a couple of co-packers that are going to be coming online mid-year, so that should give us some relief.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And then as - in terms of the operating expansion where that's coming from? You're right Olivia, we've said that gross margin is going to be down, marketing as a percent of sales will be down, dollars will be up and that means we're going to also leverage SG&A. We've said for many years when you look at our Evergreen model for SG&A, we're trying to get 25 basis points from that. And we've done the math and we've said, hey, if we can grow our SG&A dollars at half the rate of sales in the Evergreen model, right, 3% of sales then it starts 15 basis points. And so our revenue is growing anywhere between 5% and 8% next year, so we're going to be able to leverage that because we're still having the same type of dollar increase on SG&A. So we expect that to stop. I'm not going to point to any specific details, but we’ll have more leverage than normal because our top lines growing faster.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Powers: Can you elaborate on the improvement in the North American supply and so rates that you're anticipating just in terms of your latest best case timing, and just do we improve all the way back to normal by the end of the year or second half, or is it - are you still expecting tightness throughout 2022?
Matt Farrell: Yes, okay. Thanks, Steve. We think it's going to be sequential improvement throughout the year. We normally have fill rates around 98%, 99%, we're low 80s right now. So what we - we hope to be exiting the year in the mid-90s, but we have Rick Spann on the phone, who's our Head of Supply Chain, so he's a guy who’s going to make it happen. Anything to add, Rick?
Rick Spann: Yes. Thanks, Matt. So we're doing a lot, as you saw from the presentation, we're investing in incremental capacity. Those projects take time, of course. So where - we need to, where we're increasing our third-party manufacturing, to supplement supply to hold us over until the capacity projects come on stream. But as Matt said, we will progress up through the mid-90s by the end of the year. Omicron gave us a step back with high absenteeism, but we're already starting to see absenteeism and improving our plants and now we're focusing on upstream supply of materials. 
Steve Powers: Okay. Great. Two quick questions. The follow-up on pricing if I could. Just first one is for the pricing, I guess to what degree is the pricing you've announced that hasn't yet hit the market and what's the cadence of that incremental pricing flowing through number one? And then just on some of the new products, specifically the ZICAM VMS products and baby ARM & HAMMER detergent, how are those going to be priced relative to the rest of your VMS and laundry portfolios, respectively? Thank you. 
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll take the incremental pricing. So we did announce, you know, a few months ago that we were going have a commodity price hit that extra 30% its - now we're 80% plus and that’s going hit in late February. We haven't - and we wouldn't front run any other conversations on pricing on this call. But we will report back and let you know when there is incremental pricing above that 80%.
Matt Farrell: Another question was pricing for the baby product.
Steve Powers: Yes, the ZICAM VMS and baby just relative to you know, the rest of those portfolios.
Matt Farrell: Yes, okay. Well, maybe Paul or Barry like to comment. 
Paul Wood: Yes.
Matt Farrell: They might be sipping coffee. 
Paul Wood: This is Paul. I think the probably the easiest way to answer all three on one is there is going to be lying price within the set right. The part of these launches is we want to be complimentary to the set or incremental purchases the part of the family brands have particularly you can imagine on ZICAM and VMS and others. Baby obviously is a different proposition, but still an increment purchase and that a mom is looking for a separate product, you know, for the baby loads. But I would say on that one, I don't want to be too perspective detailed on this call, but I would say we're well-priced competitively in the category would be how I'd answer that one in particular. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Kevin Grundy: Good morning, everyone. Question for Matt and Rick on the guidance, and then an unrelated question for Barry, if I could squeeze in a second one. The first one the long-term guidance of 3%, sort of, in the spirit of the Analyst Day and sort of more longer term oriented. The company's exceeded it naturally for a number of years, you're guiding above that for this upcoming year at about 4.5%. You have a slide up which rightly points out the higher category growth alone sort of setting aside which you hope to do from a market share perspective. You talk a lot about some of the stickiness and consumer behavior around health and wellness where I think most people on this call would agree. And then I suspect for your own internal planning around capacity and around you your cost structure, I suspect that's predicated on the growth rate over the next three years to five years ahead of that 3%. So that's all a big sort of wind up here, you considered revisiting that that guidance for investors.
Matt Farrell: Kevin, I could have predicted this question was common. I think you are consistent. I think you asked that question annually.
Kevin Grundy: You got be disappoint in that..
Matt Farrell: Well, I thought maybe we duck it this year because we have this range of three to six, and four and a half's in the middle. I think Kevin's going to be happy with that. What you're asking about is should we change our evergreen model?
Barry Bruno: Correct. Correct. And even better if I could that because you even consider changing where it's, you know, less emphasis on the 50 basis points of margin improvement which is tough to do year-in year-out in the absence of favorable mix from doing deals. So heavier on the top line and even something 25 to 50 on operating margin. So sorry for cutting you off, but go ahead.
Matt Farrell: No, no, no, I'm - I understand the math. But the way - the way we've used the Evergreen model is we do it for our long range planning. And yes, we don't everyone leave us so short from a capacity standpoint. So just because we have a 3% Evergreen model, doesn’t mean that we would put any governor's or caps on our - on capacity expansion because it's the last thing you want to do is to be completely sold out. So I would remind you as well that the Evergreen model is - is also something that is very important to financial literacy within the company because it's something we talk about all the time. It's familiar to all of our employees. So yes, there is some merit to your argument, where we to say, we're going to grow at a 4% organic level takes some of the air out of the balloon when it comes to gross margin, but does still - we will still arrive at the 8% EPS number on the bottom, so yes It's not something we don't think about Kevin. Don't think once a year when you asked this question, give it some thought. But yes, stay tuned. It's something we've been looking at.
Kevin Grundy: Understood, fair enough. And then if I could just squeeze in one more. Just for Barry, early observations, since moving into the CMO role, biggest areas of opportunity that you see sort of fresh advice, fresh perspective of the portfolio, and then maybe areas that perhaps need a little bit more of your attention over the next 12 months.
Barry Bruno: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. I think 90 days in or so, I think - you know, I've been telling the international story for so long before about how much is there. I think I see ample opportunity here in the U.S., as well, right. There are so many of those trends that I took you through earlier in the presentation that are so well suited to our brands and the categories that we're in. So, you know, I've been beating up on the U.S. guys, when I was in international for a while. But I'd say equally excited here and whether it's around vitamins or whether it's around laundry our supply comes back, ample opportunity everywhere. And then in terms of challenges or things, I'm looking at, as we spend more in media, where Trick and Matt, mentioned up in absolute dollars next year. What's the best spend of that digital gets really, really attractive because of its perceived perfect measurability. But I think Linear still has a role, Linear TV still has a role for its broad reach. So really working on that right mix of Linear versus digital and kind of upper funnel brand building versus lower funnel by now by here kind of stuff. So those are early thoughts. Great opportunity. Want to get the marketing mix right as it's a large line item in our P&L
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Thanks for taking my question. So the first area I want to touch on is just International. I was curious what you guys are seeing lately in the International price, whether you're seeing any impact on lockdowns or restrictions?
Matt Farrell: Yes, no, we have - I'm going dish this to Mike Read in a second but you're absolutely right that we've had intermittent lockdowns in a lot of markets. Internationals also hampered by transportation issues and containers and getting product. And if you look at our guide for next year, we said 5% to 7% and, our Evergreen number is 6%, so we are expected to be in the sweet spot but maybe Mike you could give a little bit of color on what we've been experiencing in International markets.
Michael Read: Yes. Thanks Matt, and thanks Rupesh for the question for the question. Yes, look, we're having similar challenges, as Matt said from a supply chain perspective, but what I'd point to is we have really healthy consumer demand for a portfolio across the board. We are seeing really strong growth across all the subsidiary divisions, but also within kind of how we break out our global markets grouped into kind of five regions. So we are seeing really positive growth in demand. It's really just about fulfilling it. So, I'd point to our ability to kind of access our portfolio. Multiple markets, is still really strong. It's just a matter of kind of keeping up with demand, but the orders are definitely there.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then…
Rick Dierker: Yes. And Rupesh, this is Rick. I just want to add one line to that. We had 4.7% organic growth in Q4 for international, so somebody might say, oh, well, that's a little below your Evergreen model for international. But I would tell you, if you look back in Q4 2020 we grew 14.9%. So on the two year stack, the 19.5% growth rate is the strongest quarter actually in the whole year.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And maybe just two quick financial questions. So first, on the CapEx side, any specific guidance you may give on CapEx. I think last time you guys said expect to exceed $200 million in gross margins. Is there any additional color you can provide just in terms of drivers for the year?
Rick Dierker: Yes. On the CapEx side, we have a slide in the analyst deck and we actually put out a number. I think it was $212 million off top of my head, but it was $200 million-plus for 2022, and it was $300 million - it was $216 million in 2022 and it's plus $300 million in 2023 is what we're putting out there right now just for those capacity projects like laundry, litter and vitamins. In terms of gross margin, I think the biggest thing on gross margin and we've talked about how it's going to improve throughout the year, is really just the - when you take price, - oh let's talk about inflation. We have $150 million of inflation, right? So the simple math is when you do that, you're down like 300 basis points on margin. But when you take price, even if you take price about 150 million to offset it, you only get a margin benefit of about 160 or 170 basis points, because it impacts the top line and impacts COGS. So, I think as I said before, gross margin improves throughout the quarter and we'll exit the year with positive gross margin in Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to find out like obviously the M&A priority in your cash allocation. What are the areas that you're thinking there's to white spaces for you to go inorganically? And then on the fine print on this, appreciate Rick you’re giving the margin bridge, but I believe you still have the benefits. In the fourth quarter you have, I believe, 30 basis points and for the full year 20 basis points benefit from acquisition like that is an additional, call it, 20 bps for the year in terms of acquisition. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Thanks, Andrea. I'll do some of the margin discussion and Matt will do the M&A question. I wasn't really given a margin bridge. I was just given an example on how price doesn't have the same margin impact as inflation would. I wasn't really got into specific numbers there, but we're not going to get into the margin details piece. It’s just more volatile than normal. And so the guidance is that we're going to decline on gross margin for 2022.
Matt Farrell: Yes, and as far as acquisitions go, we've had this question from time-to-time, what categories are we interested in? And if you asked us that two years ago, I think we probably would not have come up with - going into call it shortening or going into mouthwash. But - so what we do because we have a competency in making so many different types of products in our manufacturing facility, so we can put liquid in a bottle, we can make aerosols, we can put the powder in a box, gels, et cetera. There's a lot of things that we know how to make and can manage. So, consequently, we throw a very wide net when we're looking at potential acquisitions. And we have a well-worn list of acquisitions that we went through in our pitch this morning and the five criteria which that does weed out a lot of categories, but we wouldn't be able to call out hey, here's a couple of categories we're looking for acquisitions, Andrea, just our process doesn't work that way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.
Peter Grom: Thanks and good morning everyone. So, I was kind of hoping to drill down or get back to that slide that showed category growth that Kevin alluded to in his question earlier. I think you look back to 2017, 2019, it was kind of hovering around that 4% range, obviously accelerated a lot in 2022 and I think it showed like up 6% in 2021. So, I'm just curious how do you see category growth unfolding as you move ahead and then there's a lot of puts and takes, some categories are going to be getting better, some probably getting worse, but like what is the right category growth rate longer term as we move further away from this like COVID environment?
Rick Dierker: Yes, well, Barry can take a swing at that, but I'll just say historically, if you're referring to that particular slide, generally are the categories that we're in. and remember every company is different. So, the organic growth rates are a function of what categories you're in. So, we're different than lots of other companies, I'm sure that you follow, but historically, our average if you took 2017, 2018, 2019, its around 4%. 2020 was gigantic, 12.5%, 6.5% in 2021. So, it's going to float down over time. We expect to go back to around 4%, 4.5%, but I think the expectation for 2022 would be higher than that. Barry, anything you want to add to that?
Barry Bruno: Yes, you got it right. Again, historically, Peter 3%, 4% has been kind of the weighted average growth of the categories that we're in, obviously, elevated in 2020, still high in 2021. There are a number of them that are going to benefit from some of the trends that I touched on when I look at vitamins as a new behavior that's more permanent and we're in more and more households and vitamins are overall, of course. So, there's a few that'll continue to benefit, but I think there's a reversion to more normal levels as things return back to normal. So, is that in the 4% range versus 6%? I think that's a safe assumption.
Peter Grom: That's super helpful. And then I guess, maybe like a follow-up on ZICAM and kind of the underlying assumption around like a normal and cold flu season ahead, is there a way to quantify how much of a benefit just a normal season would be in terms of your total company organic revenue growth? And like is that included in your guidance already for 2022 or would that be like a source of upside? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll give you a little bit of context on ZICAM. Number one cold shortening, it's got a 76% share. The recent trends are certainly encouraging. So, if you looked at consumption in Q4 2021 versus 2020, it was up 21%. So, it's the brand we brought - we bought for the long-term and expect it to - we do expect it to be a contributor to sales and profits in 2022, but wouldn't necessarily call out what the net sales number is for a particular brand.
Barry Bruno: Yes, I mean, we think it's an - get to be more like a normal cold and flu season, but probably not all the way too bright. Yes, we're not going to get all the way back yet. I think that'll happen in 2023.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with Truist. Your line is open.
Bill Chappell: Hi, there’s a few kind of quick ones, one on pricing, the 80% level, why isn't that a 100% now just because it seems like everybody's pricing everything. And as we look forward over the next few months, will that number go to a 100% or is the next vendor pricing more incremental pricing on the first 80%?
Matt Farrell: Hey, Bill, that's very critical to…
Bill Chappell: Inquisitive…
Matt Farrell: Yes, yes. Well, look, there's some things that we didn't raise price on in 2021 that we're looking ahead to pricing in 2022. We're not going to get all the way to 100% but we expect to get above 80%. You know, some categories that we haven't priced on we just bought into the mouthwash category, right, that'd be one. So ZICAM is another one that we found that for a year, so we haven't taken price on that. But anything that we intend to take pricing we've already baked done. So it's not - you shouldn’t be thinking that that's going to be all upside.
Rick Dierker: Right. And there are some areas where there hasn't been cost inflation like they’re small but there are some areas where that hasn't happened and you don't have the cost or to go back to retailers on a few brands.
Matt Farrell: Yes, like condoms for example, Latex isn't rocketing.
Rick Dierker: Right, but I would say overall, we expect the 80% to go a little bit higher and we also expect to revisit price increases we've made.
Bill Chappell: Yes, got it. Well, on the line of inquisitive, not critical, you know I get the - this is a normal practice every year of you have tax benefits or other benefits and you plowed back into marketing and kind of third and fourth quarter. But why does that make sense in this year's fourth quarter when you're having low fill rates to put more into marketing, which would seem to exacerbate the issue? 
Matt Farrell: Yes, well, there were certain brands particularly, personal care that we decided to put more money behind where our fill rates weren't as bad, that might have been neglected earlier in the year, so BATISTE, would be - would be one of those WATERPIK would be another and even THERABREATH, even though we own just for a week or so. We spend money behind that because we want to get that off to a good start. So we put some money behind that late - late December.
Bill Chappell: Got it. So it's more selective and kind of how you reinvest that money.
Matt Farrell: Yes, right. It wasn't peanut butter. It was very targeted.
Bill Chappell: And last just on the capacity expansions you've talked about, I mean, I understand especially on vitamins that takes longer but it would seem that especially for something like cat litter and maybe for detergent, that your facility can be expanded fairly quickly. You know, and that you could have those expect the capacity by mid-year or sometime this year, is that not the right way is does it take that much longer? 
Rick Spann: Yes, I would say in general Bill, it takes about 18 months for a capacity project. And you're right, we have available space in the network, not necessarily just work but in the network. But those capital projects run into the same things that are happening all over the globe and macro economy in terms of labor availability and timing of machinery and stuff like that. Rick, respond anything you have to add on that one.
Matt Farrell: Yes. The only thing I would add - thanks, Rick - is that you know, in some cases, we're doing capacity increases on top of capacity increases. I mean, our litter volume, volume growth has been explosive and so we're - we're pouring more money into capacity increases there. So that's - that that's part of the dynamic, and then the other piece of it is just what Rick said, our lead times on equipment that we're purchasing for these capacity increases has increased pretty dramatically versus what they were pre-COVID because - because of those supply chains are also impacted.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: A little bit more maybe on the impact of supply constraints. Looks like your fill rates were still quite reasonable and maybe just inventories are low. But was there any impact on your top line from lack of supply anywhere?
Matt Farrell: Yes, certainly. I think we've been pretty clear these last few quarters that when you look at ship into consumption, right? Our consumption in Q4 was anywhere between 6% and 7%. And our domestic organic rate was 3.5%. And so that's been pretty, pretty consistent GAAP these last few quarters. That's also why we think we're going to have a high - high range in 2022. Like as supply chain improves and Matt respond both commented on how that's going to sequentially improve to the year that's also going to be a tailwind next year.
Rick Spann: Yes. So it's a - in short story is that we did leave money on the table because of difficulties with getting supply.
Kaumil Gajrawala: And capacity are there - I guess, particularly for vitamins is - these are your own facilities now or is it CapEx going into something you might need to contribute to a co-packer or something? And then if you're willing to kind of share, what some sort of - what sort of underlying growth that you're expecting for that category within the context of the decision to spend more to increase capacity?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So the capital that we're contributing is actually internal capacity for gummy manufacturing. We're also working with third-party manufacturers to increase our capacity but no, no capital contributions there. The growth rate you know if you look back, right, when we bought this business, the percent of gummies for heart pills in the total vitamin category was 3%. Now we're in the 20%s. And we have long term visions of that's going to continue to go to the 30%s and 40%s over time. So we think that growth rate is high is what I would tell you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Lieberman: Good morning. I just had two questions. One was just in terms of retailer reaction to sell some of these supply chain challenges that you've been having. And I think during 3Q you talked about kind of pulling - very rationally pulling some of the promotional support, because of those lower not wanting to exacerbate the supply demand issues. So just curious about kind of retailer reaction, because it seems like some of your supply issues maybe at this point are a bit worse than what you're seeing from some - some competitors in your category? So I was curious about that was one. And then the second thing was and I apologize that I missed this. The 7% price mix in the quarter for consumer domestic, how much of that was lower promotion versus less? Because if I just think about that was it 50% pricing, so we're going to 80 are we going into double digit pricing in ’22, when we look at the P&L or again is that with some of that just lower promotion and more matter of timing? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, maybe I'll take that one first. Will give it to Paul, you can you can respond to the question about retailers, but you're up first Rick.
Rick Spann: Okay. So the positive price mix in the quarter was, remember 50% of the price and activity has happened but there is also lower trade spending, lower promotional spending in that number as well. In 2022, we tried to dimensional on an earlier question, and I had said that the 4.5% organic was 5.5% price mix favorability throughout the year. So hopefully that can give me a sense of what it is.  And we said in the release also Lauren that we do expect to be spending back more on trade in the back half of this year as our supply chain normalizes. But Paul any retail supply constraint color you want to give? 
Paul Wood: Yes, Lauren's good question. And I think the difference that we're getting ahead of now is, the partnership with Rick's bonds organization and my sales organization to sit with some of these key retailers and give them a more transparent overview. And in some cases, that meant we couldn't commit to maybe some further out promotions for those retailers that need longer lead times and promote just because of the uncertainty and that inconsistency. I won't comment on competitiveness and where others are. Candidly, it's a little different across you can imagine categories we play in, but I would say the partnership, the communication and communication I mean more weekly and billion-weekly communication, which normally doesn't happen. So if anything, we've tightened at least the understanding and the trust, if you will, between us and the retailer's that could kind of help the burdens in the fines and fees and those discussions. But really, you know, we want to be upfront and make sure that we're not holding them out to dry with a promotion or an end cap and just being transparent. So, not easy conversations but we don't want you to misinterpret but yes, I'd say transparency would probably be the word of the choice the answer your question simply. 
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Farrell. 
Matt Farrell: Hey, thanks, everybody for joining us. We had a spectacular '21 and hope to have another good one in '22. We'll talk to everybody at the end of April after Q1. Thanks for joining us today.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q3 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. But before we begin, I would like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as during this quarter, the company faced the complexities of widespread raw material and labor shortages at our suppliers and at our third party manufacturers. Now let's talk about the results. Q3 was a solid quarter. Reported sales growth was 5.7%, organic sales growth grew 3.7% and exceeded our 1.5% Q3 outlook. The 3.7% organic growth rate in the quarter is impressive, considering the prior year Q3 2020 organic sales growth was 9.9%. So that's growth on top of growth. The adjusted EPS was $0.80 and that's $0.10 better than our outlook. We grew consumption in 12 of the 16 categories in which we compete and in some cases on top of big consumption gains last year. Regarding brand performance, five of our brands saw a double digit consumption growth, and I'll name them for you: vitamins, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, Scent Boosters, BATISTE and ZICAM. And although many of our brands experienced double digit consumption growth, it's not all reflected in our 3.7% organic sales growth as shipments were constrained by supply issues. In Q3, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.3%. Our online sales increased by 2% year-over-year. Now keep in mind, this is on top of 100% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q3 2020 versus 2019. And we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15% as a percentage of total sales. Now as described in the release, Hurricane Ida's impact was substantial, which resulted in limited availability of raw materials and caused our fill levels to continue to be below normal. Labor shortages at suppliers and third party manufacturers have constrained their ability to produce. Transportation challenges have further contributed to supply problems. Now the good news is that over the past 18 months, we have made our supply chain more resilient by qualifying dozens of new suppliers and co-packers, which provides, of course, both short term and long term benefits. And in a few minutes, Rick will tell you about our plans to expand capacity in 2022 with a significant increase in CapEx next year to support our growth plans. Now due to the lower than normal case fill rate, we pulled back on Q3 marketing compared to the prior year, and we expect the supply issues to begin to abate in the first half of 2022. Our biggest issue is wide widespread inflation. We're dealing with significant inflation of raw and packaging materials, labor, transportation and component costs, which is compressing our gross margin. These conditions are expected to continue well into 2022, and Rick will cover gross margin in his remarks in a few minutes. On past earnings calls, we described how we expected categories to perform in 2021. Overall, our full year thinking is generally consistent. Just to name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter has remained elevated in 2021. The condoms, dry shampoo and water flosser categories have recovered and are experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda and oral analgesics have declined from COVID highs as expected. So now I'm going to talk about each business. First up is Consumer Domestic. So the Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.8% and this is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q3 2020. Looking at market shares in Q3, six of our 13 power brands gained share and our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues. I will comment on a few of the brands right now. VITAFUSION gummy vitamins saw a huge consumption growth in Q3, up 24%. Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. It appears that the new consumers that came into the category are staying, because if we look at the last year, VITAFUSION household penetration is up almost 10%. BATISTE dry shampoo grew consumption 36% in the quarter and grew share to over 40%, first time that's happened. Dry shampoo is recovering as stores have reopened and consumers are becoming more mobile. Next up is WATERPIK. WATERPIK consumption declined in the quarter due to the year-over-year timing of a major online retailer sales event. But the good news is that WATERPIK continues to have strong consumption year-to-date and continues to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. In Household Products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry held share despite leading with price. ARM & HAMMER scent boosters continue to gain share, going the other way was unit dose share, which declined due to supply issues. The good news in unit dose is that we are now self-reliant with reliable in-house production. And also in household products, ARM & HAMMER cat litter grew consumption 11%, while gaining 50 basis points of market share. Next up is International. Despite disruptions due to COVID, our International business came through with 2.3% organic growth, primarily driven by strong growth in the Global Markets Group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. STERIMAR, FEMFRESH, VITAFUSION and L'il Critters led the growth for the International business. Now the next one is Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered a very strong quarter with 18.5% organic growth but this was on an easy comp. The prior year quarterly organic growth for Specialty Products was actually down 3.4%. So 18.5% is a really nice rebound. And this was driven by both higher pricing and volume. Milk prices remained stable and demand is high for our nutritional supplements. Now let's talk about pricing. In response to the rising costs, we have already taken pricing actions in 50% of our portfolio, effective July 1 and October 1. The volume elasticities have been slightly better than expected since the July price increases. We will be announcing pricing actions effective Q1 2022 on an additional 30% of the portfolio. That means that as of Q1 2022, we expect to have raised price on approximately 80% of our global portfolio of brands. Due to our expectation of incremental cost increases, we continue to analyze additional pricing actions that can be put in place next year in 2022. Now let's turn to the outlook. Significant inflation of material and component costs and co-packer costs impacted our gross margin in Q3. Looking forward, we expect input costs and transportation costs to remain elevated in Q4 and we expect significant incremental cost increases in 2022. Our EPS expectations are unchanged. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 6% this year. It's important to remember that we are comping 15% EPS growth in 2020. We expect full year reported sales growth of 5.5% with 4% full year organic sales growth. It's also important to call out that we are committed to maintaining the long term health of our brands by ensuring a healthy level of marketing investment in Q4 and in 2022. As many of you know, we typically target 11% to 12% marketing spend. Q3 was 12.3% and we expect Q4 to be approximately 13%. Just to wrap things up, October consumption continues to be strong. We're navigating through significant supply challenges and cost inflation. We expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. We have a strong balance sheet and we continue to hunt for TSR accretive businesses. And next up is Rick to give you more details on Q3.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustments, was $0.80, up 14.3% to prior year. We don't expect any further adjustments to the earnout. The $0.80 was better than our $0.70 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand and higher than expected sales as well as lower incentive comp and lower marketing spend as supply chain shortages were impacting customer fill rates. We also overcame a higher tax rate year-over-year. Reported revenue was up 5.7% and organic sales were up 3.7%. Matt covered the details of the top line. I'll jump right into gross margin. Our third quarter gross margin was 44.2%, a 130 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was below our previous outlook of expansion as we faced incremental pressure from the effect of Hurricane Ida on material costs and distribution. Gross margin was impacted by 500 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution and labor. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 40 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a positive 250 basis point impact from price/volume mix and a positive 120 basis point impact from productivity. Moving to marketing. Marketing was down $10 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce demand until fill rates could recover. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was healthy at 12.3%. For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased to 180 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and lower incentive comp. Other expense all-in was $12.1 million, a slight decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared to 17.3% in 2020, an increase of 310 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. We continue to expect the full year rate to be 23%. And net of cash, for the first nine months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 18% to $653 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital. We continue to expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year. As of September 30th, cash on hand was $180. Our full year CapEx plan is now $120 million, down from the original $180 million in the outlook due to purchase timing. This CapEx move out a year and we now expect CapEx in 2022 to exceed $200 million. Future is bright as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamin. On October 28th, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program up to $1 billion. As you read in the release, this is a sign of our confidence in the company’s future performance and the expectations of our robust cash flow generation. Our number one priority for capital allocation remains acquisitions. And given our low leverage ratios, we have confidence to do both. Through October, we purchased approximately $130 million worth of shares and in Q4, we will likely get ahead of our 2022 planned purchases as well. And now to the full year outlook. We now expect the full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately 5.5% and organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments. We expect our customer fill levels to improve throughout Q4. Turning to gross margin. We now expect full year gross margin to be down 170 basis points, previously down to 75 basis points. This represents an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad based inflation on raws and transportation costs. That was exacerbated by Hurricane Ida. In our prior outlook, we had discussed $125 million of higher cost versus our plan. That number today is $170 million and the majority of that increase in the last 90 days relates to transportation, labor and other increases. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. The $45 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily noncommodity related. [Commodity] spot pricing today is elevated compared to spot pricing just three months ago. And now for the full year. We expect adjusted EPS to be 6%. Our brands continue to go from strength to strength as strong consumption and organic sales growth lap almost 10% organic growth a year ago. And while inflation is broad based, we have taken pricing actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence over the long term. For our Q4 outlook, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect organic sales growth of approximately 2% due to the supply chain constraints and our SPD business to return to a more normal growth rate. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.61 per share, up 15% from last year's adjusted EPS. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.
Rupesh Parikh: So I guess the first here, just with the supply chain headwinds. Is there a way to frame like how significant impact it was on your top line in Q3 and Q4, and just any initial thoughts in terms of the magnitude of impacts early next year?
Rick Dierker: From a top line perspective, organic for the domestic division was, I think, 2.8%. If we look at what consumption was, remember, our fill levels at retail are pretty good, our in shelf, in stock levels are in the mid-90s. We want to be in the high 90s, but are in the mid 90s. The consumption was closer to 6%. And so that just means retailer inventories are depleted to some degree. So you can do the math between the 2.7% and really the 6% consumption.
Rupesh Parikh: And then on the cost side, so you guys mentioned that you expect significant or incremental increases next year. Is there any way to quantify, like as you look at your current spot prices and cost pressures, what significant could mean as of today for next year?
Matt Farrell: Rupesh, I would imagine there will be a lot of questions on 2022 and want us to quantify that. Here's what I would say. Our goal is to offset cost increases dollar for dollar with our price increases. And the 2022 plan at this time of the year is a work in process. And we expect to have, like I said, significant incremental cost increases year-over-year, '22 versus '21. If you look at what's happened so far, in April, we priced up 30% and that was primarily laundry and that was high single digits. And in July, there's another 20%. This is litter, additives, baking soda, flossers and showerheads and that was mid- to high single digits. And today, we're saying another 30% but that's largely personal care and that will be mid to high single digits as well. But as one of my friends likes to say is everyone is chasing a ball downhill. And so costs have continued to escalate, even since the April announcements and the July announcements. So we're going to be revisiting our '21 pricing decisions next year. And Rick could probably give you a little bit of color on maybe a couple of things that are causing the incremental cost increases. But that's probably as far as we would go on '22. But Rick, do you want to add anything to that?
Rick Dierker: Just to kind of triangulate what we're seeing. I would tell you that in our July outlook, if we looked at our Q4 forecast, for example, and you look at the gross margin bridge or even the dollars, we were seeing that inflation was largely going to be offset by price. Fast forward three months and the gap is a couple of hundred basis points. And so that's why we're -- as Matt said, revisiting pricing, that's why we're doing more pricing for other parts of the portfolio. We are going to -- I think it's a no-brainer at this point in time, we are going to assume spot pricing as we move into 2022 for a large part of it that we're at right now. We're going to assume transportation tightness. The good thing for us, though, is as our fill levels improve, that tightness, the efficiency improves. There's still macro tightness but the efficiency of our trucks improved and we're going to assume labor is still elevated. But we're going to do as best we can to mitigate as much as that and we'll give you our outlook in January.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: So I wanted to kind of get into, obviously, the supply chain issues are causing fill rates to be pretty weak. Retailers are obviously looking for more efficient assortment. I wanted to get your thoughts around that, especially as it relates to innovation, because you've got -- obviously, innovation is such a critical part of your algorithm. So as you think about that now and kind of going forward into 2022, maybe you can just provide some context on kind of how you think that's going to play out?
Matt Farrell: We always have a robust lineup for new products we did in '21. We have them ready to go in '22 and we got great ideas for '23. So as you know, retailers are interested in innovation and it attracts consumers to the store increases, footfall. So I think we're in good shape for 2022. The question is, our consumers -- we do think that the balance sheet for consumers is healthy right now. So disposable income is up and savings rates are up. But going the other way is inflation so one headline is the $4 for a gallon of gasoline. As far as the willingness to buy new products and for demand to stay strong, the stimulus has ended. I do think household balance sheets are strong at the moment. And likely, we'll sustain strong demand for a couple of quarters, although visibility is poor beyond quarter or two, as we all know. But we got a good lineup for 2021 and we do think, at least in the near term, the consumer has seemed somewhat flushed and that often influences their buying intent.
Nik Modi: And Matt, if I could just follow up when it comes to -- during the pandemic, consumers are obviously migrating to a well-known brand, exploration drops, people want to get in and out of the store quickly for health and safety reasons. Have you seen exploration actually tick back up, consumers looking for some of those newer, niche kind of [Technical Difficulty]?
Matt Farrell: I wouldn’t say yes to that, Nik. I still think that the larger brands are still winning.
Operator: Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.
Olivia Tong: Two questions on pricing, not surprisingly. First, on the new pricing you [Indiscernible] take. Do you know whether your competition is also taking similar pricing in personal care? And then just a little bit more color on the price increases you already took, you mentioned price elasticity that it was better than you had anticipated. Just curious if you could give a little bit more color in terms of what you had anticipated and what you're seeing with respect to impact to consumption?
Matt Farrell: We are aware in a couple of personal care categories where our competitors have already moved, but we wouldn't call those competitors out on this call, nor would we cite the percentage increase that they had. But there are a couple of categories and I expect they're going to be more, Olivia, where people are already moving in personal care. We moved early on, on laundry and largely household products, our first two rounds. The April announcement and also the July announcement, laundry, litter, additives, baking soda, if you remember. So next up is going to be personal care, but that's as far as I can go with respect to competition.
Rick Dierker: And then on elasticities, I'd say we're really happy where it's at for many of the household products. I think we moved first in laundry as an example. But competition is starting to move. And the elasticities are better than we had expected, which is good. And then litter, when I originally told you about the litter price increase, we assume competition did not move when we did all of our math in our forecast and it's obvious that competition has moved in litter as well.
Olivia Tong: And then in terms of the marketing spend kind of getting pulled back a little bit this quarter because of the in-stock levels. Are you expecting to reinstate that as time progresses? And then also, given pricing plans, fairly decent consumption, obviously, hopefully, by next year, supply chain challenges do get a little bit better. Should we expect fiscal '22 to be a better growth year given all those different factors?
Matt Farrell: Let me take marketing first. So marketing year-over-year is down but it's up sequentially, Olivia. So you may remember, in the first half of the year, we were like high single digits, marketing as a percentage of sales. So we dialed it up in Q3. Yes, it is down less than Q3 2020 but we went from 9% to 12.3% sequentially from Q2 to Q3, and we expect Q4 to be 13%. So as the in stock levels in stores have improved we've dialed up the marketing. And what your second question was?
Olivia Tong: Just around the fiscal '22, just because if you're taking pricing, the consumption is relatively solid and it's supply chain challenges that are constricting you and hopefully, those do get a little bit better as time progresses. Just wondering if you think fiscal '22 should be a better growth year given some alleviation of challenges but also pricing coming through?
Rick Dierker: We're not going to comment really on our outlook for 2022 yet. We'll go through it in detail next quarter. I'd say, yes, there's tailwinds. Matt talked about that shipments have been lagging consumption. We do well in any economic environment, value and premium, macroeconomy also matters. And when we have a lot of stimulus in 2021 that cannot repeat that level in 2022. So those are the brief comments on the outlook.
Rick Dierker: But Olivia, I would say, just to echo what Matt said. We were at almost 14% market in Q3 a year ago and almost 15.5% marketing in Q4 a year ago. Those are well in excess of what we would normally spend in marketing. So those aren't really the right comparable. The right comparable is our Evergreen model between 11% and 12%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: So a couple of things. Just one, you mentioned capacity expansion in the release in 2022 and 2023, and I think you used the word significant. So can you just help give us a sense for the level of spending you're expecting there or what percent of volume you're hoping to unlock? Is that more something that's typical where you're building more capacity each year? Is it really an outsized level of spend versus history? And is that just capacity or are there potential other areas of increased investment also as you look out over the next couple of years?
Rick Dierker: Maybe I'll start and then Matt has something to add. This isn't new news. At CAGNY this year, we kind of alluded to that we had significant capacity investments for laundry, litter and vitamins. We also said it, I think, at our Analyst Day. Typically, we are 2% or lower on CapEx spend as a percent of revenue and I think we had signaled that it would be closer to 4% for 2022 and 2023. Today, some of those 2021 projects are slipping just because of time line and same supply chain challenges we have in providing finished goods also is happening in the CapEx installation market. So I would say that we're in excess of $200 million. In excess of $200 million is our outlook for 2022 and it will be even higher than that in 2023, and that would flow back down to our normal 2% of sales.
Rick Dierker: And Dara, these are our largest businesses, vitamins, litter and laundry. So we've got a lot of faith in the brands. We've got tremendous consumption. So we're real excited about adding this capacity, because it's going to stand us well for years to come.
Dara Mohsenian: And then second, just on shelf space in the US, you guys have done a great job gaining share in shelf space over time. But you're taking significant pricing granted at a time when competitors are also, you're going through supply chain issues here, so there's some product limitations. You're cutting marketing versus original guidance, understanding it's still at a robust level. So just curious for any perspective on if that creates any risk from a shelf safe standpoint, how you think about that? Those are typically not things that retailers like to see. So just how you think about sort of the level of risk given some of the dynamics that are going on in the business here.
Rick Dierker: I don't see the risk, frankly. We're not alone, Dara, as you know, with respect to raising prices, et cetera. So I think it's a level playing field out there right now. And you keep in mind that our growth rate in Q3 was almost 4% on top of 10% growth last year and our brands, our consumption is super strong. And the retailers are aware of that they see the demand for our products. So we're not worried about shelf space losses as a result of our actions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: First, and I make a quick one on new buyback plan. Is the intention to continue to buy back about what you've been doing in recent years or does it maybe signal a bit of an acceleration from where you were before?
Matt Farrell: If you look at our track record, we've done a few hundred million dollars each and every year. And a few years back when cash was built, we did closer to $500 million. So somewhere in that range between $300 million and $500 million is what I would tell you.
Kaumil Gajrawala: And then as it relates to [Technical Difficulty] in terms of raw material costs or other costs. Obviously, we know there's a lot of installation. But to what degree are those numbers maybe increasing at a higher level than they otherwise would, because hedging probably now have started to roll off or are you still hedged and then maybe those roll offs happen at some point later -- some point in '22?
Rick Dierker: I'm going to do my best to answer that. Your phone is breaking up significantly. I believe you're asking about the hedging. We are about 90% hedged for 2021. And as we entered the year, we were significantly hedged, which was a good thing. And as we enter 2022, about now we're about 45% hedged. And of course, there's probably, I don't know, between $10 million and $20 million worth of a benefit from 2021 hedging. And so just as we layer on our new hedges versus that, that's a headwind but that's something that we've known about for a long time and are managing to do. As of right now, hedges are very expensive. So we actually lean towards a lot of the spot market as of right now. The volatility in the market in 2021 has, I think, made the banks less likely to offer up any reasonable hedges for 2022. So that's a quick overview of the hedging.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: So I think just going back to the point about pricing and price gaps. In some of like, obviously, you've done well rolling the pricing and rolling it. And I think that too much point, obviously, you're not alone. But for the most price sensitive categories you compete in and for the areas that you've seen these price increases roll out, any color around the volume elasticity, given the widening price gaps most likely? And related to that, as your main competitor in this segment is increasing couponing, I believe, like coming back from a depressed level from last year. How do you feel about closing the gap in pricing and as well as the fact that at some point, the private labels, I think, have been taking the time to take action there? If you can help us kind of reconcile that.
Rick Dierker: Well, as Matt said, and I mentioned too on elasticities, elasticities are better than we expected because competition has moved. And so we're really happy with that. I think some competitors, as they do more couponing or whatnot or higher trade and laundry, we have added a little bit of trade back in Q4, but we're well below normal levels as an example. So I think overall, Andrea, I would say it's gone better than expected from a price cap perspective.
Andrea Teixeira: But from that roll off of the hedging, the 45% and now you're going to enter 2022 doing mostly spot. So the headwind will be massive and you quoted the $170 million cost pressure. That is, I think, net of hedges. So should we think about that number, obviously, extrapolate that number into 2022. Obviously, that's going to be a much bigger impact. I'm assuming. Is that the way to think?
Rick Dierker: Well, let's just take a big step back. $170 million is versus our outlook, our plan, if you add in -- let's talk year-over-year. The year-over-year number is about $250 million or about 9% of COGS. So that's the year-over-year inflation in 2021. What we're talking about in my comment on the hedging was between $10 million to $20 million, which in the grand scheme of things is a peanut compared to the $250 million that I'm talking about. And so yes, that will be a rollover. Some of these latest price movements will be a rollover. But that's what pricing actions that we've talked about in different categories that we feel pretty good about because competition is moving. And it's not just one category or even within CPG, it's broad based within many different categories across many different aisles.
Andrea Teixeira: So just to fine point that, so $250 million would be $270 million, all things equal. But is that based on spot prices or is that based on forward curve?
Rick Dierker: That's 2021 versus 2020, actual. So it's actual and then spot pricing for the last two months of the year.
Andrea Teixeira: And then the last month of the year would add you around $20 million only on that $270 million or that's more…
Rick Dierker: No, Andrea. It's $250 million for the full year forecast 2021 versus 2020. If we didn't have any hedges, you would add another $10 million to $20 million.
Andrea Teixeira: And then for 2022, it has to be higher than that because, obviously, the beginning of the year, the pressures were much lower than we're seeing now. So that's what I wanted to make sure I understood.
Rick Dierker: We called incremental inflation in 2022. I would not expect to have another year of 9% inflation on top of 9% inflation.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.
Bill Chappell: Just following up on Nik's question about innovation. I guess my question is, you're seeing supply shortages and pulling back on marketing. So we're about to flip as we go to the first of the year, I mean typically, you roll out a lot of new products in 1Q and step up marketing in 2Q. And at the same point, you've said you're not sure or you don't believe that things will be back to normal in terms of supply chain until sometime in the first half. So I guess, does it change? One, what gives you confidence that things improve in the first half? And two, does it change your cadence of kind of rolling out new products and marketing behind those and stuff like that or is everything normal at this point?
Matt Farrell: Bill, what we're saying is that we expect the supply issues to abate, because some of that is in our control. So we do expect -- even though our fill rates today are in the low 80s and they're normally 99%, we think that, that is going to improve over the next few months. So that's a good thing because we're leaving money on the table, because we haven't been able to meet customer orders right now. So as far as marketing goes, typically, Q1 is our lowest quarter for marketing. So you wouldn't expect a pickup in marketing spend in Q1 and it's oftentimes around 9%, 10%. But you're right, new products do start hitting shelves in March, April. So Q2 is off the month of the quarter, when we start amping up the marketing. So that would be our plans right now.
Bill Chappell: So what you're saying in terms of fill rates are improving kind of month-to-month where you get -- I mean just trying to get what gives you confidence that things are better by April?
Matt Farrell: Well, because we're in touch with all of our suppliers and co-packers.
Rick Dierker: And we're also optimistic by nature in that. If Hurricane Ida hadn't happened, we would have been on the road to recovery and further along than where we ended up. We kind of ended up at the same spot but that was largely due to additional hurricane pressures and disruption.
Matt Farrell: Yes, you probably know, Bill. We had seven force majeures. And those chemicals that are coming from that part of the US, it's not just household, all those chemicals affect personal care products as well. So as all of those things get sorted out, and they are improving, just talking to those suppliers down in Louisiana, for example, things are getting better. And as that supply improves, our fill rates are going to go up and we're going to take advantage of the demand.
Bill Chappell: And then one last as you look back at vitamins in particular. Is there work you've done to kind of understand how many of the incremental consumers over the past 18 months are going to kind of stay in the category versus as we come out of this, they kind of go back to their more normal patterns in terms of vitamin consumption?
Matt Farrell: Our work tells us that household penetration is up almost 10% year-over-year. So what we're seeing is repeats of new people coming into the category, repeat purchases.
Rick Dierker: With a high loyalty rate of around like 80% plus, which is great.
Matt Farrell: So if you just look at the quarters, Bill, like Q1, Q2, Q3, consumption of VITAFUSION year-over-year, it’s up 25%, up 10%, up 24%, just big numbers, consistent all three quarters. And of course the tailwind is -- two tailwinds, I guess, one, the wellness trend; two, the transition from pills and capsules to gummies, that continues. And we have good new product lineup in '21, we've got another good one in '22. And I guess the other thing that is noteworthy is if you look at private label share gummies, that has declined in three consecutive quarters. So that's kind of a fun fact, too. So we're really optimistic about vitamins and that's one of the reasons why we're going to be spending a lot of money on CapEx. It's one of the three businesses, we're going to be putting some iron in the ground in '22 in anticipation of growth in '23 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: So Matt, if I could just pick up on the last one, a point of clarification around the iron you're going to put in the ground or CapEx, as you referred to it. So I’m going to have to step up. If I'm not mistaken, about 25% of the business currently goes through co-packers. And you guys have obviously done a tremendous amount of work building out the supplier and co-packer, co-packers that you use over the past 18 months. The point of clarity, is there a rethink on the 25%? Is that still the right number? How much is that going to change on the other side of the stepped up CapEx? And then I have an unrelated follow-up.
Matt Farrell: I wouldn't expect that number to go the other way, Kevin, for the simple reason that, that is our operating model and that we are an asset-light company. So we do rely on co-packers. Yes, COVID illuminated the fact that in some cases, we were a little bit too exposed with sole suppliers or sole co-packers or just not enough options but we've remedied that. So we think we're going to be in great shape coming out of COVID. And keep in mind with respect to our acquisition strategy as well is the same -- that's unchanged too. We still prefer to buy brands and businesses that are co-packed so that we're not wind up with additional plants and additional needs for CapEx. So no change.
Kevin Grundy: Rick, a quick follow-up for you and then I'll pass it on. Just on the fourth quarter guidance, and I guess what I'm trying to better understand the consumption trends are strong. We see that in the Nielsen data. The fill rates sound like they're getting better, which is encouraging. But the organic sales growth guidance of 2% implies a modest deceleration on two year stack or two year average basis. I think you made the comment, SPD maybe will lighten up a little bit. I'm trying to reconcile the improving fill rates, what we see in the Nielsen data and then the guide for the quarter. And I also understand you guys are typically conservative, but just maybe help me better understand that. I'm just trying to triangulate the data points.
Rick Dierker: It's really two things. One is SPD comes back to normal growth rates. It had a fantastic 18% organic growth quarter in Q3. And part of that was because of the comp a year ago, but Q4 comes down to normal. So I'd say maybe half the deceleration in the company organic growth rate is SPD. And the other half is we’re being conservative on the the fill rates. As they continue to improve but we're still assuming they're in the low 80s. And then we said in the first half of 2022, it gets back to normal. So I would just say it's probably conservatism. If great unbelievable consumption demand continues like we just saw in Q3 or earlier then when you have a bigger number times 80% fill rate then that's when you kind of over-deliver on the quarter, and that's what happened for us in Q3, we out-delivered because of consumer domestic. So yes, short story is we still think the fill rates are what impacts us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: I'm sorry if I missed it. But have you guys specified which categories or products are suffering most supply chain-wise, where you're leaving the money on the table?
Matt Farrell: We haven't, Lauren. We said, in general, our fill rate is around 80%. And because of having seven force majeures after Hurricane Ida, and as Matt alluded to, it's household and personal care. So it's pretty broad-based across the spectrum.
Lauren Lieberman: Because one thing I was curious about and it's a little bit tough to ask a question admittedly without knowing which categories are more or less impacted, and recognizing force majeure may well be an industry factor. But what's going on with your competitive set in those categories? Are others on the shelf is private label producers that's kind of stepping in? But just thinking about not denying the strength of your brands, but if we go forward and supply continues to be constrained for a couple of months. Are consumers still shopping the categories or going to other brands and thoughts around risk as you come back into the stock if you've lost some of those households?
Rick Dierker: Let me just make one comment, and I'm sure Matt has some color, too. But we need to distinguish between fill rates and in stock levels. Fill rates are in the low 80s. In stock levels are in the mid-90s. So very rarely is a consumer going to shelf and not being able to buy our product. What's happened is mostly retail inventories have been depleted, like in their warehouses or our inventories are lower. Hopefully, that clears some of it up.
Matt Farrell: And Lauren, the in-stock levels weren't as good earlier in the year. So we've really seen them improve quite a bit, particularly as we got towards the end of the third quarter. So looking ahead, going into Q4, we have a lot of our brands back in the low to mid-90s, whereas earlier in the year, they were not. So I think the question might probably be more relevant for an earlier quarter.
Rick Dierker: And I might also say, we haven't spent as much on trade spending or couponing because we don't want to exacerbate at shelf fill levels as well.
Matt Farrell: And if you look at what we did with marketing, marketing was 9% in Q2, it's 12% in Q3. So obviously, as in-stock levels started to improve, we started to dial up the marketing.
Lauren Lieberman: The pullback also in terms of spend to the degree there is one is more on the trade spend piece in couponing. And as you said, marketing is already rebuilding. So when we talk about them leaving money on the table, or even the rebuilding shipments to get closer to consumption into next year, it's not like there's a major hole that needs to be filled. Because if stock levels are okay and retailers would like to have more inventory, it's not like there's some major catch-up that has to happen when we think about sales growth for the full '22?
Rick Dierker: The thing we go to think about is -- and when we talk about in-stock levels, we're talking about on shelf. Now the hole is in the DCs, the distribution centers. So that's where I think it's hand to mouth and that's where the opportunity is to close the gap between consumption and shipments.
Matt Farrell: And that was my comment to Rupesh earlier. It was really the 3% or so organic in Q3 compared to the 6% consumption in Q3.
Rick Dierker: And Lauren, the only class of trade that's not true in it is Club, because Club has their inventory at their stores as opposed to DCs.
Lauren Lieberman: And then just my second question was the SG&A was down a lot this quarter. You cited there was litigation but also the incentive comp. But that was a big piece of kind of holding the P&L together this quarter, and I apologize for being so short term, but that's kind of -- that's what happened now. So as we look into '22, knowing pricing continues to build. But in the interim, I'm guessing there's less ability to control the SG&A line, if that's fair, given what you have lots of flexibility in marketing, you put so much money to work during 2020, there's a lot of flexibility. But that SG&A line, you run that pretty tightly to begin with. So I was just curious on your perspective on other ways to mitigate some of the cost headwinds as pricing is still ramping?
Matt Farrell: SG&A is down largely because of incentive comp. Why is incentive comp down? It's because gross margin we have in our targets, and very few companies do that, but we do do that. We're actually -- we're very proud that we do that and it's hard in times like this. But gross margin will likely be a donut and so that's impactful on the accrual for incentive comp. So rightfully conclusion that you had, Lauren, SG&A will be higher next year as we get back and hopefully hit a plan with all the levers that we typically do. But we have things that can offset inflation and we have things that can offset SG&A. And the number one far and away next year is going to be pricing and then number two behind that's going to be productivity discussions.
Lauren Lieberman: And it sounds like if incentive comp, we hope goes up next year, gross margin is in a donut on that for card next year, meaning gross margin could be up?
Matt Farrell: Yes, we have 5,000 employees that would like to see that happen.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.
Steve Powers: I think we've covered most of what I wanted to talk about. But just I guess a final cleanup on some of the near term supply constraint dynamics. The cadence of relief that you've talked about, it seems sort of multifaceted and sort of complex. And therefore, I'm assuming that it's more of like a gradual -- a continued, ongoing gradual rebuild into next year as opposed to some kind of cliff or binary point of recovery. So can you just validate that, that it's kind of a more even a bumpy glide path as opposed to some kind of discrete set of milestones that we should be thinking about?
Matt Farrell: I think you asked and answered it Steve, it's not a light switch. So there's not going to be a spike at any point in time. So what we hope to be able to tell you when we get together in January, is to give you a sense for how October, November, December started to build our improvement in fill rates, for example, is what we hope to be able to be telling you the end of January, and then our expectations for the rest of the first half.
Steve Powers: And so I guess from that shipment recovery versus hopefully, sustained strong consumption base cases that that happens, that happen progressively. It’s not like a slight switch as you say and all of a sudden -- sorry, go ahead.
Rick Dierker: Yes, exactly right. It would be gradual over time as different brands recover faster and is a stair step back up to normalcy.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Chris Carey: I guess I'd echo Steve's comment that so many of the questions have been covered already. And maybe in that regard, I'll keep it a bit more medium, longer term. I guess there's this dynamic with the Church & Dwight portfolio where there's a piece that's valued as a piece that's premium. This offers the flexibility to respond to different economic environments, but we're clearly in this period where demand elasticities are basically nonexistent. So I mean, in theory, maybe that means the value end of your portfolio offers relative less value than typically it would. I mean, does that give you more credence to close price gaps to get more aggressive on price gaps? I guess I'm thinking about this 80% of your portfolio is going be pricing in Q1, but you may have to look at more pricing, maybe expand pricing. Maybe you raised pricing. I'm not sure. But I guess it's a bit theoretical, because it's almost like how long this demand elasticity environment lasts, I don’t know, I don’t think anyone does. Maybe just how you see your relatively positioning on shelf but in the context of this value versus mix portfolio?
Rick Dierker: We look at that closely and we continue to look at when you’re pricing up 80% of your portfolio, we're doing a lot of work on what the price gaps are in all the categories where we have raised price and intend to raise price. But part of our operating model long term has always been this round number is 60-40 split between premium and value. And we do think that -- we do want to preserve that and we do want to preserve the price gaps. So consequently, we will always have that ability to perform well in good and bad times. So now to answer your question directly, we'd not be looking to drive these value brands up into, say, mid-tier.
Chris Carey: And then maybe if I could just sneak in one clarification. I think you said that shortages are everywhere, but I think in the past, had said that household specifically laundry had seen some shortages around surfactants. Is that happening? Certainly, share is improving in laundry and on pricing is a part of that mix, is a part of that, I suppose, couponing less couponing as part of that. But are you seeing disproportionate shortages there versus the rest of the portfolio or is it -- as you said, that it's good broad based?
Rick Dierker: As you see share recover in most cases, 80% of the cases, I would say, it's largely supply chain disruption that had happened. So as you see -- so share recovery in certain areas, it's largely because supply chain is improving.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.
Peter Grom: So I know it's kind of early, but I was just kind of hoping to get your early read on the cold and flu season and the impact this may have on ZICAM, kind of going forward? And then I guess, just as it moves into organic, like how should we think about the potential lift to your total company organic revenue growth from just like a normal cold and flu season?
Matt Farrell: Well, as you know, we bought ZICAM at the end of 2020. It's number one brand in cold shortening events, to us today, super high shares like 70%. And the recent consumer trends are really encouraging. You probably saw some of [Rickett's] comments earlier this week. But if you look at our Q3 all channel consumption for ZICAM, we're up about 40% versus 2020. And Q4, that 40% increase in all channel consumption in Q3, that's not the key quarter. Q4 is often 40% to 50% of full year sales. So that's ahead of us. And we did buy the brand back last year, because we thought it had a long term growth opportunity and we do expect it to be a big contributor to sales and profits in 2022, because it's been so depressed in '21. But we wouldn't quantify what we think that might be.
Rick Dierker: We would just say it's going to be a good tailwind if it gets back to normal levels of cold and flu season.
Matt Farrell: We'll give you more color on -- we could probably comment a little bit more on that in January when we give our full year outlook for 2022.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to go back to an earlier statement you made about not lapping or about lapping the stimulus and that not recurring next year. So I'm curious how you think about that in the context of the percentage of products sold on promotion as you head into next year? Any sort of high level thoughts, comments, discussions with retailers in terms of what they may be asking for or kind of how that plays out as we go through '22? Obviously, we're all sitting here with a lot of moving parts, but any sort of color you can give at this point would be helpful on that.
Matt Farrell: Well, look, we did pull back on promotions this period -- promotions and couponing. And we did it pretty early on because it didn't make a lot of sense to be promoting to shelves that were completely stocked. As I said earlier, the in stock levels, particularly towards the end of Q3 and looking ahead into Q4 are now approaching the 90s. So consequently, there is an opportunity to start introducing trade promotion back in 2022. And that is our intent as well. But of course, competitive actions are something that we have to watch as well to decide how much or how little of that we introduced back in, some of that is starting to happen in Q4.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair.
Jon Andersen: There's not much meat left on the bone, but I will go with this. So kind of a follow-up to Lauren's last comment on gross margin maybe being up next year. And I guess I'm thinking about your pricing, your pricing to offset the dollar inflation, not recover gross margin rate. And it also sounds like you're bringing on or plan to bring on new capacity that could add incremental manufacturing overhead at least before that capacity is fully utilized. So as we think about kind of the gross margin outlook for the next 12, 24 months, could it be different than what we've seen from Church over a longer historical period of time, where you've had very good secular gross margin expansion?
Rick Dierker: We're going to defer that question to January when we give our outlook of all the details and all the moving pieces. We're still firming up all of our pricing plans that we're talking about for the balance of the 30%, all those other moving pieces. But you are right, we said we're going to price to protect dollars and not margin and that's we think the right approach, but we'll give you more detail on what we think gross margin will do in January.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
Jason English: Looks like I'm going to close this out here. Real quick. You mentioned in-stock levels are better but service levels are worse. How can those coexist? For in-stock to improve shouldn't you been overshipping as you kind of restore those levels?
Matt Farrell: As orders increase, that drives up your shipments but you could still have a low fill rate. Do you know what I mean?
Rick Dierker: If demand is exceptionally high and you fill it 80%, you can still have -- in theory, you could still have 99% in-stock levels at shelf.
Matt Farrell: The hole is in -- so we may be shipping more, but it's not staying in the DCs. It's going directly to the stores to maintain the improved in stock levels, but you still are stuck with the hole in the DCs and that's the opportunity that's the potential tailwind.
Rick Dierker: So if you just graph the dollars and shipments, as an example, Jason, you would see that we have dollars in shipments that are similar to past practice and historical levels, it’s just the demand is so strong.
Jason English: That's a high-quality problem, I suppose. Looking at the margin lines, lots of questions around gross margin trajectory, but you are coming in with marketing well below your initial budget plan. I think it's somewhere between 70 to 100 basis points or so below. And I imagine, [lendings] are going to look and say, well, gosh, they're going to have to restore that next year, plus your incentive comp because the gross margins, you’re going to have to restore that to next year. And it’s not hard to step back and look and say, gosh, they got like a 150 basis point margin hold fulfilled next year, just on respiration of the SG&A lines. What's the flaw in that thought process?
Rick Dierker: I think the marketing line, we've said many times that it's a range of 11% to 12%. I think in 2020, if you're jumping off from that baseline, that was an extreme -- if we're talking about swimming and diving boards, that's the high dive. And that's pretty elevated, 15.5%, 15.6% in Q4 of 2020, I think, was our all-time high in the history of the company for marketing spend as a percentage. So we were very flushed in the end of 2020. And so we spent incremental marketing more so than we ever had in the past. And I would say our evergreen model is between 11% and 12%. And we think that our 2022 plan will be back within that range, probably the lower end of that range. So that's partly, I would say, is some of the flow is we're not going to get back up to the high 11s in 2022 as an example.
Jason English: I was just asking relative to guidance. I wasn't going to be referring to the tailing last year, but I think you did guide 11.5% to 12% just last quarter. So we're looking at a pretty substantial cut relative to what you had expected last quarter…
Rick Dierker: Yes, you double check the transcript, I think our number was approximately 11.5% for the full year last time.
Jason English: And the SG&A level, we can debate percentage of sales all day long, but at the end of the day, SG&A is kind of a bucket of hard spend. And you spent like 6.20, 6.19 to be precise in fiscal '19, well, obviously, heavy up this year. And relative to '20, it's down but you're still up big versus '21. Why the incremental spend versus '19 to '21? And is there a reason to believe that that's going to grow again in '22 or can we actually get back to something closer to '19?
Matt Farrell: So is your question, why even excluding incident comp is '21 higher than '19?
Jason English: Substantially higher. Yes. And I know you've always kind of put a rate out there, but in terms of percentage of spend. But in absolute dollars, it's grown meaningfully. So I'm really looking for opportunity to offset the marketing reload next year. And I'm questioning whether or not SG&A actually needs to grow or could it actually be lower next year?
Rick Dierker: Well, from '19 to '21, probably the biggest movement is actually probably amortization. We typically are very conservative in some of the deals that we do, do and we don't we typically amortize those trade names over 10, 15 years. And so adding ZICAM into the mix, as an example, would have had amortization between '19 to '21.
Matt Farrell: We acquired that one in December of '20.
Rick Dierker: And look, we're a lean company. SG&A is always lean. We're investing heavily for different things like RPA for our back office and we're looking at centralizing back offices as we go into Asia in a bigger way. But all those things are our nickels and dimes. But for us, that's how we tend to find a way forward. So again, I don't want to get to 2020 too much today, we're happy to go through it in spades in January.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining, and thanks for your interest, and lots of great questions today. And we look forward to updating everybody again at the end of January with our Q4 results and full year '22.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the Company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the Company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the Company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO and when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. But before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our Company going during the pandemic, especially our Supply Chain and R&D teams as during this quarter, the Company faced the complexities of raw material shortages and labor shortages at our suppliers and third-party manufacturers. Now, let's talk about the results. Q2 was another solid quarter for the Company. Reported sales growth was 6.4%. Organic sales growth grew 4.5% and exceeded our 4% Q2 outlook. The 4.5% organic growth is impressive considering Q2 2020 organic sales growth was 8.4%. Adjusted EPS was $0.76 and that is $0.07 better than our outlook. The EPS beat is attributed to two things, one, a temporary reduction in marketing and two, our revenue growth handily exceeded our outlook. Another item that is noteworthy is we overcame a tax rate, which was much, much higher than expected in Q2. We grew consumption in 13 of the 16 categories in which we compete, and in some cases on top of big consumption gains last year. Another way to look at this is to compare our Q2 consumption on those 16 categories to 2019, a pre-COVID year. We have higher consumption in 14 of those 16 categories compared to Q2 2019. Regarding brand performance, 9 of our 13 brands saw a double-digit consumption growth and I'll name them for you. Gummy vitamins, stain fighters, cat litter, condoms, battery powered toothbrushes, depilatories, dry shampoo, sailing spray, and water flossers. Now, although many of our brands delivered double-digit consumption growth, It is not reflected in our 4.5% organic sales growth, as shipments were constrained by supply issues, which we do expect to lessen by Q4. In Q2 online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.2%. Our online sales increased by 7% year-over-year. But remember, this is on top of the 75% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q2 2020 versus 2019. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales. With 70% of American adults having at least one vaccine shots so far, the US has been opening up with consumers becoming more mobile. In recent days, however, it appears that trend could slow down due to the delta variant combined with many people still being unvaccinated. Outside the US, many countries continue to enforce periodic lockdowns and we expect that to continue. As described in the release, we face shortages of raw and packaging materials, labor shortages that suppliers and third-party manufacturers have reduced their ability to produce and transportation challenges have further contributed to supply problems. Besides shortages, we are dealing with inflation. Significant inflation of material and component costs is affecting our gross margin expectations, which Rick will cover in his remarks. Due to a lower case fill rate, we pulled back on Q2 marketing, especially for household products. We expect the supply issues to begin to abate in Q4. The higher input costs and transportation costs are expected to continue though for the rest of the year. On past earnings calls, we've described how we expected categories and brands to perform in 2021. Overall, our full year thinking is generally consistent. To name a few categories. demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter is expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo, and water flossers are recovering and experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs. I'm going to talk about the divisions. Consumer domestic business grew organic sales 2.8%. This is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q2 2020. Looking at market shares in Q2, 5 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share. Our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues. I'll comment on a few of the brands right now. VITAFUSION gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q2, up 10%. Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. So here's a supporting statistic. In the last year, VITAFUSION household penetration is up 17%. That means the brand is now in one out of every 10 households. Next up is WATERPIK. WATERPIK grew consumption 72% in Q2 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefits from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our lunch and learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year. BATISTE dry shampoo grew consumption 37%. Dry shampoo is recovering as stores have reopened and consumers that are becoming more mobile. Similarly, TROJAN delivered 11% consumption growth. Society has been opening up. As restaurants, bars and clubs have reopened, people are hooking up again. Here's a fun fact that might be a contributing factor. In Q2, TROJAN launched on TikTok with explosive uptake from consumers with over 47 million views. Next, I want to discuss International. Despite intermittent lockdowns in our markets, our International business came through with 10.4% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by our strong growth in our Global Markets Group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, BATISTE, and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter. Our specialty products business delivered a positive quarter with 11.8% organic growth. This was driven by higher pricing and volume. Milk prices remain stable and demand is high for our nutritional supplements. The prior year quarterly organic growth for specialty products was 3%. So 11.8% is an impressive result. Now, turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we have launched many new products, which are described in our press release. In the household products portfolio, we introduced OXICLEAN Laundry and Home sanitizer. It's the first and only sanitizing laundry additive that boost stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry gummies, Triple Immune gummies, and POWER ZINC gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity. WATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser, which is 30% smaller with a long-lasting lithium-ion battery. It is specifically designed for smaller bathroom spaces. To capitalize on its earlier success, WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0 with two brush head sizes and two brush speeds and that's doing extremely well. And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with at-home manicure and pedicure solutions. Now, let's turn to the outlook. Since we last spoke to you in April, unplanned cost inflation has grown by another $35 million. In addition to the price increases on 33% of our portfolio that we announced in April, we have just announced price increases on other categories, which means we have now priced up 50% of our portfolio. Of course, there is a lag on the positive impact of these increases, which impacts our earnings outlook. We now expect to be at the lower end of our range of adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% as a result of heightened input costs. Although we expect to be at the low end of the range, It's really important to remember that we are comping 15% EPS growth in 2020. We expect full year reported sales growth of 5% with 4% full year organic sales growth. It's also important to call out that we are committed to maintaining the long-term health of our brands by ensuring sustained high levels of marketing investment in the second half. In conclusion, July consumption continues to be strong. We are navigating through significant supply challenges and cost inflation. We believe we are well positioned for 2022 with the pricing actions we have taken. We expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and in uncertain economic times, such as now. We have a strong balance sheet and we continue to hunt for TSR accretive businesses. Next up is Rick to give us details on Q2.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earn-out adjustment was $0.76, down 1.3% to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn out adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earn-out period. $0.76 was better than our $0.69 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many of our products as well as a temporary reduction in marketing spend as supply chain shortages were impacting customer fill rates, which we expect to recover in Q4. The $0.76 includes a $0.04 drag from a higher tax rate and a $0.04 drag from the VMS recall cost. Reported revenue was up 6.4%. Organic sales were up 4.5% driven by a volume increase of 4.3%. Matt covered the topline and I'll jump right into gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was 43.4%, a 340 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was right in line with our outlook for down 350 basis points for the quarter. Gross margin was impacted by the 480 basis points of higher manufacturing costs primarily related to commodities, distribution, and labor costs. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 50 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a positive 40 basis point impact from price, volume mix, and a positive 140 basis point impact from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis point positive impact from currency. Moving to marketing, marketing was down $5.3 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce demand until fill rates could recover. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 100 basis points to 9.2%. We continue to expect full year marketing expense as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 11.5% in line with historical averages. For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A decreased 140 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and lower incentive comp. Other expense all in was $11.4 million with $3.3 million decline to the lower interest expense from lower interest rates and for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 19.6% in 2020, an increase of 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. You will hear in a minute, this also impacts our full year tax rate. And now to cash, for the first six months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 42% to $344 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments. As a reminder, in the year-ago numbers, there was an $80 million benefit in Q2 related to the timing of US federal income tax payments shifting from the second to the third quarter in the prior year. We expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year. As of June 30, cash on hand was $149.8 million. Our full year CapEx plan is now $140 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter, and vitamins. The decrease from our previous $180 million is project timing related. For Q3, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3%, organic sales growth of approximately 1.5%, entirely due to supply chain constraints. We expect gross margin expansion in the quarter, led by our price increases. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.70 per share, flat in the last year's adjusted EPS. Our strong operating performance is offset by higher tax rate. And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately 5%, organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments. We expect our customer fill levels to improve by Q4. Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be down 75 basis points. This represents an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad based inflation on raw materials and transportation costs. Our April outlook expected gross margin to be flat for the year, and $90 million of inflation from our original guidance. Now, we're absorbing $125 million of incremental costs for the full year. This additional $35 million of inflation drives the change in our gross margin outlook. We've taken another round of pricing actions with over 50% of our global brands have announced price increase. While some of this benefit helps the second half of 2021, most of the benefit is in 2022. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. The $35 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily non-commodity related; transportation, labor, third-party manufacturers and other raw material price increases, make up the majority. Commodities are also up and while we have 80% of our commodities hedged, let me give you a sense of what's going on with major commodities. Over the past few months, second half expectations for resins have moved up considerably. For example, previously in our forecast was based on HDPE being up 30% in the second half of the year, now, it's up 60%. Polypro has moved from being up 40% to now 90%. In addition, transportation costs such as diesel have continued to rise. We previously expected second half diesel to be at 18%, now it's of 27%. Cartons and corrugate previously were single-digit, now they're low double-digit. So that's the latest thinking on commodities and now, we'll move to tax. Our full year tax rate expectations are now 23%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises. This is a $0.04 drag versus our previous outlook. We now expect adjusted EPS to be at the lower end of our previous range of 6% to 8%. Our brands continue to go from strength to strength, as strong consumption and organic sales growth lapse almost 10% organic growth a year ago. While inflation is broad based, we have taken pricing actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence in margin expansion in the back half. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi, thank you, good afternoon and good morning or whatever it is. And couple of questions on the supply constraints, which is are you running into constraints because perhaps demand is better than you thought you can keep up, is it that there are certain pieces within the supply chain that just tightened up, maybe a particular bottleneck that's isolated? Can you just maybe just give us a bit of, maybe more detail on the exactly what's going on there?
Matt Farrell: Yes. The issue is not that we're capacity constrained. We have capacity. The issue is getting components. It can be a raw or packaging materials, chemicals, et cetera. And the reason there are shortages because our suppliers are having trouble getting labor into their plants to actually make their raw and packaging materials and then that's exacerbated by the fact that sometimes you can't get the product delivered and particularly if you're having -- if you're sourcing components or ingredients from Asia and you're dealing with containers, so not a capacity issue. It's entirely due to the ability to get labor and in some cases, it's -- because of the freeze, we had force majeure for a half a dozen of our suppliers, chemicals. If you recall, earlier in the year the Texas freeze, so we're not quite out of the woods on that one yet either.
Rick Dierker: Yes. The only thing I would add to that is the force majeure comment, like we said publicly back in Q1, we had around six of them. We had 10 or 11 this quarter. So just pure disruptions in the supply chain.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay, got it. Maybe just your best guess on, is the labor issue abating at all or are these comments related to 2Q and maybe you're seeing it abate or does it seem -- is this your view that it's likely to be an ongoing thing?
Matt Farrell: Well, it's -- we think it's starting to abate. We're seeing that from some of our suppliers and co-packers. It's -- you have to say that the weekly unemployment supplement is contributing to the labor shortages and of course that's going to roll off in September. So you think that things would loosen up a bit come in the fourth quarter.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And we look at demand planning all the way back to the entire supply chain and all of our independent forecast say that the raw material input costs and whatnot will recover late Q3, early Q4.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to have -- I also have few questions on the supply chain disruptions. Anymore color you can provide in terms of what categories are impacted. And then as you think about the adjustment to your organic sales growth guidance for the year, is it fair to say that maybe it could have been raised. If you didn't have the supply chain disruptions?
Rick Dierker: Yes. That's a fair question, Rupesh. I think could have, would have. should have -- but consumption is really strong. Matt said it in his prepared comments, and I did as well. And so if you look at consumption. It's really high single digits in the quarter and we were closer to 2.8% organic. So, definitely, we are constrained. And if you roll that forward to the full year, then we would have been at the top of the range on revenue. If not for supply chain disruptions.
Matt Farrell: Yes, Rupesh. To answer the other half of your question, if you pick up the release and you look at the schedules in the back and I'm sure you have, you'll see that household products is down year over year and so that's where it's most acute. So fabric care shipments are constrained by supply shortages and we have plenty of demand out there, but the shortages are affecting the household side of the business, which would include both laundry, detergent, stain fighters and litter. So we do expect that we will be out of the woods by the end of the third quarter.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then I guess, some of your retail perspective as you go to -- I know if you look at your leading retail is Walmart and some of the other players -- are they're starting to be out of stocks out there or do you expect to see out of stocks I guess sometime this quarter within some of those categories?
Rick Dierker: I think we've got, kind of live in hand to mouth right now. If we were to get most worse than what we have today. I think we would have out of stocks. I think our great -- most acute area for out of stocks would be OXICLEAN sprays right now, the triggers.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy: Hey, good morning guys. Question for both you on pricing. Matt, I think the comment was that you've now will price over 50% of the portfolio. A couple of questions related to that, but it would certainly seem like there is a cost justification across the board. Have you lead where you can lead at this point? Is there an expectation then that the competition will ultimately move and that's not in the guidance? Maybe just some parameters, a little bit around what has not been priced and why not at this point. And then Rick, maybe just layer on there, what portion of the commodity cost exposure over the next 12 months you think you have captured here with current pricing?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, you hit the nail on the head, Kevin. Price increases, you need cost justification. They are greater in some categories than others, but you also have to keep an eye on the competitive set. So we are looking at the rest of the portfolio now to see whether it makes sense to have a 2022 price increase. And also what we're going to do is we're going to review the price increases that we've already taken on the first 50% and ask ourselves if those need to be revisited. As far as the price increases go we announced in April for laundry, those are taken effect now in July. We know at least one other competitor has said publicly that their prices are going up in Q4. So we may have some temporary price gaps in Q3. But -- and then on the litter side, we raised price there. That pricing hits shelf mid-October. And we know that one major competitor has already raised price as well. So, we've seen that and I think Rick mentioned on the earlier call in April that when we were planning this, we were not assuming that competitors would follow. So the fact that since then in the laundry and litter, we've heard and seen that from a couple of competitors, that's a good indication for us. Rick, anything to add?
Rick Dierker: [Indiscernible] add is on your first question, Kevin, you just asked for kind of a roll forward for 2022. And the simple way to think about it is, when we gave our April outlook, inflation was a minus 300 basis points and that was what was included in our flat guidance. Now, our inflation number is closer to minus 375 that's kind of the entire change from going flat to minus 75 and that minus 375 for the full year, it's kind of indication of the inflation that we've seen for the whole year and inclusive of the first 90, inclusive of the new $35 million that we're talking about. As we exit the year, we think price volume mix will be a tailwind of like 285 basis points. So that's probably a good gauge it is, we're not quite recovering in all of our inflation yet, but we've only priced half the portfolio.
Kevin Grundy: If I could just squeeze in one more guys, maybe just on M&A, the pipeline, and if I think about the volatility, which certainly, I think we would say would be transitory over the next call -- two to four quarters your supply chain, working through some of the COVID volatility et cetera. At least, certainly, that would be the hope. Does any of that give you pause with transacting from an M&A perspective until things kind of settle a bit and I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. To your question, Kevin, would we reluctant to buy a business that had a COVID bump?
Kevin Grundy: Just in general, Matt, just in terms of even buying off putting multiples on NTM sort of earnings and right, just given some of the volatility around supply chain, this COVID flare up here a little bit, you guys have done a fantastic job over the years from an M&A perspective, but even that being said, does that gives you some pause here given some volatility over the next 12 months?
Matt Farrell: Yes, well, look we are wary of businesses that had a big COVID bump. Remember we bought one in December when we bought ZICAM who are one in cold shortening, 73% market share and we bought that for the future because we know that's going to be a strong contributor to sales and profits, not only in 2022 but years ahead. So, yes, we will have a degree of skepticism but we -- I can tell you there are things for sale right now that we are looking at. It's a question whether they're going to meet our criteria.
Kevin Grundy: Got it. Good luck, guys. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong: Great, thanks, good morning. Wanted to ask you a little bit about your view on trade promotion and the levels of trade promotion right now, particularly as you put it in the pricing. If you could just talk through first few weeks of impact of that, I know it's very early days with respect to laundry and but any retail response, consumer response so far that you can see. And then for the second tranche of pricing, if you could just talk to the magnitude of change that you're looking for there, that would be great. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Olivia. So your second question first, we won't really get into the magnitude of change right. We will be very clear next quarter after its end market and we'll disclose some of what we did for laundry. You know, laundry was high-single digits, and so we'll do the same thing for litter and some of the other items. In three months, we'll go through that detail. On your first question, yes with respect, it was sold on deal, it's a little early to draw any conclusions about what's going on at shelf. I think it's important to have the backdrop of Q2 for both laundry and litter. Take litter, for example, year-over-year sold on deal for litter was actually down 80 basis points of the categories right now, promotion in the second quarter around 13% sold on deal. Historically, it's around 19% to 20% and so it's pretty off, it's normal sold on deal percentages. So, but we do know that one major competitor besides ARM & HAMMER has had supply issues as well. In the second quarter, which I'm not going to name. So that may have contributed to the fact that litter sold on deal was down in Q2 for just about our all competitors. For laundry, Q2 was up almost 1,200 basis points to about 32% sold on deal for a liquid laundry detergent. Remember last year promotions were pulled. So it's not surprising that there would be a rebound this year. We actually had the lowest increase in sold on deal, up 700 basis points in Q2, and our lower promotions made sense in the context of supply shortages and obviously going forward, we wanted the price to stick so promotions will also be limited as well.
Rick Dierker: And as to the price increase and again it was early July. so It's only been a few weeks. So we're reluctant to comment, I would just tell you that it's as we expected to date.
Olivia Tong: Got it, thanks. If I could just ask two more questions. First, in terms of your sales guide -- that change to the sales guide. Obviously, some supply chain and disruptions but specialty was actually a quite a bit better. I know it's a lot smaller, but just thinking about your view in terms of the mix of contribution to the top line for the full year. And then, and then a follow-up on the margins, just kind of curious how you're thinking about operating margin expansion long-term, and the leverage you can pull in order to get back on track with respect to margin expansion because obviously, pricing is a piece of that. But mix is not as big of a factor for you guys relative to some of your peers and then you're already still good at overhead controls. So, just wondering how much you can push on the G&A or the S&A as an offset. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Matt Farrell: Yes, Olivia, you squeezed in a multi-port half a dozen questions there as you're walking off the stage. I'll start with the SPD. As far as the SPD business goes, yes I had a really good quarter last year, the quarter was up 3%, this year up 10%. But if you look in the release, you see that price was half of that growth. So we have been raising prices in SPD. It probably were the earliest as for of all three divisions of raising price, specialty products and that's both on the animal side and also on the bulk sodium bicarbonate side. Bulk sodium bicarbonate is oftentimes a contracted business, but the non-contracted line, we've been raising price. So that's a steady business, had a good quarter. It will have a good third quarter as well.
Rick Dierker: Yes, one thing I'd add to that, Olivia, is our outlook for the divisions, we told you last quarter was -- domestic was 4%, international was 6% and SPD was 6%. I think if we had a rejigger that today, it would be more like 3%,6%, 9%, so domestic at 3% largely because of the supply constraints. International consistently at 6% and then SPD now is at 9%. As far as your gross margin question, look, I think you're right. Pricing over the long-term recovers the inflation and so that is a good guy and a bad guy and they kind of wash over time. Look, we have a lot of confidence in our evergreen model and it's only 25 basis points of expansion. So we're going to get that over the long term through productivity, through innovation and through mix and we're doing a lot of work internally on mix actually and using technology to trade optimize and product optimize across retailers and so that work is ongoing, but those are three levers that we have.
Olivia Tong: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Powers: Hey guys, thanks. You gave your comments on the supply constraints in the issues [ph]. Two questions to follow up. First, and you talked about this a bit on litter but is there a way you can frame or clarify the issues relative to the competition, whether you're -- are you saying you're disadvantage on this front and that served as a concern or not really, number one. And then number two, if these constraints endure longer than you expect, is the playbook pull back on marketing for longer and at what point would that become a concern, not saying that it is now, but just, at what point do you get concerned on that front? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, your question about litter, now we…
Steve Powers: It wasn't really -- sorry, Matt -- it wasn't really about litter. I think you had mentioned that you share the same issues on litter as competition, but just generally, is it you or is it, everybody?
Matt Farrell: I think we have different issues. We don't have the same issues as a competitor. We just happened to know that there is some supply constraints that they're dealing with that are affecting their ability to ship. That's all. I think everybody has [ph] got issues.
Steve Powers: Yes. And in other categories, is it -- again, is it everybody or is it you, if the issues differ?
Matt Farrell: Well, as you know, the Texas freeze isn't just us. Most of those chemicals affect lots and lots of companies and lots of competitors. So I would say on the chemical side and transportation side, it's very similar between us and competitors and labor shortages as well. If you have suppliers and co-packers that's universal. So I don't know that there's anything that's unique to Church & Dwight.
Steve Powers: Okay, great. Maybe, Rick on marketing.
Rick Dierker: Yes. On marketing, I think we've been very clear when we look at all of our forecast and all of our internal information, we think we're going to be recovered by late Q3, early Q4. We think the market is good, demand driving activity and kind of healthy that we have put price increases other for the back half. So we want to make sure we're supporting our brands in a healthy way; 5 of 13 brands gained share and part of that was, is lower than normal and part of that's because there supply constraints. So we want to make sure that once that's not a factor that we're supporting the brands like we should and that's the plan. If for some reason, supply constraints last longer, then of course we would adjust as necessary.
Steve Powers: Okay. And then, just real quick on the tax rate, do we -- is the expectation that we revert back lower beyond 2021 or is the higher tax rate to be extrapolated?
Rick Dierker: Yes, the core issue with the tax rate is really, it all comes down to stock options exercised and typically we've had around $2 million stock options exercised every year, If you go back and look for many years. In 2020, it was $3 million and our forecast this year is a little less than $1 million now and so we think perhaps due to the run-up in the share price last year that was really maybe a pull forward every year with the stock options, potentially. So we think that will normalize back to 2019 levels is the quick answer.
Steve Powers: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Bill Chappell: Thanks, good morning.
Matt Farrell: Hi, Bill.
Bill Chappell: So maybe oversimplified but I need that because I'm fairly simple person. Is it safe to say just commodities and input costs were kind of moving higher when you last reported in late April, you're kind of taking a best guess of where they would play out for this year, they kept moving throughout the quarter, but did peak at some point in the quarter. So now you have a lot more confidence, kind of where pricing and costs are for the remainder of the year, is that the right way to look at it?
Rick Dierker: I think that's one aspect of it, Bill. I think that's a good way to say it. And then also, we've had more broad based inflation beyond commodities than we expected. I used the example at our Board meeting, how we've never talked about pallets in the history of me being here for cost impacts and our pallets went up by $2 million bucks in the back half. So it's just really broad based, although the third-party manufacturers are passing on the 2% to 3% to 4% issues that we've been talking about. So I think we have a great handle on it now and meanwhile, what are we doing about it, we've -- we're qualifying a lot more suppliers, just to have backup redundancies and flexibility.
Bill Chappell: And on the cost side, do you feel like there is any disadvantage, in terms of your scale and I see that if you're a $5 billion business, but really, you're fifteen $300 million to $500 businesses. And so, I just didn't know if the suppliers are treating you differently versus maybe a $1 billion competitor or if it's kind of across the board fairly similar?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I think this is across the board. It's pretty broad based. I think if you look at, and you have -- other peers in the industry right now, even some of our European partner's -- peers, then it's really broad based and it's across the spectrum, doesn't really matter if you're a $2 billion to $5 billion or a $50 billion company.
Bill Chappell: Got it. And then one last one, kind of follow up, I don't typically ask about the M&A pipeline. But with the sheer number of specs and consumer-focused specs with the IPO market being fairly prolific. I mean, is it kind of safe to say that some of the traditional $203 million to $500 million revenue businesses that you would target are less likely over the foreseeable future. Just because they have other options. I imagine, most of these companies are getting an offer a day to go public, one way or the other, so just any thoughts there.
Matt Farrell: Yes, there is a lot of logic in that, Bill. There is no question that there are other destinations like SPAC's that companies looking to monetize their investment can take, but based on what we're looking at right now, but what's coming to market and will be at auction, we think we'll have plenty to look at least in the next six months.
Rick Dierker: Yes, keep in mind, similar to private equity. Bill, I mean SPAC's are the same. We have an ability to pay more typically because of the synergies that we can generate. So, that's always now when it's a down in the middle acquisition that's always a great benefit.
Bill Chappell: Got it. Thanks so much for the color.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Thanks, guys. So, first on international and then a clarification on the cost outlook. On the international side, I know it's a smaller portion, but we dedicated most of the time for US, so I wanted to just see like the US, the 6% growth that you just reiterated for international because obviously, that's the long-term algorithm. But given that you had a very strong start of the year and how are you seeing given that you're -- you've got this like more conservative guidance for offline in the back half. So what, and you obviously up against on mid-teens comp for the balance of the year. Are you assuming that it goes negative in the back half? So I want to clarify that. And also on the new guidance, Rick, you were expecting commodities, are you betting that commodities and transportation will ease or you're assuming that they will stay as we see on [indiscernible].
Matt Farrell: Yes, talking about international, for starters. So we've had a good second quarter. We're seeing 6% for the full year and, but we are cognizant of the fact that we see intermittent shutdowns in many of the markets where we have businesses. So we have to keep that and get that in mind, and we get this delta variant as well, which will result in even more -- furthermore expansive lockdowns and effect on consumer mobility in international markets. So that's what tempers our in enthusiasm.
Rick Dierker: And in terms of comps, Andrea, you do have to be mindful of our growth rates a year ago international right. In Q2 a year ago, we were flat, we were 0.6% on organic growth. And so the 10.4% this year, it's very impressive. It's off a flat prior year. Q3 and Q4, last year the back half was mid-teens. So 13% growth. And so if you look at our guidance, it implies not a 5% or 6% growth in the back half. But when you do the stack, It's actually it looks like the international business is very, very strong. And then, your second question was really on the commodity outlook. Well, as of right now, I can I just went through some of the numbers with the latest expectations on resins as an example and paper and diesel. Right now, our outlook implies that the commodity stay where they're at today. We're not banking on a decline or our movement down on commodities for the balance of the year.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay, that's great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I know it sounds, a lot of that supply chain, but I had to just follow up I think in the line of question that Bill Chappell embarked upon. I mean my question, looking at what happened this quarter and what you're talking about is just if there isn't something to consider. In terms of, you guys just running too lean, right, I mean that's been a hallmark of the way that you operate the business, but when you look at this quarter and the conversation on supply and so on, it feels like you've exposed yourself to business risk that other companies are frankly finding their way to manage through. So maybe it's too early to talk about, but just thoughts about how, looking forward, you might want to set up differently so that you can better weather these sorts of storms.
Matt Farrell: Yes, well, I'm surprised that would be your conclusion considering that we're seeing that our full year organic is going to be up 4%, it's going to be the fourth year in a row that we have organic sales of 4% or better. And in spite of the fact that we have $125 million in unplanned incremental costs that our full year range of 6% to 8%, we find our way to 6%. So I would say that the Company has proven that its resilient actually, faced with those kinds of cost increases. And I think it's temporary with respect to the supply issues and we will get that will be behind us at some point, but yes, go ahead.
Rick Dierker: A little bit I would add is, look, some of our competition is vertically integrated in some aspects of their supply chain and some of these examples. We're not vertically integrated. We've chosen not to do that. We don't think it makes much sense. In times like this, it might hurt a little bit, but overall, we're doing the best we can to move our -- whatever we did -- three to four new suppliers and add 90 more, add the flexibility and the capacity there. So our flex capacity as we exit this COVID-type environment is going to be greater than it's ever been before.
Matt Farrell: Yes, it's a good point. I know it's -- that's not a throwaway comment over the past 18 months, we've qualified 90 additional suppliers and co-packers. So that as we, as we come out of this, we're going to be far more resilient and that started last year when we saw where we're that -- how COVID exposed some of the weak links in our supply chain.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks, Rick, Matt, that's exactly what I was asking and looking for. Next question was just on gross margin. I'm actually having a little bit troubles like play around with numbers in the sequential improvement that you're talking about because volume I would think. I know you get pricing coming in, but volume will be a little bit challenge on that price volume mix line, I guess the implied sequential improvement and then also, I guess the commodity headwind. I just -- I don't know if we, the best way to attack it, it might be offline, but kind of the big sequential changes in the gross margin bridge that help you get to and I think you said modest expansion in 3Q that would just be helpful.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So maybe what I'll do for right now is just give you the second half Kind of gross margin bridge and of course, Q3 will be, it will be positive. It will be slightly positive, more of the margin benefits in Q4 as we fully lap or fully have the price benefit but the second half gross margin outlook. The first half is down 230, the second half is up 80 and price volume mix is a tailwind of what we think is 285 basis points. Inflation is a headwind of around 285 basis points. We have incremental tariffs of 35 basis points, which is a little bit better than it was in the first half because we had tariffs starting to year ago. We have productivity programs of around plus 85, the acquisition for ZICAM helps on margin by about 40 basis points and then currency is a bit of a drag. So that's how we get to plus 80 in the back half.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, that's super helpful. And then final thing which is on the incentive compensation call out this quarter. I guess I was curious if that was at the outset of the year, what you had anticipated or is that something that was a true up this quarter and how to think about that in terms of SG&A for the balance.
Rick Dierker: Yes. I know it's an impact on the quarter, it's impact on the full year. It's probably why our SG&A is down and in both cases for the quarter and full year, and that wasn't expected but it's a reality now because we're one of only and were the exception in industry that has gross margin tighter and some of comp and right now, our gross margin is down 75 basis points that was not the plan, that was not incentive plan. And so that has a favorable impact, unfortunately, on the SG&A numbers.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, understood. Thank you so much, both of you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Chris Carey: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to clarify a couple of things around pricing. I think you said your main competitor or a large competitor litter has already priced. Clearly, there is some revenue growth management initiatives by competitors in laundry. And so those are two categories where presumably it seems people -- companies have already moved and then you're moving. So is there a read there that you're comfortable following with pricing, and so you want to see pricing happened in other categories first, I suppose just to confirm whether I heard that right. And then just connected to that, it sounds like pricing in laundry is going okay early days, but you also have supply issues in household and that it sounds like it's mainly in areas where it's like components or could supply chain issues actually have an issue on getting pricing through in laundry if you start to experience some out-of-stocks, so just some clarification and further perspective on some of those line items would be helpful.
Matt Farrell: Yes, Lastly, the pricing has been accepted by the trade in laundry. So that's sort of behind us right now. Litter is ahead of us, that's going to be taken effect in Q4 but we think both for laundry and for litter by Q4, we'll be out of our supply issues. You had a question about raising price and not just in laundry and litter but in other categories, which we have. So for example NAIR, OXICLEAN stain fighters, baking soda, we announced one variant of TROJAN condoms, WATERPIK, will be raising price as well. So, we've been able to -- we're announcing price increases in many categories. And keep in mind that we are the number one brand in stain fighters, depilatories, water flossers, baking soda et cetera. So we do have some strength and the ability to lead there. So, I think that's -- and your other question with respect to the, what are the issues with respect to laundry. I mentioned earlier in my comments that because of the Texas freeze, there's issues with chemicals and that affects both liquid laundry detergent and unit dose and we expect that to be abating as well and I don't expect that the shortages to impact our ability to succeed and pushing through price.
Chris Carey: Okay, thanks so much. If I could just squeeze one and again keep it quick. Your promo and coupon has been rollout lever for Church & Dwight because of cutting it less than some of your competitors, have you exhausted that flexibility that you did have in the P&L in the back half, said another way, I think, you're couponing and promo levels closer to peers or does that remain a lever at your disposal if things get worse?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, my comment -- yes. I mentioned earlier on litter -- the litter category sold on deal is around 12%-13%. So whereas historically it's around 19% to 20%. So we and competitors are all have had depressed sold on deal and with our announced price increase and another competitor has, we've seen price increases as well, we don't expect that to change in the second half. And as far as the laundry goes, It is -- we are up quite a bit year-over-year, 700 basis points. We're not as high as our competitors, nor do we expect to be at least for the next 90 days be as our price increase has to take hold. We don't want to detract from that with promotions.
Chris Carey: Okay, thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: All right.
Operator: Thank you. And that's the last question of the day. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for closing remarks.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. We'll talk to everybody again in 90 days and we'll see how the Q3 went; so talk to you at end of October. So long.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the Company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the Company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the Company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with the review of the Q1 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. Before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our Company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as we overcame raw material shortages in Q1 as a result of the Texas freeze. Now, let's talk about the results. Q1 was another exceptional quarter. Reported sales growth was 6.3%, and adjusted EPS was $0.83, and that's $0.03 better than our outlook. Organic sales grew 4.9%, driven by higher consumption. E-commerce shows no signs of slowing. In Q1, our online sales increased by 54% year-over-year and as a percentage of total sales were 14.8% in Q1 compared to 10.2% in Q1 of 2020. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales. Vaccinations will significantly influence consumer behavior. The U.S. is slowly opening up, which means consumers are more mobile. 60% of vaccinated consumers are optimistic that they will return to a normal or new normal as we are seeing the first signs that consumers are willing to spend more time in stores based on a study by IRI. In contrast, many countries outside the U.S. continue to experience lockdowns. As described in the release, we have been facing shortages of raw materials due to the Texas freeze. Raw material and transportation costs spiked higher in February and were exacerbated by the Texas freeze. We expect the tight supply and higher input cost to continue for the balance of the year. To mitigate the cost increases, we have announced price increases in laundry and across our international portfolio, and we have reduced couponing and promotional spending. Rick will discuss this further in a couple of minutes. At our Analyst Day in January, we outlined which categories and brands we expected to stay elevated throughout 2021, recover from COVID lows, decline from COVID highs and which ones would remain steady. Overall, our full-year thinking has not changed. To name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter are expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo, power flossers and women's grooming are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda, pregnancy test kits and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs. Of the 16 categories in which we compete, 8 grew consumption in Q1, in some cases, on top of big consumption gains in Q1 of 2020. Of those 8 categories, 5 saw a double-digit growth, gummy vitamins, toothache, battery-powered toothbrush, pregnancy test kits and women's electric grooming. Household categories, such as laundry detergent and baking soda were down in the quarter and unable to comp the huge COVID-19 sales spikes seen in Q1 2020. Looking at market shares in Q1, 8 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share within our U.S. Consumer Domestic business, which grew organic sales 5.1%. I'll comment on a few of the brands right now. Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q1, up 24% with the help of the new launches described in the release. It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. One survey showed that consumers who are new to the category had a 90% repeat rate. WATERPIK grew consumption 15% in Q1 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our lunch 'n learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year. Now, BATISTE. While BATISTE remains impacted by social distancing, consumption was up 6%, and we achieved a record high quarterly balance share of 39%, behind our International Women's Day campaign. Now, I want to talk about the International division. Despite European lockdowns, our International business came through with 3.2% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in our Global Markets Group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, FEMFRESH and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter. Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 6% growth, primarily due to higher pricing. Milk prices were stable in Q1 and are projected to increase later in the year due to higher demand. Now, turning to New Products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we have launched many new products, which are described in our press release. In the household products portfolio, we are introducing OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer. It is the first and only sanitizing laundry additives that boost stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. The product is also designed for cleaning throughout the house and on a variety of surfaces. In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry gummies, Super Immune gummies and POWER ZINC gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity. WATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller and contains a long-lasting lithium ion battery and is specifically designed for smaller bathroom spaces. To capitalize on its earlier success, WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0 with two brush head sizes and two brush speeds. And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with a facial cleanser system, a shower wand for a full-body spa-like experience and at-home manicure and pedicure solutions. Now, let's turn to the outlook. We're off to a good start in Q1. We continue to expect full year adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, which is in line with our Evergreen target, despite the heightened input cost. Given our expectations, for consumer consumption, we have raised our full year outlook for reported sales growth from 4.5% to now 5% to 6%. Organic sales growth expectations were raised from 3% to 4% to 5%. And if you look at consumption trends through the middle of April, 14 of our 16 categories were up in consumption year-over-year. Now, in conclusion, I'd like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. Our track record shows that we are positioned to do well in both good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. Categories in which we play are essential to consumers. We have a balance sheet of value and -- pardon me, we have a balance of value and premium products. Our power brands are number one or number two in their categories. And we have low exposure to private label. And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses. Next up is Rick to give us details on Q1.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earn-out adjustment, was $0.83, flat to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earn-out period. $0.83 was better than our $0.80 outlook, primarily due to continued increase in consumer demand for many of our products. Reported revenue was up 6.3%. Organic sales were up 4.9%, driven by a volume increase of 3.1% and a positive price mix of 1.8%. Now, let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 5.1% due to the higher volume and positive price mix. Overall, growth was led VITAFUSION, L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, FLAWLESS beauty products, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and KABOOM bathroom cleaners as well as VIVISCAL hair thinning products. Consumer International delivered 3.2% organic growth due to higher volume, partially offset by lower price and product mix. This was a great result despite European write-downs. For our SPD business, organic sales increased 6% due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume. Milk prices have remained stable month-to-month and are projected to rise as 2021 moves forward. Now turning to gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin was 44.5%, a 120 basis-point decrease from a year ago. Gross margin drag was impacted by 350 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution, tariffs and COVID impacts. Commodities, which were exacerbated due to the Texas freeze were a 90 basis-point drag on margin. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a plus 190 basis points from price/volume mix and a positive 170 basis points from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis-point positive impact from favorable currency. As a reminder, our outlook for the quarter on gross margin was down 50 basis points. The entire variance was related to the spike in commodities and tight transportation market. The good news is for the back half of the year, we expect margin expansion behind the pricing and promotional actions we laid out in the release as well as we start to lap some of the higher inflation and tariffs that we experienced in the back half of 2020. Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $2.3 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brand. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 8%. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to acquisition-related intangible amortization. We also had higher investments within IT and R&D as well as some transition costs from the ZICAM acquisition. Other expense all-in was $11.6 million, a $3.6 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 23.2% in 2020, an increase of 100 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. And now to cash. For the first three months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 57% to $100 million due to higher cash earnings, which was offset by an increase in working capital. Inventory is higher to support increase in sales as we continue to improve customer fill levels. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments. As of March 31st, cash on hand was $128 million. Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $180 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. For Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 4.5%, organic sales growth of approximately 4% and gross margin contraction of 350 basis points as higher input costs continue and we lap artificially low promotional levels from a year ago. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.69 per share, a 10% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. As you read in the release, we did a voluntary recall of selected products within our vitamin business. We expect the EPS impact in Q2 to be approximately $0.04 for the quarter and we are seeking reimbursement by insurance. And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be 5% to 6%, which is above our previous 4.5% outlook. We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 4% to 5%, up from the previous outlook of 3%. Turning to gross margin. We now expect full year gross margin to be flat for the year, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material and transportation costs and the Texas freeze in March. We had previously expected gross margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year. And recently, we have seen a large increase in raw materials and transportation costs. We're absorbing $90 million of incremental costs for the full year. Higher sales, reductions in promotions and price increases across all three of our divisions represented about one-third of our portfolio, offset a large part of the cost increases. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. Our full year tax rate expectations are now 22%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises. This is a $0.02 headwind versus our previous full year outlook. Adjusted EPS expectations continue to be in the range of $0.03 to $3.06, a 6% to 8% increase year-over-year. Our cash from operations outlook continues to be $1 billion, while we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions. As you heard from Matt, the Company is off to a great start, and we expect 2021 to be another strong year. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: Let's start, I guess, on pricing and commodities. Rick, if you can just spend a moment on how much of your commodity exposure you have hedged for the year, I think that would be helpful. And then, shifting to pricing. Matt, you mentioned laundry and your international portfolio. I think typically, the Company will lead in baking soda, contraceptives in OXI. What percentage of your portfolio do you expect to take pricing? How much is in your outlook? I know pricing is a sensitive topic, but maybe just sort of triangulate between how much is in your outlook? And then how much you -- there might be additional pricing that may not be in your outlook, I suppose. And then what are you seeing from competition, specifically in your bigger categories, like laundry and litter and vitamins on the pricing front?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Okay. Kevin, it's Rick. I'll take the commodity piece really quick. Maybe two-part, maybe to give you comfort on the back half gross margin expansion as well. But, we're about 80% hedged from a commodity perspective. And remember, we said if we could hedge those, whatever key 6 or 7 commodities that a lot of the volatility does go away. We do have a lot of confidence in gross margin expansion in the back half as we are lapping some of those higher commodity costs in the back half of 2020. Just as an indication, ethylene, for example, in the first half of 2021, is up 70%. If we keep that current spot rate for the remainder of the year, the back half would be up 30% versus the second half of 2020. So, like I said, we are confident in some that. And that's why we think we have confidence in the back half gross margin expansion as well as the price/volume mix.
Matt Farrell: Okay. And Kevin, your question about pricing. So, we'll start with laundry. So, if you look at over the past 18 months, our competitors have taken price in a different way, generally through changes in ounces. And our estimate is anywhere from maybe 8% to 12% price. And so, we announced in early April that we're raising price. We're sort of discussing that with retailers now. And -- but we don't think we're going to be out of bounds with respect to price gaps in laundry. Your question about how much has been priced, we've got a third of the portfolio. And that would include Domestic, International and also SPD. And in the U.S. business, it's ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, our sheets business, scent boosters, so it's pretty much concentrated on the laundry. A couple of other categories in there raising some price and also just a couple of specific variants within the TROJAN category. Internationally, it's largely a personal care business. So, the price increases are largely around the personal care business. And SPD, in particular, some of our products are being impacted by PFAD, which is a palm fatty acid distillate, which is affecting inputs for one of our products called MEGALAC. So, we've been increasing prices now monthly for MEGALAC, and we'll be doing it as well for some of our other products. As far as -- I think a related question might be sold on deal, so how promotional is the environment today. So, as everyone knows, the household side of the business is the one that's promotional. So, laundry was down 300 basis points. The laundry category is now 300 basis points year-over-year sold on deal. And litter, similarly, was down 500 basis points year-over-year in Q1. We think that's probably going to reverse in Q2, and there's a simple reason for that. It's because last year in Q2, promotions were pulled in these categories. So, for example, last year, in the second quarter and year-over-year, the laundry sold on deal was down 1,700 basis points 2020 versus 2019. So, obviously, a different kind of comp in Q2. So, we think it may be up. Does that help you, Kevin?
Kevin Grundy: Yes. That's helpful, Matt. A quick follow-up on the pricing comment, a broader question, if you don't mind. You mentioned that one-third of the portfolio is taking pricing. Is that to suggest that the other two-thirds are potentially upside should -- and presumably, you're not going to lead, so you're waiting for the competition to lead, because it's probably hard to envision many categories where there's not a cost justification for the price increase. So presumably in that two-thirds, you're waiting for the competition to lead. If you could just sort of confirm that. Is that potential additional offset to the commodity cost pressure you're seeing?
Matt Farrell: Yes. That's the right way to think about it. I mean, the price increases were -- or the cost -- input costs were very acute in the laundry category. So that's where we thought we had to move. But, as far as -- we wouldn't speculate on any other category but what we might do later.
Kevin Grundy: Got it. Just one more quick. I apologize if I'm monopolizing time here. But sort of like $1 million question, Matt. Long-term implications from COVID, understanding still a lot of volatility, a lot of uncertainty in the environment, it would seem like at a minimum, the Company's view would be expect higher consumption in vitamins even as we sort of get through this and looking out to next year. How are you thinking and planning internally? And what could the potential implications be broadly for Church's portfolio? And I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Hang on, Kevin, is your question in the next six months, what our expectations with this…
Kevin Grundy: No, the question's longer term, Matt. The question is, so relative to the 3% organic sales guidance which you guys have pretty consistently beaten for some time now, at a minimum, it would seem like household penetration has and will, to some degree, sustain a higher degree in vitamins at a minimum within the portfolio. How are you thinking broadly about Church's portfolio in terms of shifts in consumer behavior as a consequence of the pandemic, focus on health and wellness, et cetera?
Matt Farrell: Well, certainly, the focus on health and wellness is going to benefit not just our gummy vitamin business, but our WATERPIK business, which has been just a high single-digit grower perennially since we acquired the business. I think what you're going to find is that 2021 is going to be kind of a reset, that as we live with COVID this year, we'll be able to grow from there. But, we have such a broad portfolio, both in household and personal care. We do think that we're well-positioned, frankly, for '22 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Yes. I want to go back just to basically coming back for the categories that are kind of more impacted by mobility. What are you seeing now? And then, as a follow-up to the recall, what is the -- obviously, you called out for $0.04 impact and you're trying to get insurance payback on that one. Is there any additional potential charges there? And have you had any issues with the shelf space or anything else for the balance of the year on the vitamins? Any comments on that or any potential changes on production or any disruptions that we should be thinking of? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So, I'll let Matt take the categories and mobility, and I'll just talk about the insurance and the recall. So, trying to be very clear that the potential impact is up to $0.04. We think it's relatively limited to that. To our knowledge, there has been no additional shelf reset issues. This was a small window of production. We've been very clear in the release that we've talked about. And that's kind of the extent of it.
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as the categories go, just give you some color on that, the gummy category was up 19% in Q1. And even depilatories were up 9%. Again, people who discovered depilatories a year ago were using at-home solutions. So, those are a couple of examples, two of the categories, we expect it to be elevated this year. Litter is another one, and there's 6% more households that have cats. So, that's sort of the tailwinds for litter. And there were a number of categories we expected to recover, for example, water flossers. Water flossers was up 29%, just the category in Q1. And even electric grooming was up 3% in Q1. Dry shampoo was down 1% in Q1. So it's way better sequentially. And we have -- as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we had a record share and we grew sales in Q1 year-over-year in dry shampoo. And as far as the ones that will decline, baking sodas already start to decline in Q1. Toothache as well was off 3%, that category in Q1. And also cold shortening, as Rick made reference to the ZICAM category, was down 70% in Q1. So, that gives you a little bit of color on what's going on in the categories.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Andrea, I think Matt's commented in his prepared remarks, about 13 of 16 categories being positive in April, and that's pretty broad-based across household and personal care. So, all those social distance impacts are starting to mitigate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Chris Carey: So, a couple of questions. Just first, on the back half gross margin expectations, I guess, it feels like something like 225 basis points average midpoint of gross margin expansion versus 2020. I appreciate your comps, appreciate your lower promos and pricing. But it's also, I guess, implying a slightly higher gross margin level than even in 2019, despite this higher inflation environment. I wonder if you can just -- maybe, number one, is that a fair way to look at it? And then number two, maybe just unpack that a little bit. How much of that is maybe lower promo, the mix of the business relative to 2019, higher pricing levels? Just anything you might think relevant to better think through that dynamic. And then, I have one follow-up.
Rick Dierker: Yes, sure. And I'll do it two ways. The first way, I'll just give you some of the details of the full year outlook. Remember, in New York, in our annual -- or at CAGNY, we gave you a full year outlook on gross margin, gave you the pieces. So, I'll do that again, and then I'll kind of bridge it to you. So, the full year outlook for margin is plus 200 basis points for price/volume mix, plus 120 basis points for productivity. So, those are the two big tailwinds. Price/volume mix, for example, is a lot higher than it was, given all of our expectations for, number one, lower promotional spending but higher pricing and really baseline volume is doing better than we expected. Then, we have inflation down 300 basis points. And then, tariffs down 40. M&A, up 20. That's how we get to zero. Now, if you take a step back and you think, well, the first half of this year, to get to zero, the first half is going to be down about 235. And the back half is going to be up about 235. That's a delta of about 470 basis points. So, why are we convinced that we can go from the first half down to the second half up? 200 basis points of that 470 is because of price/volume mix, those are the actions that we took -- we talked about. The other 300 basis points is really cost related. Inflation, I gave an example in relation to Kevin's question, that ethylene, for example, is up 70% in the first half of 2021. HDPE is up 85% in the first half of 2021. Ethylene is only up 30% in the back half. We keep current spot levels. HDPE is only up 50% if we keep current spot levels. We're lapping tariffs, right? We had tariffs in the year ago numbers in the back half. We had some higher COVID costs in the back half of 2020. So, those are -- that's a little bit more color, but I just wanted to walk you through.
Chris Carey: Okay. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up would be on the vitamin category. So, I know that this was -- has been approached a few different ways already just from a category growth and higher per capita consumption perspective. But, it's not just that, right? I mean, you outperformed the category, I don't know, at least in scanner roughly 50 points, maybe a little bit less in 2020. And the relative outperformance has certainly sustained, not that high of a level, but it certainly sustained on a year-to-date basis. So, like there's clearly a pretty significant share gain story here, too, and asked different ways in the past. But, can you just offer a little bit of perspective on exactly why you think that's the case? Whether that's the incremental capacity that you had already invested into, whether you think your product SKUs or the price tiers or the specific subcategories that you're in are particularly relevant in the current environment? Just broadly, what do you think is contributing to the relative outperformance in a category that's doing quite well?
Matt Farrell: Okay. Well, remember, in the gummy category, we have number one brand. So, let's start right there. We know the transition from pills and capsules continues to gummies. I mentioned earlier that household penetration is up. So, the households that were already buying VITAFUSION L’IL CRITTERS gummies are taking more, and where new consumers are being attracted to the categories. So, we stand the benefit from that being the number one brand. We've had a lot of success with new products over the last couple of years. So, we're able to spread out on shelf. And something else, too, is you may recall from earlier calls that we had third-party production come on line late in 2020. So, our end stocks are way better right now. So, a combination of all those is what's going to sustain the elevated consumption in 2021.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.
Rupesh Parikh: So, I wanted to go to the International segment. So clearly, Q1 was impacted by some of the European lockdowns. I was curious how you guys are thinking about it for the balance of the year. And do you still think a 6% type growth rate is achievable for that segment?
Matt Farrell: Yes. So, on a full year basis, we're still expecting 6% from International. The engine for International growth in the last few years has been the Global Markets Group. So, that does spread your risk quite broadly across many regions around the world. So, we're not wholly dependent upon the countries where we have operations. And you may recall that Global Markets Group is about a third of our business, and it's been growing at 15% or better for the last 4, 5 years. So, we think that will be sustained in the 2021, Rupesh.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And just to give you a little bit more color, Rupesh, our outlook in February for organic was 3%, and that was 2% domestically, 6% internationally and 5% SPD. Now, we're thinking it's closer to 4%, and that's 6% internationally and 6% rest.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then, maybe just one follow-up question. So, on ZICAM, it looks like -- I think if I'm reading the numbers correctly, that you guys took down your expectations for ZICAM this year. And clearly, everyone is calling out the cough and cold challenges. So, I don't know, as you guys look out this year, next year, like do you think -- would you expect the business to be back on track, I guess, next fiscal year?
Matt Farrell: In 2021? Yes, absolutely. Look -- I mean, it's common knowledge that the incidence of flu and cold and cough is way down. So, it's affected many, many brands in the category. We remain focused on the fact that we have the number one share, and we had a 73% share in cold shortening. So, it is a strong brand. We bought it for the long term, and we do expect it to be a contributor to organic growth, particularly in 2022 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: I’ll ask a question maybe about stimulus and the impact on demand. In particular, you mentioned water flosser strength -- water flossers have been very strong. We've also heard some pretty strong device sales at Procter & Gamble, and this morning, Keurig Dr Pepper. Do you think there's maybe something in the figures that we're seeing which are very strong that is a bit less sustainable because of the impact of stimulus?
Matt Farrell: I wouldn't think that that would apply to water flossers just because of the growth rate that we saw beginning in 2017 when we first bought the business. So, it's a high single-digit growth for the past several years, and we have so much opportunity internationally. That's where all the growth is going to come from long term.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I do think that -- remember, we're comping over periods of time a year ago that we're just super depressed. And nobody was in retail stores and are doing shopping for devices. So, I do think it’s also a comp.
Matt Farrell: Yes. It's a super easy comp year-over-year. So, I wouldn't be swayed by the fact that the category might have been up 29% in Q1. But long term, it's going to be a grower for Church & Dwight.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Outside of water flossers, any feel on impact to stimulus?
Matt Farrell: Well, look, I think this stimulus can affect virtually every category. I mean, the way to think about the economy, the way we think about it is, savings rates are up. Now, stats that I've seen is 13% of disposable income. And the average for the last five years is between 6% and 8%. And certainly, stimulus checks are helping those in need. There's labor shortages, right? So, there's -- more jobs are available and average hourly earnings is up. So, I think all of that suggests that the household balance sheets on the consumer is healthier and getting healthier. So, I think that benefits all of our categories.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay, great. And then, just a very quick one. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion about raw material prices and transportation pricing and stuff, but we're also hearing about kind of real supply issues that maybe just can't get what you need. Is that impacting your business anywhere at all?
Rick Dierker: Well, it certainly does, right? I think, I gave the example of the Board the other day that in a normal year, we might have one force majeure for one of our suppliers. In the quarter, we had six. So, there is tightness in supply. Our ops and R&D teams are doing a great job getting substitute suppliers or working with suppliers to get through that -- have largely on cap. There's always stuff we can hand to mouth on. But by and by, we've announced everything most.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.
Bill Chappell: Just a follow-up on one of Kevin's 23 questions, on pricing. In terms of timing, P&G had said that they were looking at pricing kind of in September, I think you're talking about a little bit sooner. So, do you think there's any risk of kind of price gaps being extended kind of over the summer before everybody kind of pushes it through?
Matt Farrell: The timing for our price increases is starting in July, Bill. Is that what you're trying to address?
Rick Dierker: And Bill, I think what Matt was trying to allude to before is, some of the compaction activities that happened with some of our competition kind of means that our price gaps aren't really that aligned versus historical levels.
Bill Chappell: Got you. So, you see everybody kind of -- in terms of the competitive front, everybody kind of taking price in lockstep at the same time?
Matt Farrell: No, our decision with respect to raising price in laundry was unilateral and was driven by the cost increases that we've been experiencing. My reference was just simply the fact that, hey, over the past 12 months or so, our competitors had raised their prices by reduction in ounces and things like that in their products. So, consequently, we didn't see that raising prices on our part was going to create a difficult gap for us in pricing.
Bill Chappell: Got it. And then, just, can you give a little bit more of an update on where you see the FLAWLESS franchise? I mean, since you bought it, there hasn't been a normal environment from, bed bath issues to supply issues, to COVID, people staying at home, to somewhat kind of return to normal. I know, it seems like on shelf it's gotten better positioning at retail more with the shaving kind of category. It seems like you've expanded some SKUs. So, it's a bigger block when you walk through the retail orders. But kind of any thoughts ex kind of the COVID bounce back you see on that franchise?
Matt Farrell: Yes. We've talked about this in the past. And you're right, we've kind of gone sideways since we bought the business for a variety of reasons. When we bought the business in 2018, it had net sales of $186 million. And then 2019, $180 million, and then last year, $171 million. So, this year, we expect to be up approximately 20%. And the reason why we believe that is because we've got a nice array of new products to go with our existing products. And I mentioned those in my remarks, got a body cleanser, face cleanser and some mani, pedi products, which are really good. Plus, we've got influencers now that are getting behind the product. So, notably, Ashley Graham and Dove Cameron. We also have a celebrity Halle Berry, who is pitching FLAWLESS. So, I think -- and all of those are hitting in 2021. So consequently, we're optimistic about the future for FLAWLESS.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit the two things. And the primary thing is the driver of the change in outlook for Consumer Domestic from 2% to 4% growth. I guess, one, to what degree is that greater optimism on how well the vitamin business holds in? And secondly, how does that relate to what we're starting to see in the Nielsen data, which is that market shares in laundry are down and softening and it's not multiple periods, but now we're talking about going into a pricing environment. So, just curious on your thoughts on laundry market share performance and how that ties in again with that change in outlook to a more optimistic view on Consumer Domestic. Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. I'll take the -- just change in the organic outlook and what brands are driving it and Matt can add on. So, Lauren, it's really two or three things that are driving the confidence and the strength in the outlook from 3% to 4.5% as the midpoint. Vitamin is a big one. WATERPIK is doing exceptionally well. PTK our pregnancy test kit business is doing well. So, it's kind of broad-based. Those are all -- those three that were certainly helping raise our outlook. Now, in terms of laundry, real briefly, we review share and information all the time. Really, there's two things. Really one primarily is unit dose. Unit dose is down slightly in share. And that's not because consumers aren't choosing to buy our product. It's because we continue to have a transition from making that outside to bring that in-house. And so, outside supply is very tight at the moment. But, the good news is, we are in the ramp-up stage right now to bring everything in-house. So, a short term blip.
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as the laundry category, Lauren, if you look at Q1, ARM & HAMMER gained share; XTRA did not. We have been prioritizing ARM & HAMMER for quite a few quarters now, throughout the pandemic. We do expect that shares could be impacted certainly by our actions with respect to price. I mean, that's pretty normal. So, how competitors react to that is unknown. And certainly, if competitors were to raise price or reduce promotions, less sold on deal, obviously, that could affect our shares as well. But unpredictable right now. But, we're committed to raising price starting July 1.
Rick Dierker: Yes. I'll also give you an optimistic comment. All of our assumptions and our outlook include assumptions that our competition doesn't follow-up. So, we've taken down the volume on the elasticity and everything else. So, that's kind of a conservative way to do it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.
Steve Powers: So, just building on that last comment on the elasticities. You've got momentum in brand strength. It seems like you've approached it conservatively relative to the competition. But, at this point, as we listen to so many CPG companies talking about raising price, either already having done so or pricing to come, the whole -- the majority of the consumer shopping basket seems like it's poised to be going up. So, just -- can you talk about how that factors into your thinking and relative cross-category elasticity that might benefit or complicate your scenario analysis?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Hi. It's sort of an umbrella statement, Steve. We've pointed out to investors for years that we have a balanced portfolio between premium value. And when you have number one brands, typically, you're going to fare better in difficult economic times than companies that do not have number one brands. So, we like where we are right now, going forward. We think we're in a good position.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And a lot of our brands are value brands, and even in the laundry example, despite any increase, the price gaps are in line with historical levels and are great values compared to competition.
Steve Powers: Okay. Fair enough. I guess, there's been just a tremendous amount of volatility in shipments and consumer takeaway patterns as inventories rebalance, both at retail and I presume in household pantries. As you try to cut through that -- those dynamics from where you sit, do you have a sense of how actual consumer usage of your brands or your categories is trending today? And I don't know what the right benchmark is, whether sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year versus 2019 or a year ago. But just any benchmark on actual usage that might give us more insight into your confidence in raising the full year outlook?
Matt Farrell: Just based on looking at consumption patterns in the categories and consumption equals usage. I wouldn't point to pantry loading or panic buying anymore. I think, it's a steady state now, Steve.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And just to add to that, we talked about in the release about personal care categories that are up double digits in consumption, but partly because there's low comps a year ago. But gummy vitamins, as an example, Matt referenced, it's growth on top of growth. And if you look at most of our categories and whatnot, it's growth on top of growth, because April last year, we grew, but April of this year, Matt just said, 13 of 16 categories are up. So again, growth on top of growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: So, there's been a lot of talk about declining birth rates, and I noticed in the release and the commentary during the call, you called out positive pregnancy test kit trends. So, I'm just curious, is this a relation to just easy comparisons, or do you think there's something else going on that happened over the last 12 months as we're all locked up in our homes?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I think, one way to look at it is, if you look at the period like February, March, April last year, that was down versus 2019. So you sort of have easy comps year-over-year. And when you look at kits in the first quarter, we said the category is actually up about 23%. And that's one of the categories we thought that would fall back a bit in 2021. So, I think best case, maybe it doesn't fall back and maybe it's flat year-over-year. But it's -- one other fact that I could give you, Nik, is that typically, if you're in a recession, the birth rate decline. I mean, I think in the last people maybe thought [Technical Difficulty]. Clearly, we are not. So, the category could be better than we [Technical Difficulty].
Nik Modi: Great. And one other question, Matt. I was just thinking about how more and more of these kind of testing kits that you can do at home to diagnose a lot of things, like in terms of what you should be eating and what kind of vitamins you would need and things like that. And I'm just curious, now given that you're already in that business, have you ever thought about expanding the portfolio to deal with other types of diagnosis?
Matt Farrell: Nik, I think you have a future in new products. I think that's exactly the types of things that we'd be looking at. And of course, we have a great brand name at first response that we certainly put in other categories, but yes.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
Jason English: I wanted to come back to the gross margin question. I think, it was asked earlier, because I don't think you fully answered it. Your guidance suggests that you're going to hit a pretty high gross margin in the back half. In fact, going back over the last 10 years, it will be the highest back half margin you've ever achieved, which in context of the environment, seems surprising. So, I was hoping you could explain, like why structurally you're going to be at a higher margin, even with these cost pressures? And then, the second related question is, gosh, if you can hit all-time high margins in the back half of this environment, what is the right margin for this portfolio? Street’s out there looking at fiscal '23, maybe you're 46, 46 Street. Do you think with the portfolio you have today, your normalized gross margin rate should be in the 47%, 48% type range?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Hi, Jason. I thought I gave some context to it. I hear you on absolute numbers. I think, I'm trying to explain that we're going to -- we have a lot of confidence in being up in the back half. And part of it was the comp on inflation, the comp on COVID, comp on tariffs. But, underlying that, remember, all the things we talk about with our Evergreen model are certainly true, right? Our productivity program over the last couple of years has almost doubled in relation to where it was just five years ago. So, we have a new capability that's offsetting these things that has been masked for a period of time because all this inflation, all these tariff discussions, all these COVID costs. So, that's certainly coming to bear in just a great way. MPD, as an example, when we buy businesses that have higher gross margin and simply add as well. So, ZICAM, even though, as an example, that revenue number will be lower than we had hoped for because there's zero cold and flu season, the margin impact is still a tailwind. So, all those things that are structural are also tailwinds. I think, over the long term, we have a lot of confidence in the Evergreen model, expanding gross margin. We've got to get past all these one-timers, like tariffs and whatnot. But I really do believe that we have more upside, more room to run. And so, I do think that we're going to be into the higher 40s over the long term.
Jason English: Okay. I appreciate all the year-on-year stuff you gave. But just sequentially, forget about year-on-year, you've got a cost structure in the first half. Do you expect it to be a lot lower in the back half?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So, not year-over-year, but just sequentially, do we be lower? Right now, like all of the inflation, as an example, we are assuming that it's kind of a spot pricing. We've locked in, like I said before, about 80% of the commodities. So, it's really the absence of higher inflation, the absence of higher tariffs, the absence of higher COVID costs, in theory COVID costs should actually help us in the back half. We don't have the same extent. And all those things help. But then, we're going to get the positive price/mix that's new to the portfolio. That is incremental pricing on those brands that Matt talked about. And then, the incremental productivity program that we always talk about as well in the M&A tailwind. So, those are the kind of the things that are structurally higher.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Hey, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Obviously, we're always available for follow-up questions. And we'll talk to you again in July.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-29 10:00:00) =====
Matthew Farrell: Thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to begin with the safe harbor statement. I recommend that you read it at your leisure. We have an entire management team on the call today available for Q&A after the formal pitch. We have a lot of slides and several presenters, but I'm going to give you the short story upfront. 2020 was a turbulent year. We emerged from 2020 much stronger as a company. We like to say that we do our best work when we're in a jam. That's true for 2020. We protected our people. We found a way to run the plants and warehouses safely. We set production and shipping records. We figured out how to make hand sanitizer in our U. K. plant. We operated the company with 2,000 remote employees. We pivoted our marketing messages to support a 60% increase in e-commerce sales. We installed new packaging lines with the assistance of off-site engineers using Google Glasses. We added overflow warehouses. And we validated new suppliers and co manufacturers. In our communities, we delivered masks and hand sanitizers to hospitals where we live and donated to food banks. And recently, our Mason City, Iowa plant loaned an ultra cold freezer to a local hospital to store the COVID-19 vaccine. Consumer demand drove huge sales growth, which enabled us to overcome significant incremental COVID costs and incremental U.S. government tariffs, but it also gave us the opportunity to invest in our future, which we did in the second half. Looking ahead to 2021, we are optimistic that the vaccine will help the global business environment. We operate in many categories, and we do expect pluses and minuses, depending on the category. All in, we expect to deliver 3% organic sales growth and 6% to 8% EPS growth in 2021. And this is on top of almost 10% organic growth and 15% EPS growth in 2020, which exceeded our 2020 outlook when we last spoke in October. Our evergreen model is intact. Before we start the formal part of the program, here is a brief video that is a look back on 2020. [Video Presentation] Okay. Here's today's agenda. I'm going to begin by describing who we are as a company. I'm going to be followed by Britta Bomhard, who's our Chief Marketing Officer. Britta is going to talk about the categories, how they performed in 2020 and how we expect them to perform in '21. Steve Cugine is going to come up and tell us about our new products in '21. Steve Cugine, by the way, will be retiring in the middle of '21. Steve has had a spectacular career with Church & Dwight spanning over 20 years. For the past 7 years, he's been running our international business, which has been a stellar performer. And Steve is going to introduce Barry Bruno, who has been with the company for a number of years, and he has been Steve's right-hand man in growing the international business. So I'll give him a warm welcome today. I'm going to come back and talk about the animal productivity story, as well as how we run the company and also talk about our M&A platform. We're going to wrap up with Rick Dierker, our CFO, to run us through the financials. Now who we are? Whether you've been a short-term, 1-year shareholder of Church & Dwight, 3, 5, 10 or 15 years, you're very pleased with our performance. We have been a stellar performer in the CPG space for many, many years. We're known for our consistency. And one of the reasons for our consistency is our evergreen model. Every year, we expect to grow our top line organically 3% and our bottom line 8%. That's true in '21. That will be true in '22, '23, '24, '25. You might ask, how has that been working out for you? Well, if you take a look back over the last 10 years, you'll see that we've exceeded the 3% target every year, except 2013 and 2017, with respect to 8%, 8% EPS, you can see over many, many years, we're consistent. So Church & Dwight is a consistent performer. We have an evergreen model that is very familiar to all of our existing shareholders, 3% top line, 8% bottom line. Now where does this 3% organic growth come from? Well, 2% from the U.S., 6% from international and 5% from specialty products. This is our evergreen target, but it also happens to be the targets for 2021. We expect to deliver these 3 numbers for each of those divisions in '21. We focus on power brands. We have 13 power brands in our company that are displayed here on this chart. And those 13 power brands deliver 80% of our revenues and profits. And we're very balanced as a company. About half of our consumer business is in household and half is in personal care and we have a small specialty products business, which is a combination of bulk sodium bicarbonate and animal productivity products. We have a nice split between premium and value, 58% premium and 42% value. What this means is we operate and perform well in virtually any economic environment. With respect to our geographic split, we have a lot of room to grow internationally. We're largely a U.S. company. Only 17% of our consumer business is international. So lots and lots of runway, that's going to generate a lot of growth for us in future years. One of our big advantages is that, we're nimble. We're small. We only have 5,000 employees. We have the highest sales per employee of any CPG company. And it helps us 3 ways: quick decision-making, easy communication and ability to adapt. And the ability to adapt was highlighted in 2020 when you saw how we reacted to the pandemic. We have a long history of growth through acquisitions. If you went back to the year 2000, the only brand we owned was ARM & HAMMER. We were only $800 million in sales in the year 2000. In '21, we're going to cross $5 billion. And of those 13 power brands, 12 of them were acquired since 2001. If you go back just a few years, in 2015, we were a laggard when it came to online sales. Less than 1% of our sales were online. At the end of 2019, it was 8%. At the end of 2020, largely due to COVID, it's over 13%. So we regard us as a leader now with respect to e-commerce. We have a low exposure to private label, only 12%. And if you look at the categories, there's only five of our 17 categories where we have significant private label share. And those shares have been pretty stable over the last five years. Now, I'm going to bring up Britta Bomhard, our Chief Marketing Officer, to take us through the categories in the U.S. business.
Britta Bomhard: Welcome to our biggest business, Consumer Domestic, with over $4 billion in sales. As you have heard from Matt, we plan to deliver another year of growth in 2021 on top of an outstanding performance in 2020 and in line with our evergreen model. There are five distinctive drivers for growth in 2021. Number one, tailwinds on vitamin gummy category growth, accelerated by strong brand VITAFUSION. Second, WATERPIK. Despite dental offices and many retailers being closed for part of the year, we sold slightly more power flosses in 2020 than in 2019. Removing these roadblocks, growth will be even stronger. Three, flawless sales will benefit from new products, a great influencer boost and a rebound of footfall. Four, some brands will rebound where social distancing really impacted sales. With vaccines coming, consumers will socialize more. And five, last, but most importantly, we strengthened our brands and improved our media spend effectiveness. We create brands consumers love. 2020 was a year of dramatic changes how consumers use media, which allowed us many tests and learn experiments, feeding our predictive data models and giving us confidence that our media dollars will be again more effective in 2021. But let's start with tailwinds. We are in the right categories. We saw growth in 12 of our 17 categories, average 9.8% overall. We saw an over 50% growth in vitamins, double-digit growth in baking soda and single-digit in many other categories. The only category of double-digit decline is power flosses and that is in the Nielsen universe. This is important, as Nielsen only measures about one-quarter of power flosses sales, and I will show you numbers from the whole universe later. We have high expectations for category growth in 2021, and I will speak to them in more details. Four categories will stay on elevated levels. Five categories will come down from COVID peaks, but some to higher levels. Five categories will bounce back from COVID impact. Three categories will be steady. The underlying trend for category growth is household penetration. As you can see in this chart, 11 of our 17 categories increased household penetration. This means more consumers are buying this category. It wasn't only consumers buying these categories, they bought our brands in unprecedented numbers. We added 8.6 million households to ARM & HAMMER, More Power To You, 2.4 million to OXICLEAN Stain Figther. And in the second half alone, VITAFUSION added 3 million more households. We know that we have category-leading repeat rates. This means once these households experience our brands, they enjoy them and come back to them, laying the foundation for strong growth in 2021. Let's look at some of the category behaviors one by one. Vitamins grew an amazing 58% in consumption. You can see the original stock-up peak in March, but also that the increased levels continued for the rest of the year. It takes 66 days to form a new habit and consumers clearly form new habits regarding taking vitamins. 20% of consumers started taking vitamins. 57%, that means more than half, are now taking vitamins daily. So, it's not only more consumers taking vitamins, they also take them more frequently. And another one-third of consumers plan more types of vitamins to their baskets, planning to add immune strengthening, for example. Last but not least, when taking vitamins, consumers prefer gummies of other forms. You can see that the share of gummies on total increased by nearly one-third. That is it is now 23% and who would be better placed to profit from that growth than the number one vitamin gummy, VITAFUSION. Let's look at the category of power flosses. Nielsen only captures about one quarter of category sales. That is why I show you unit sales across all classes of trade and you can see that after the decline at the beginning of the year with the lockdown, there was a strong rebound. In total for 2020, we achieved slightly more unit sales than in 2019 despite dentists and certain retailers being closed for significant periods of time, which also means that we came out strong by the end of the year and this momentum will continue and only accelerate with more dentist office opened up and resuming higher traffic. There's only upside. Women's grooming saw two opposing trends. On one hand, retailer stores closed or have reduced foot traffic, reducing sales. On the other hand, spa closures and COVID concerns, driving do-at-home movements and increasing sales. Our FLAWLESS team quickly spotted the trend and turned it around with spa at home products, which have just launched. We now offer solutions for women who do not want to go to a beautician and get a face massage or do not want to visit a nail salon. And as nail salons and spas have closed down due to COVID, we believe that women will continue to prefer at home treatments. So, here are two of our exciting new products; a facial massage cleanser and a salon nail toolkit. Steve will talk more about them later. Moreover, we have secured an icon to speak for the brand, Halley Berry, who will be even more popular, if that's even possible, in 2021, due to the launch of a new film Moonfall. In addition, we have Ashley Gram, Amelia Hamlin, and Duff Cameron as enthusiasts promoting FLAWLESS. It will be an exciting year for FLAWLESS. FLAWLESS means being perfectly you, be you, be flawless. Now, to our biggest category, laundry. As you can see, laundry grew 5.5% in 2020, but with a lot of swings due to consumer stockpiling and changing habits. Being more concerned about germs and being home, allowing for more time to do laundry that will continue as tailwinds for 2021. Cat litter will also benefit from changed habits that continue. It is hard to get good statistics on cat ownership, but we do know that 6% more households bought cat litter in 2020, leading me to believe that this is the minimum of additional cat owners. What this number won't capture's the households who got additional cats. And as consumers want to spend more time with their cat instead of going to stores, we have seen a significant increase in online sales, which are not captured in these Nielsen sales. Then there are categories, which are impacted by social distancing. We call these the social interaction categories. One of them is dry shampoo, where we have seen category decline due to store closures and not browsing in store. Here, the advance of vaccination and the associated expected increase of socializing will bounce back the category. An even more eagerly awaited bounce back of sales is in the condom category as condoms mean pleasure. 18 to 24-year olds can't wait to get their social lives back, and with college campuses reopening, 2021 looks promising. Now that we've gone through the different categories, let me summarize changed consumer behaviors due to COVID that we think will stay and help our business. Number one, self-care at home, fall hair care and removal hair businesses, like NAIR and FLAWLESS; cat ownership for cat litter; higher consciousness of germs and cleanliness benefiting ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, XTRA, but also KABOOM; and four, awareness trend, with a regular daily intake of supplements, VITAFUSION, L'IL CRITTERS and VIVISCAL will benefit and WATERPIK for gum health. It is not only category growth that will drive our business, it will also be the strengths of our brands and the ability to win market share, which we have proven year-over-year. We have brands consumers love. In 2020, a year with difficult supply situations, the majority of our brands, which means seven out of our 13 power brands have grown share. We are set to continue our market share winning streak. Let me get back to what I outlined at the beginning as growth drivers; brand equity and media tech business. 2020 was a year where consumers radically changed consumption, but also media behavior. This is a marketer's dream because it allows for a lot of tests and learns and very distinctive data sets. As you are familiar with data analytics, we now have great input to our media effectiveness models and are confident to drive even better ROIs in 2021. Let me just share one area. It is not only consumers who love our brands, it is influencers as well. We have more than 500 influencers globally enjoying and recommending our brands. We have reached more than 200 million consumers via those recommendations, and this number will definitely grow in 2021. What will the influencers write about? About some of our exciting new products. I hand over to Steve Cugine to share what we are launching. Enjoy.
Steve Cugine: Church & Dwight has delivered consistent new product innovation year-in and year-out in support of our global growth objectives. 2021 is no different. We have a super lineup of brand-building innovation. So much so, we do not have the time to take you through the fullness. So we have curated a few of our favorites. Every new product is born from a consumer insight. 79% of consumers want germs removed from their laundry, introducing OXICLEAN Laundry & Home Sanitizer. This product kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. It also removes germs, odors and stains. Check out this video. [Video Presentation] Consumers have been hyper-focused on cleaning household surfaces. Introducing OXICLEAN multipurpose disinfecting sprays. This product kills COVID. It is powerful, cleaning and disinfecting without chlorine bleach. Two-thirds of consumers find flossing difficult and only 16% floss daily, introducing WATERPIK Sonic-Fusion 2.0, the most successful new product launch in power flosser history just got better. It has two times the bristle speed, greater flossing power, multiple head sizes and two brush speeds. Here's another consumer insight. Consumers with smaller bathrooms struggle with counter space and outlets. Introducing Waterpik Ion, the same amazing clean, unplugged. This product is 30% smaller than traditional plug-in models, has 90 seconds of water capacity and with the lithium-ion battery that lasts up to four weeks with a single charge. Check out this video. [Video Presentation] Here's another consumer insight. Men see condoms that fit and feel the best. Introducing TROJAN all the feels, is a selection of our best condoms, with personalized fit and feel, and better feel more usage. Here is a video featuring our ECSTASY condom. [Video Presentation] One more consumer insight is that consumers are becoming more confident in doing beauty routines at home and they are aware of the cost savings. Introducing finishing touch FLAWLESS facial cleanse and salon nails. And one last consumer insight, 33% of consumer’s plan to purchase more immune support supplements, introducing VITAFUSION Super Immune Support, it is the only gummy to deliver over 100% daily value of the top 3 immune ingredients, Vitamin C, Zinc and Elderberry. It also includes a new ingredient, Manuka honey. This is the first VITAFUSION item in the cough and cold aisle. VITAFUSION has been increasing the amount of new items it has been launching. 2021 will be no different, we have an exciting list of new items coming. I'm also excited to share with you the details of another fabulous quarter and year for the international division. 2020 was like no other year, as we track the coronavirus as it surged across the globe, starting in Asia in Q1. We planned for its impact and pivoted to areas of growth as our international mix is heavily weighted toward personal care versus household products, and therefore, more susceptible to global store closures, particularly in Europe. We finished 2020 posting organic growth of 8.6%, well above our 6% evergreen goal. This is remarkable given the fact that during Q2, at the height of the pandemic, we delivered less than 1% organic growth for the division. Q4 finished up a remarkable 14.9%, behind growth in both our domestic subsidiary markets as well as our GMG business, where our surge in Asia was a key driver of performance. We have now built an international business that's over $800 million and approaching scale in key markets. And we feel that there is not a market that we cannot reach. We've also tripled the historic CAGR of the division from 3% to 9%. Wait a minute, I didn't label this slide a continued effect, it must have come from my friend, Barry Bruno. Well, this seems like a good transition point, from looking at the past performance, to Barry Bruno and his focus on the future. I will be retiring from Church & Dwight in June of this year. Barry Bruno has been promoted to Executive Vice President of the International Consumer Products division. Barry was one of my first hires when I moved into this position almost 8 years ago. He has been the co-architect of the existing international strategy. Barry has led the design and execution of the Global Markets Group and the division-wide global international marketing team. His fingerprints are all over the success of this business in conjunction with the other members of the division leadership team. Barry came to Church & Dwight from Johnson & Johnson, where he worked for 14 years across consumer, pharmaceutical and medical device businesses, where he developed a depth of experience in both U.S. domestic and global markets during his time there. He turned that experience into a great start here at Church & Dwight, and I have confidence in his ability to continue what we've started here in International. Congratulations, Barry, and good luck. In closing, it has been my sincere pleasure to work for this great company for the past 20 years. The culture at Church & Dwight is a place where performance matters, straight talk is encouraged and teamwork is a differentiator. I stayed at Church & Dwight because I felt that I could bring my unique self to work every day, table big ideas that challenges status quo. And when the decision was made, I know I had to support my peers to make it happen. This is as true today as when I joined in 1999. I am confident in the future, as the company and the International team is stronger today than ever before. Thank you. And now over to Barry.
Barry Bruno: Thanks, Steve. It's been an honor to work alongside you these last seven-plus years here in International, and I can assure you that the Cugine-effect is felt far beyond just us here in International and your work over 20-plus years has impacted the entire Church & Dwight organization. You will be missed by so many, Steve, but I think, most of all, by me. As you saw, under Steve's leadership, we've built International into an $820 million business that's growing faster than ever. And as a reminder to this audience, we think about our international business in two buckets: our subsidiaries where we have fully staffed Church & Dwight teams on the ground, in Canada, Mexico, U.K., France, Germany and Australia; and our Global Markets Group, which covers 130 other markets via distributors who represent our brands. I'm going to get into both shortly. However, this chart shows the relative size of each in net sales. As you've seen, GMG has been on a tear and now represents 34% of all international sales, followed by Canada and our European subsidiaries and then our Australia and Mexican subsidiaries. From a growth standpoint, our subsidiaries grew plus 4.8% in 2020, and GMG continued its stellar run with explosive growth of plus 19%. What's noteworthy here is that our international business is much more heavily weighted towards personal care products than our U.S. business, which makes these results even more impressive in an environment where COVID slowed down many personal care categories. For some additional context, our subsidiaries have been delivering outsized growth, more than double historical CPG category averages. And some of our key subs are now, for the first time, approaching scale, which we'll talk about as a margin improvement enabler a bit later. As mentioned earlier, GMG is now our largest entity, with outstanding growth of plus 19%. Emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America have been and will continue to be growth drivers going forward. Last but not least, you know how acquisitive we are, and I'm happy to share that we've delivered double-digit growth on WATERPIK and FLAWLESS in 2020, and they remain far underrepresented in international household penetration than in the U.S. lead market. If we look a level deeper at key drivers in our subsidiaries, we continue to make great headway in turning our U.S. domestic power brands into international power brands. ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean and TROJAN are all examples of U.S. power brands which still have long international runway in our subsidiaries. Likewise, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS household penetration in our subs trails the U.S. significantly and we're lifting and applying best practices from the U.S. to drive subsidiary success on these brands. Finally, we're approaching pricing with greater rigor and discipline and hiring dedicated resources in international to help us understand where pricing opportunities exist. From a GMG standpoint, emerging markets have been a big area of focus, and we are significantly under-indexed in these key markets versus our competitors. For context, our top CPG competitors derive over 25% of international sales from emerging markets in which we both compete, while C&D only realizes 7% of our international revenue from them. Today, we're spending more in these markets, and we'll continue to prioritize them going forward. From an acquisition standpoint, our distributor coverage in 130-plus markets gives us a great footprint for expansion and we've been making excellent headway on new acquisitions, like WATERPIK and FLAWLESS, but we're also still making excellent progress on some of our older acquisitions like BATISTE and our VMS brands. Last but not least, we're working with our supply chain partners to evolve from our export origins, where we ship products from the U.S. and the U.K., where they're made today, to more local manufacturing, particularly in Asia. Speaking of Asia, I don't think it will come as a surprise to you that the region contains some of the largest economies in the world. However, what you might find interesting is the visualization here showing that there are more consumers living in Asia than in the rest of the world combined, including 4.5 billion middle-income consumers who represent our target audience for Church & Dwight brands. In recognition of this and the terrific future growth opportunity that exists in Asia, we now have C&D representative offices in Shanghai, Singapore, and just last month, opened our first India office in Mumbai to help drive growth in that new market for us. From an acquisition standpoint, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS are our primary areas of focus. In our key subs, we've de-layered by removing distributors and are now leveraging our own sales force to sell direct. In terms of GMG, we continue to expand into new markets via distributors, with two very recent examples being our launch of WATERPIK in Japan and a FLAWLESS in India in just the past few months. Finally, we're bringing C&D's marketing, e-commerce, and pricing expertise to bear on these brands to make sure we're leveraging our capabilities, which are often broader than those of the companies from whom we acquire brands so that we can drive efficient, profitable growth all around the globe. If we dive deeper into WATERPIK as one example, we've doubled the business in the last three years, growing from $50 million when we acquired the brand to $100 million in international sales in 2020. And we're doing it by leveraging best practices and proven successes, like professional detailing, consumer marketing, and compelling in-store display activation, all borrowed from the U.S. We know this is a winning formula as we doubled the business already. However, what's even more exciting is the runway ahead of us that exists due to very low household penetration in comparison to the lead U.S. market. In terms of FLAWLESS, it's a brand we love that's still in its very early days internationally. However, you heard Britta talk about the power house influencers that we're leveraging in the U.S., and I'm happy to share that we're using them abroad as well, with plans in 10 of our largest global markets that are sure to drive awareness and trial of this great new addition to our portfolio. I mentioned earlier that we love all of our acquisitions here in international, even those that are a bit older. And an example of how we're still greenhousing some of these older brands can be seen first with BATISTE, where we've grown at a 20% CAGR over the last five years and are still under-indexed in household penetration versus our lead market in the U.K. We continue to launch in new markets and drive household penetration in existing markets and, again, have lots more room to run with household penetration less than 2% in most global markets. Finally, we can't forget about VMS. We've owned it a little bit longer, but the trends that we see in the U.S. are the same abroad. And I'm happy to share that VMS is booming for us internationally as well. One example of a market where we're investing significant time and resources on VMS is in China, where sales were up more than 30% in 2020. So again, long runways even on acquisition we've owned for a while now. Okay. So how are we doing it? Well, we're making strategic investments in areas that have the biggest impact. For example, to support our booming e-commerce business in China, we're ramping up hiring of our own e-commerce staff to help augment and better direct the efforts of our multiple partners in China. India is a vast and complicated market, and we knew we needed boots on the ground. So we've hired our first staff there just a few weeks ago. Another complicated area is global pricing, where we're now building strategies to take advantage of pricing power in order to understand where we can take price. And we now, for the first time, have dedicated international expertise there as well. From a manufacturing standpoint, we're evolving from our historical export routes, where we manufactured product in developed western markets and shipped it around the world, to local manufacturing, especially in Asia, where our business is now big enough to justify bringing co-packers online to deliver better costs and faster supply to customers. Finally, we're investing for the first time in global marketing campaigns, like ARM & HAMMER's, More Power to You campaign, where we leverage proven insights, while localizing the talent and messaging to make sure we're relevant in the markets, in which they're launched. Individually, none of these might seem all that impactful to you. However, cumulatively, I assure you, they represent a significant investment in resources and capability building that we're confident will keep international growing long into the future. Last but not least, we remain committed to doing all of the above while continuing to use our increasing scale, pricing power in key markets and our personal care weighted mix to keep increasing operating margin by 50 basis points per year. We did even better than that in 2020 where we grew 120 basis points, and we remain committed to further continuous improvements here. So in closing, we remain very excited about international and remain committed to our 6% organic growth target, which is also consistent with our outlook for 2021. And as a reminder, this is on top of almost 9% organic growth we experienced in 2020. We've got a long runway on U.S. power brands going global, a number of acquisitions with very low household penetration versus their lead markets, an enormous opportunity in emerging markets, where we've just started opening new offices to help us reach these consumers, and a number of strategic investments in resources and capabilities like e-commerce and pricing to help make sure our great international team is working as efficiently and effectively as possible to drive profitable growth long into the future. Thank you for your time and interest in our international story. Now back to you, Matt.
Matthew Farrell: Thanks, Barry. I'm going to run you through the animal productivity story right now. You heard me speak earlier about what our evergreen model is. It's 3% annual organic growth, 2% from the U.S., 6% from international and 5% from specialty products. Our Specialty Products business is a $300 million business. Two-thirds is animal productivity and one-third is specialty chemicals. If you look at the animal productivity piece, you'll see it's split between animal dairy and animal nondairy. Historically, dairy has been the biggest part of the business. The three types of products we produce are prebiotics, probiotics and nutritional supplements. Now why is that important? It's because the consumer is moving away from wanting to consume food that is produced with antibiotics. The dairy business has been cyclical. As I said before, it's been the biggest part of the business. If you look at this chart, in 2011, 2014, 2017, those were up years. So typically, it's a three-year cycle. The expectation was that 2020 was going to be a big up year. It didn't happen. Why? Because of the pandemic. So we expect a strong year from the dairy business in 2021. Now if you look at dairy versus nondairy, we were monolithic back in 2015. Less than 1% of our sales were from nondairy. In 2021, we expect it to cross 30%. So just wrapping up here, we have a trusted brand. All of those products I described are ARM & HAMMER products. We're aligned with the consumer trend to move away from antibiotics to prebiotics and probiotics. We've moved from dairy to other species, catalyst wine and poultry, and we have a lot of runway internationally. Now I'm going to talk about how we run the company. It's pretty simple. We have five operating principles: One, leverage brands; two, friend of the environment; three, leverage people; four, leverage assets; and finally, leverage acquisitions. Number one, brands consumers love. As we said – we opened the program today, pointing out that we have 13 brands that we call our power brands. These are brands that consumers love. Number two, we're a friend of the environment. And that friend of the environment started back in the 19th century. If you run your eyes across this page, you can see back in 1888, the company introduced pro environmental wall charts and trading cards that we put in our packages as a promotion for the environment. In the 1970s, we're the first corporate sponsor of Earth Day. If you went 20 years later to 1990, we were still the only corporate sponsor of Earth Day. More recently, in 2016, 50% of our global electricity demand was supplied by renewable energy sources. In 2018, we crossed 100%. Over the last five years, we've been planting trees in the Mississippi River Valley. Now why is that important? It's because trees take CO2 out of the atmosphere. And this is consistent with our goal of being carbon neutral by 2025. Here are our three environmental goals: first, water, reduce water and our wastewater by 25% by 2022; for solid waste, to increase our solid waste recycling rate to 75% by the end of 2021; and finally, air, we want to achieve 100% carbon neutral status for all of our global operations by 2025. And of all those three, that's the one I'm most excited about. Now we've been getting a lot of recognition externally, as you can see on this slide, from JUST Capital, FTSE4Good, the EPA, et cetera. Not because we've been applying for these things and running our business so we can take about, no, we've been recognized because we've been doing the right thing. Number three, we leverage people. We have the highest sales per employee of any company in the CPG space. This is an underappreciated statistic. If you look at these numbers, we're almost $1 million of sales per employee. You'd normally expect that of a start-up. We have a very simple compensation structure. We focus on 4 things: revenue, gross margin, cash from operations and EPS. And gross margin is actually an unusual element of our incentive compensation package. The reason why we have gross margin in there is because it creates financial literacy. Gross margin expansion is very important to our operating model and when people think, hey, gross margin is part of my incentive comp, they ask the question, what's gross margin? And how can I get it?  Number four, we consider ourselves asset-light. CapEx as a percentage of sales has been about 2% for as long as I've been with the company. The other thing that may not be appreciated is that about 25% of our global sales are manufactured by third parties. So I just ran through the first 4 operating principles. Lots going to number 5, leveraging acquisitions. If you do the first 4 principles well, you're going to have good shareholder returns. If you can add to that leveraging acquisitions, you get great shareholder returns which we do. We have a long history of growth through acquisitions, as I mentioned earlier. And the reason why we do so well with acquisitions is because we're disciplined. So here's the 5 criteria: number one, we only buy brands that are number 1 or number 2 in their categories. Number two, we only buy brands that can grow 3% or better and have gross margins that are equal to or better than our corporate gross margins. Number three; need to be asset-light. Number four, we're always looking for cost synergies. So we're trying to leverage our Church & Dwight supply chain footprint. And finally, these brands need to have a sustainable competitive advantage for many years to come. Our most recent acquisition is ZICAM, it's the number 1 zinc supplement in the United States in the adult cold shortening category. As many of you have been watching, the cough and cold categories have been – or expected to be down in '21. Why? Because people are wearing masks and using hand sanitizers, etcetera. We expect that as well. But we think this is going to be a wonderful acquisition for us for years to come. Just to wrap up the M&A section, we have 13 brands today. We're shooting for 20 tomorrow. Why is this important? Well, acquisitions have been a great driver of total shareholder return historically and will be again in the future. And next up is Rick to take us through the financials.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to go through 4 items today. First off, is the evergreen model like we always do? Number two is 2020 results, both for the quarter and the full year. The third thing will be the 2021 outlook. And then the fourth will be the capital allocation discussion. So first off is the evergreen model, and our shareholders know that we've been talking about this for a very long time. 3% top line, 8% bottom line. And we have a detailed model to go through as well. So 3% for net sales growth, 25 basis points for gross margin expansion; flat marketing as a percentage of sales, which is typically higher dollars as we grow the top line; and then we leverage SG&A by 25 basis points. That gets us to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and about 8% EPS growth. Now moving to 2020. So we ended the year in a fantastic way. Q4 2020 was 10.8% organic sales growth, 11% domestic organic sales growth, 14.9% for international and minus 1.2% for SPD. Gross margin was down 280 basis points, but in line with what our expectations were. Remember, our outlook was down 250 basis points for the quarter. Now that 280 included a 40 basis point drag because we recognized some of our supply chain workers as the pandemic spiked again in Q4. And then marketing change was up 140 basis points in the quarter as we invested behind our brands to enter 2021 with momentum. SG&A was leveraged by 70 basis points. Despite higher amortization and investments, the top line helped us leverage SG&A in a big way. And then EPS was $0.53. Our outlook was $0.50 to $0.52. So we beat the midpoint of the range by $0.02. Moving to the full year 2020, organic was 9.5%; domestic was 10.7%; international, 8.6%; and SPD was 0.4%. So just really a strong year to have a 10% organic full year number. Gross margin was 45.2%, or down 30 basis points, really driven because of COVID and incremental tariffs, but we'll get into the detail in a minute. Marketing was 12.1%, or higher by 30, basis points. That's very significant. It was a huge investment behind our brands. You'll hear in the outlook that we're going to return to pre pandemic levels for marketing support. Adjusted SG&A is 14.1%, or down 10 basis points. So we did leverage SG&A. And so EPS was up 15% or $2.83. And then cash was up to $990 million, a full $100 million above our $890 million estimate a year ago. And then, finally, that translates into 125% free cash flow conversion. We do a great job converting net income into cash flow. And now turning to the detail on gross margin. Here's the bridge. So for Q4, we had positive price/volume mix, similar to the way we've had it all year long, plus 130 basis points. Then inflation was a drag of 310 basis points, but that included a few items: commodities, distribution with the tight trucking market, labor increases and then investments. COVID costs were 150 basis point drag, which included a 40 basis point drag for the supplemental bonus that we discussed earlier. Incremental tariffs for WATERPIK was a 90 basis point drag for the quarter. And then productivity programs were plus 160. So just a lot of great work behind our good to great program. Acquisition, that's really ZICAM for the month of December, the positive margin mix. And then FLAWLESS accounting was down 30 basis points. Remember, back in 2019, it was a good guy. And so it didn't exist in 2020. So it's a drag year-over-year. And that's how we get to down 280 basis points for the quarter. And then all that translates into the full year to be down 30 basis points. And so we feel like we have a great springboard to have margin expansion in 2021, and we'll talk about that in a minute. Turning to this slide, this is four reasons why we can expand gross margin in the future and we believe in these things. First off is our Good to Great program. And I just got finished telling you how well we did in 2010. Number two is supply chain optimization. That's really our footprint, our network. Number three is acquisition synergies. You heard us a few months ago talk about ZICAM. And we signed up for $5 million of synergies for ZICAM, as an example. And then fourth is new products. We want to launch accretive new products. So those four reasons help us have confidence in expanding margin over the long term. Okay. Moving to the 2021 outlook. So at a high level, our outlook consists of reported sales growth of 4.5%. That's really the organic number of 3% plus the impact of ZICAM. Organic is 3%. Operating profit margin expansion of 100 basis points, which is almost double our 50 basis point expansion for our evergreen model. And then adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%. So here's a detailed outlook for 2021. First, the 4.5% reported, and then we get into 3% organic sales growth. And it's very consistent with what you just heard from Matt and Barry and Britta, 2% for domestic, 6% for international and 5% for SPD. Now the 3% organic growth, it does have a couple of strategic choices that we've made previously in there. Remember, last year, we communicated that we were gift-sizing in laundry. And we were getting out of the private label vitamin business. Both of those things, this is the second and complete year of those actions and that would have added a full point of organic growth as an example. So, we would have been at 4%. But I just wanted to give you context there. Gross margin is up 50 basis points. We'll go through that detail in a minute. And marketing is down 30 basis as we get back to kind of the average for pre-pandemic levels is around 11.8% and that's what we plan on doing in 2021. SG&A, we leveraged by 20 basis points and then we're up 100 basis points for operating margin. Now, you might ask, well, if you're leveraging operating margin by 100 basis points, why aren't you higher on the EPS growth outlook? You're only at 6% to 8%. And your evergreen model is 50 basis points and your 8% EPS growth. Well, it's because of tax. Our tax rate in 2020 was 19%, and we're going back to the consistent average of around 21%, 22%. In 2019, we had two things that helped us on tax. One was a discrete international planned settlement and then the second one was just a higher number of stock option exercises. And so those two things aren't going to recur to the same extent. And so as a result, we're up 100 basis points on operating margin. It's a really strong base business plan, up 6% to 8% on EPS and then up to approximately $1 billion of cash flow generation, cash from operations. Okay. Here's a track record of our organic sales over the last 10 years, very consistent. We've typically averaged around 4%. This year, we're calling 3% for 2021. And as I said before, if you add in some of those strategic decisions we made, we are closer to 4% on an apples-to-apples basis. We focus on gross margin in a big way. Gross margin is a great surrogate for -- and driver for EBITDA margin and then that flows all the way down to cash flow and cash generation, and we believe cash drives value. So, plus 50 basis points in 2021. The detail of the 50 basis points of expansion in 2021 really leads off with price volume mix continuing to expand. We have higher volumes. We have improved price/mix throughout the year. Inflation and the COVID costs are a drag of around 103 basis points. COVID costs do reduce year-over-year, but they still exist. And then productivity programs are a tailwind of 100 basis points. Tariffs and acquisition, that's again the Zicam acquisition and the favorable gross margin impact to mix. Those two pretty much offset, and we're at plus 50 basis points for the year. So, really happy with that type of expansion. Now, we're talking about the seasonality of gross margin, the first half, second half dynamic. So, first half gross margin is down 50 basis points. And why is that? Well, we're going back to normal promotional levels. Remember, in 2020, March, April, May, June, promotional levels pulled back in a big way as the pandemic was spiking and couponing as well. We have higher WATERPIK tariffs in the first half, right? It's not in the comp a year ago first half. And we have COVID costs compared to a year ago when there were none. And plus, there's higher commodity costs. In the second half, we have lower COVID costs. We have improved trade promotion. We have tariff remediation. We're doing actions. We're taking actions to offset that Chinese supply chain that we have for WATERPIK. And of course, we have Zicam gross margin mix favorability. Moving to marketing, we have a long track record of spending between 11% and 12% on marketing. It just drives the brand's growth over time and drives our evergreen model. In years past, the average is around 11.8% and we're saying in 2021, we're going to get back to the pre-pandemic average of around 11.8%. Moving to SG&A leverage, we have a long track record of leveraging SG&A. This is on a reported basis. In 2021, we're going to be down 20 basis points, is our expectation. But if you look at this on a cash basis on the next slide, you can see how much we're actually leveraging cash SG&A, we're going to be down 60 basis points in 2021. And then finally, on EPS, we have a long track record of great EPS growth, low double digit, high single-digit EPS growth for a long period of time. And in 2021, it's no different, 6% to 8% EPS growth. That's $3 to $3.06 is the outlook. And that's on top of 15% growth in 2020. The same discussion we just had in gross margin, we have timing dynamic for EPS growth as well, for mainly the same reasons. EPS growth is expected to be down 5% in the first half as we get back to normal promotional levels. We have higher WATERPIK tariffs. And we have higher COVID costs as well as higher commodity costs. In the second half, we expect to be up around 20% and that's because of a return to historical marketing levels, improved promotional efficiency, lower COVID costs, tariff remediation and those actions that we're taking and 2020 investments that aren't going to repeat in the back half of the year. Okay. Moving to free cash flow, this is my favorite slide. We have a long track record of free cash flow conversion, 122% over the time period. We had 125% in 2020. How do we do that? Well, we have great working capital management. We've moved from 52 days down to 16 days is the outlook for 2021. And if you strip out the Chinese supply chains that we have for WATERPIK and FLAWLESS, those numbers are actually closer to five days as we approach zero working capital. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have a lot of financial capacity. We expect to end the year at 1.3 times debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2021. And so we have a lot of dry powder, what do we do? We have the ability to do up to a $4.2 billion deal and still maintain our credit rating. So just a lot of excess cash and debt capacity. Now, moving to capital allocation. We're very clear on the top five reasons for capital allocation. Number one, far and away is TSR-accretive M&A. And we're very picky on what deals we do. Number two, we moved this up previously this summer on CapEx for organic growth. And you're going to hear me talk about capacity additions for laundry, litter and vitamins in a few minutes. So number two, is capacity investments for growth. Number three, MPD. Launching an accretive MPD has been just a stalwart of this company, and it helps drive our top line as well. Number four is debt reduction. And as you saw, we're going to end the year at 1.3 times debt-to-EBITDA in 2021 is our expectation. And then return cash to shareholders through dividends and buyback. We're not a capital-intensive company. If you look back at our history, we usually bump around 2% of sales or below. In the years past, we've had capacity additions, and that's what happened in 2009. We added our York laundry plant, and that's when we bumped up to about 5.5%. In 2011, we bumped up to 2.8% when we added our Victorville laundry plant. And so 2021 and 2022 are no different. We think we're going to spike up to around 3.5% as we add these capacity investments. And so those capacity investments are around laundry, litter, vitamins, baking soda, technology in our distribution network around the country. And then finally, we have a great history of paying dividends. For over 120 years, we've been paying dividends. And in 2021, our outlook is a 5.2% dividend increase on top of increases of 5.5%, 4.5% and 14.5% these past few years. In addition, we did a $300 million ASR that started in December and we expect to complete by the end of Q1. And this ends the formal presentation, and now we'll turn it over to Q&A for Matt, myself and the rest of the leadership team.
A - Matthew Farrell: Okay. Morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We have all the EVPs on the line with us. Many questions were submitted during the rolling of the tape. So Rick is going to read the questions, and we'll take them one by one.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Thanks, Matt. First question is from Olivia. Is the new OxiClean sanitizer product getting incremental shelf space? What do you think about the opportunity in FLAWLESS and which brands got more shelf space in 2020?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. All right. Hey, that's a great question. We've got a lot of confidence in 2021. I'm going to dish that to Paul Wood, who is our EVP of Sales.
Paul Wood: Appreciate it. Thanks, Olivia, for the question. Yes. Let me start with Oxy sanitizer, right? I think, as Steve mentioned, the right product, right time, right place and definitely lends itself to the incrementality question that you're asking. So one of the strongest launches will have on the acceptance front, and so feel very good there. In terms of the other categories, great question, too, because while the headlines are supply and demand, some incredible work by the sales and the commercial team in other categories to strengthen the foundation and some great wins from shelving and placement and brand positioning on condoms, vitamins, BATISTE, laundry and laundry additives throughout the year as well. So we've been busy at work to strengthen the foundation and really excited about some of the things that have already hit market and some yet to come. So it's been a strong year on those elements, Olivia.
Rick Dierker: Okay. The next question comes from Rupesh on gummy vitamin. What have you seen lately on the competitive front? And also from the supply chain, have you now fully caught up with demand?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Yes. Well, gummies has been a big winner for us in 2020. if you look at the – both the category and our performance in the fourth quarter, the category was up 50% and our brands were up about 56%. In fact, if you roll forward into January, you see that we're – our consumption is up still in the 40s. So very strong performance. Both of our brands gained share in Q4, both VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS. And keep in mind that we've been capacity-constrained during that time. I can imagine if we were not. With respect to capacity, you probably heard us talk on the last call that we have a new third-party that came online in the fourth quarter. And our view long term is that we will have both internal capacity expanding as well as treat this third-party as a long-term partner. So it's not an episodic relationship. Anything to add to that, Rick?
Rick Dierker: No. It's a good summary. Next question is from Joe Altobello. Well, Steve, because you need to be moving to Naples to hang out with Lou Tursi. Congrats, Steve.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Well, we have Steve on the line this morning, I want to caution Steve, that I suspect Lou Tursi is also listening in. So take it away, Steve.
Steven Cugine: Yes. Well, certainly, I would say that – I don't have any specific plans to move to Naples in the short term, but I'm sitting here in the Northeast and it's pretty cold. So I'm longing for some warmer weather. So you never know. But no plans as of this moment. And – but when I do get to Naples, I'd certainly hang out with Lou for at least a cocktail or dinner. Thanks.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Thank you, Joe Altobello, for keeping it light today. All right. What's the next question, Rick?
Rick Dierker: Here's a question from Bill Chappel. Is there a target for percent of sales from international over the next five years?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Well, you know our evergreen target is 3% for the company, 2% for the U.S., 6% international and 5% for specialty products. So you're probably asking, Bill, because we've exceeded the 6% year after year for many years, but we're very confident that 6% or better is intact for years to come. And anything to add to that, Barry?
Barry Bruno: No. Matt, I'd just say we aspire certainly to beat that 6% target. But no, there's not a specific percentage of sales that we are shooting for right now.
Matthew Farrell: Okay.
Rick Dierker: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Bill, is probably -- hey, 17% of sales is international today, and we have a good problem, right? Our domestic business continues to grow very strong. And so that percent of sales, plus a lot of the M& A we've done has been more U.S. focused. So over time, even though we've had great growth internationally, the percentages stayed relatively stable. Next question is from Andrea. It's really about what's the backdrop for commodities and inflation and transportation for Church & Dwight in the outlook? So I'll take that one. In general, we expect commodities to be up next year. It's really first half, second half story. If we look at some of the big drivers, even in the quarter, HDPE and polypro were up close to 20% and ethylene was up 5% in the quarter. In the first half of the year, we expect those commodities to be up around 20% to 30%. But in the back half, it's pretty flat because we're experiencing that as early as Q3 of 2020. As for the transportation market, we do expect it to be at mid-single digits, but I'll flip this to Rick Spann to add any other color commentary.
Rick Spann: Yes. And thanks, Rick. Yes, the transportation market is very tight. Spot market rates have increased by more than 30%. In fact, this is the second highest market – the second tightest market that we've seen in the last 8 years. And of course, that's having an impact on our transportation cost. And just a bit more color on commodities. Commodities were pretty flat on the first half of last year. But as Rick mentioned, we see headwinds on our major commodities right now. But not only on our major commodities, but some of the smaller purchases of raw and packing materials that we use across the rest of our business. Fortunately, we have a robust productivity program to offset some of these headwinds.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Next question is from Steve Powers. Is there a specific data that gives you confidence in vitamin usage as a sustainable trend as opposed to something that is correlated with elevated health awareness due to COVID and more time spent at home?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. It's good question, Steve. I'll just say a few words and then I'll dish it to Britta. But you heard in Britta's remarks, the longer a new behavior lasts, the more likely that it's going to continue. And that is our expectation for next year. We think the wellness trend is certainly in our favor. And we don't think that people are going to fall back to their old ways. Britt, anything to add to that?
Britta Bomhard: Yes. We do have specific data. So we know that 20% more households bought vitamins. And we also know that 57% of people are using it now daily. So we know that those behaviors have changed and there's more households. We also know that the households currently are buying more than they used to.
Matthew Farrell: Right. And of course, the trend from pills to capsules, we expect that's going to continue, not just in '21, but in future years.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Next question is from Lauren Lieberman. 3-part question; first one on the outlook for inflation. To what degree are hedges helping in 2021? And any contracts for logistics? I'll go ahead and jump in and answer that one. In general, we're about 65% hedged for 2021. So pretty well protected overall for incremental commodity volatility. And then, number two, contracts for logistics. Remember, part of our part of our freight is picked up by customers and some of it is also on dedicated lanes. And so, really about a-third of it is subject to more extreme volatility and we have to use brokerage and whatnot for that. So we are well protected there as well. Second question from Lauren is -- the next two are on FLAWLESS. To what degree are new products expect to drive FLAWLESS growth this year?
Matthew Farrell: Yes.
Rick Dierker: And maybe it's a -- part and parcel is her second one. FLAWLESS is historically a hair removal brand. What are you seeing that gives you confidence in the brand expanding into other areas like skincare or facial cleansers?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. No, it's a good question. Yes, we bought the FLAWLESS brand in 2018. It was largely a face and brow product and, frankly, a little known brand. And over the past couple of years, we've been working on, not only brand awareness, but also to build out the brand. So we'd reach far more consumers with other products. And that's the reason why we've introduced this year the mani-pedi product, the body cleanser and also the face cleanser. So we think with respect to 2021, we think FLAWLESS will be up well in excess of 20% from a sales perspective. And the three reasons for that, one, would be the new products, which we talked about during the presentation. Also, the influencers that we've also had to join the brand this year. And finally, the at-home grooming trend, we think, is still an opportunity for us.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Great. Kevin Grundy is up next. He has a few part question. First is, some housekeeping, some questions on investors, mine would be modest lower 6% to 8% EPS growth outlook for 2021 versus the comment on the third quarter call that you'd deliver against 8% evergreen outlook in 2021. You mentioned the tax rate being higher, but that presumably would have been anticipated a few months ago. Please comment on a more conservative outlook. And let's pause and answer that question first.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Okay. That's a good question, Kevin. So we -- look, we feel really good about 2021. We have a lot of confidence with respect to the categories, because we think we have been really thoughtful about them, as well as the logic with respect to which ones are going to go up and are going to go down. As you know, as Rick described, there's -- our expectation is 3% top line, but the math is more like a 4% top line, because we have a 1% drag from the second year effects of exiting private label vitamins and also we're exiting XTRA in Canada. As far as the EPS goes, yes, we're coming off of a little higher base than we thought we were going to be at when we were in October, so we had a range of 50 to 52, we came in at 53. So we're $0.02 better than our midpoint. So we did leave ourselves some room with a range of 6% had 8%. As you know, we’ve had 8% or better for many, many years. So we don't expect to -- for it to end that streak in 2021. As far as the year goes, there's obviously pluses and minuses. There's probably more pluses than minuses than when you look at the 2021. We have a potential for lower COVID costs, could get some help from currency, as well as promotional levels staying down a little bit longer. Anything to add to that, Rick?
Rick Dierker: Yes. The only thing I'd add is, maybe when you look at the two-year stack, just how strong the EPS growth really is, 15% in 2020 and then 6% to 8%. So, 21% to 23% EPS growth. If you look at that versus the peers, peers are closer to 7% or 8% on a stack basis. So, just feel really good about the strength on top of strength. Okay. The second question that came ahead was really international-related. There's still the areas of biggest areas of opportunity. He imagines that executed in China is certainly one of those and emerging markets. And then comment on margin improvement, firstly, and then where you see in investing for larger, faster growth.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. I'm pretty confident that Barry Bruno is very eager to take a swing at that question with respect to prospects for growth in international. So Barry, jump in.
Barry Bruno: Yes, happy to give it a shot. So, yes, clearly, emerging markets are the biggest opportunity, right? There's increasing household income. Our brands are new in a lot of these markets, specifically China, North Asia, Southeast Asia, all very exciting to us. We just opened an office in India as well to help us start to get a toehold in that important market. And our business in Latin America, even amid a lot of economic turmoil, is really, really booming. So, definitely, emerging markets are a disproportionate area of focus. In terms of margin improvement, we're working on understanding pricing opportunities better. We've got dedicated resources now looking at pricing around the globe. We're working on improving COGS by local manufacturing as opposed to exporting product. And we've got a host of other areas of improvement that will allow us to keep delivering at least that 50 bps annually that we've committed to.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Thanks, Barry. Next up.
Rick Dierker: The next question is from Chris from Wells Fargo. I thought your comments around returning promotions in the first half 2021 back to pre-COVID levels were interesting. That's a bit more intentional than what we've heard from some of your peers. What wiggle room do you have there, i.e., do you wait and see how things play out with competitors, or do you lead on returning promotional levels? Longer term, what do you think about commercial needs in your categories?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Let's -- when we talk about sold on deal, we're essentially talking about household categories. So, if you look -- it's laundry and litter. So, the trend year-over-year for laundry sold on deals, like if you looked at Q2, Q3, and Q4, sold on deal for the category was down 1,700 basis points in Q2 and in Q3 and Q4 was down 800 and then 750. So, it's still muted and, frankly, low -- pretty low. In our fourth quarter, you may recall, we said we were going to spend behind some new products, and that would be clean and simple and ABSORBx. But that's largely behind us now as we go into the New Year. Q2 year-over-year will absolutely be higher simply because it was so low in Q1 of 2020. So, everybody pulled their promotion. So, there will be a year-over-year increase for about everybody in Q2. So, it will be up in Q2 because Q2 2020 was the low water mark. Anything to add to that, Rick?
Rick Dierker: And I think the commentary is true. We have in Q3, Q4 of 2020, it was largely behind new products, and we're past that. And then in Q1, Q2 of next year, we're not saying it's going to be maybe at pre-pandemic levels, that normality, which is going to be above the very, very depressed level that it was in 2020.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. One thing I didn't point out was that I talked about laundry, but if you look at litter, so litter, the trend was, if you went in Q2, Q3, Q4, litter was down 800 basis points sold on deal in Q2 and Q3, Q4 down to 70. So the category was a little bit more heated up in Q4, but still down almost 300 basis points year-over-year.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Next question is from Steve Powers [ph]. A lot of investment spending in 2020 clearly. Can you drill down and talk about where that investment spending has been prioritized, whether in terms of specific brands or capabilities or channel development and whether or not that prioritization changes and at all in 2021?
Matthew Farrell: Yeah. We wouldn't get into specific brands, but we did -- we have talked about where we spent the money. We spent things on automation of non-plant processes as well as in the factories, new product tests and learns. We had some projects in IT and R&D analytics projects, some consumer research we wanted to get after. So there's pretty broad investment in the second half.
Rick Dierker: Yeah. And some of that was really transitory, right? We always have investments, but we were just doing so well in 2020 that we fast forwarded it and made incremental investment. And that's some of the things that I just talked about.
Matthew Farrell: But the fair amount of those investments were largely nonrecurring.
Rick Dierker: Bill Chappell [ph] had a similar question on trade promotion. Why do you expect trade promotion to normalize in 2021? It appears that some of your major competitors are comfortable with lower levels remaining. And did you see a meaningful pickup in competitive activity in Q4?
Matthew Farrell: I think we already handled that question with respect to the trend for Q2, Q3 and Q4. Now I would say we expect it to continue to be muted. Just in Q2, we do think it's going to be -- year-over-year, you're going to see a pop, but we're certainly comfortable with lower promotional levels in 2021.
Rick Dierker: Okay. And then Steve Powers [ph], the new disinfecting products you're rolling out on Oxi seem different. Given that the demand for disinfectant solutions right now seems global, do you see any potential to use those innovations as a way to push the Oxi brand further outside the U.S. market, or is it too early to have that discussion?
Matthew Farrell: Yeah. I'll just say a couple of words. Steve and Barry have had some success moving the Oxi brand outside of the U.S. over the past couple of years. And we've had great success in a couple of markets. I'll let Barry take a swing at where we see some opportunity.
Barry Bruno: Yeah. We've had great success with the brand outside of the U.S. Japan, in particular, has been a real star for us, and we're continuing to invest there. We do have other market launches planned for next year, but I'm not going to get into them specifically, so we don't tip off any competition. But yeah, there are other markets that launch into next year. The brand is strong and definitely relevant internationally.
Matthew Farrell: Thanks, Barry.
Rick Dierker: Next one is from Kaumil [ph]. Any changes in the pressure from retailers as they regroup after a year of demand spikes, and things through managing the incremental cost of expanding into the omni-channel?
Matthew Farrell: Yeah. I think that's a perennial question that we get is because every year, the concern is that retailers are asking for more and more from the suppliers. We often say that because our power brands are number one or two in their categories, we're in a much better position to have those conversations with the retailers than if we're in either a three, four, five, or six brand. But Paul, if you have anything to add to that, just go ahead and jump in.
Paul Wood: Yeah, I think the only thing I’d add onto that would be the retailers are under tremendous pressures, right? A lot of them were going down an e-commerce journey, some further along on that than others, but they all having to play catch-up and, whether they're using third parties like Instacart and ship, it certainly pulled their labor in other places, and it's more expensive for them. At the same time, reaching the consumer through digital means and loyalty card programs, while it's effective, has added costs as well. So there's no question that retailers are under tremendous profitable pressures as they try and get back to normal as well. So those are all challenges, perennial question and perennial answer, probably just heightened a little bit more because the e-commerce and the shifts that we're going through as we speak.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Okay. Next question is from Jon Andersen. With all the new consumer trial your brands experienced in 2020, what are you doing to try and retain those customers as we move toward a post pandemic environment?
Matthew Farrell: And is that brand-specific, that question?
Rick Dierker: So it's likely about all the household penetration we had and all the new consumers that we gain in the different brands. How do we retain those consumers over the long term?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Well, you heard Britta talked about the household penetration that we had in ARM & HAMMER, but I think the household penetration has been even broader than that. I think we have a very robust marketing program, both online, which is now approaching two-thirds of our spend. But I'll let Britt take a swing about why we're going to hang on to those new consumers.
Britta Bomhard: Yes. So I would cite two very distinct facts. So the first one is, you have trial and repeat. And all our brands, our repeat rates are very strong, which today indicate that consumers are happy with the product performance. So that gives us confidence. In some areas like BATISTE, we have, by far, the best repeated loyalty rates. So that's number one, just based on product performances. The second one is we also have a lot of programs where we invite people to join our communities or our e-mail lists or other areas of staying connected and we are actually using that to reach out again and make sure that they feel that brand loves continuing in 2021.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Thanks, Britta. That's a good add.
Rick Dierker: Next question is from Steve Bowers. Do you have data on the longevity of WATERPIK use following dental recommendations? The correlation with dental office openings makes good sense, but I'm wondering about the stickiness of device use as distance in time from that initial visit and recommendation increase.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I don't know if we have that – the statistic that you're asking for, Steve. But Britta, I don't – could you weigh in? Do we know if we have those kind of stat?
Britta Bomhard: So we don't have necessarily the statistics and such. But what we do have, and I think that's a very, very interesting data, is when people buy a WATERPIK, they can register with us. So let's assume these are the more serious users who are registering. And we've seen those rates increased more than fourfold in 2021. We also know that for some of our products where we have repeat purchases, be it Sonic Fusion, where we have the dental brushes, or for some of the others to tip, we can clearly see that those repeat rates are increasing.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Thanks, Britta. Next question from Lauren Lieberman. Market shares are up in only about 50% of your categories. What do you see as the idea would be?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. It's a good question. Historically, what we shoot for is two-thirds. So we think it's a great day. Now we have Zicam, but we had 12 power brands. We'd be shooting for eight out of 12 to be – to gain share or hold or gain share in their categories. In some of our categories, some of the brands that lost share somewhat related to our – we're out of stocks during the year. So that did hurt a few of our brands. But all in, we feel really good about where our brands stand with consumers going into 2021. Britta, anything you want to add to that?
Britta Bomhard: No, I think the only one I can add is, and we do brand equity measurement, so we know that we strengthened brand equities for our significant – for some of-- for the ones we measure. So a very clear indication of consumer being vetted to our brands and loving our brands.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. And you saw we spent a fair amount of marketing in the second half to help drive that brand equity.
Britta Bomhard: I know you were going to throw back at us. So that was very productive spend. As we talked about, the users, the households we won and lots of the programs we ran were exactly tapping into the current situation and emotion. So some of you might have seen, we did have some, but we people in COVID times are looking for brands to step up and do more than just sell products. We have the VITAFUSION so we had on each of our brands significant emotional connections with consumers.
Rick Dierker: Okay. A couple of questions from Bill Chappell. What is the cadence of CapEx spend this year? Have you already started on the expansion project? I'll take that one. Cadence is very consistent with what many years of spend. It's typically back-end loaded, Bill. And have you started on expansion projects? There's a whole list of capacity projects. We mentioned just laundry, litter vitamins, distribution, warehousing and technology stuff. So it's a mixed bag. Some have already started. Some are underway. And some are to be starting. Second question from Bill, can you talk more about tariff remediation for the second half? Can you quantify the impact? Well, we've been very vocal about the impact of tariffs on WATERPIK. And with enough lead time, we always believe that we can do things to impact the supply chain. And that's what we did over the last 6 to 12 months. And in 2021, in the back half, we're going to start to see a benefit of a few million dollars and the full year run rate of that is, is even better. So we're just really happy with that team and the progress we've made there. Next question is Joe Altobello. Which categories are you most concerned about in 2021 with respect to pantry loading or consumption declines?
Matthew Farrell: Well, I'll let Britta comment on the categories because we did bucket all 4 of them. So as far as the ones we might be most concerned with – Joe, we -- the way we bucketed them, we did say which ones we plan on staying elevated, which ones we think are going to fall back. The ones we said we're going to fall back are categories like, like baking soda, for example. The declines were going to be baking soda, toothache, carpet and pregnancy kits. So pretty confident they're going to fall back. The question is, how far would they fully fall back? And then far as the ones that are going to recover would be condoms and dry shampoo. That's more of a back half view as more and more people get vaccinated and consumer mobility expands. But anything to add to that, Britta?
Britta Bomhard: No, I think you captured it. I think the ones we are concerned is where we – where there's COVID uncertainty, right, which has to do with whether the vaccines and whether that will bring people back. But for the majority of our categories, let's remember, they are continuous household consumption categories. So people are washing their clothes, cleaning their houses, having their cats and as I mentioned, having more cats. So for the big majority, we know that we actually have stronger performance.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Next question from Kevin Grundy. You kind of build on that, on market share, specifically, only seven of 13 power brands gained this year in 2020 and it was a bit unique in 2020. This is due to our confidence to improve market share momentum in 2021.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Well, normally, we kind of pick on the ones that didn't grow, I should say, it's seven out of 13. One of the five that didn't grow is because we're using Nielsen data. And so WATERPIK would be one that you would say, well, we lost some share in 2020. Yes, that's a business we expect to grow mid to high single digits in 2021. XTRA lost some share in 2020? No. Why is that? Well, it's because both XTRA, Sun and Purex, all the deep value brands lost share in 2020. And the benefit, obviously, went to the mid-tier and the higher premium brands. If you look at ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent in the fourth quarter, we had an all-time high, 14% market share. So there are reasons why some of those brands declined or -- and with respect to Nielsen data, lost share in 2020. But we do expect -- we're targeting two-third of our 13 power brands will gain share in 2021. Anything to add to that, Britta?
Britta Bomhard: No, I think you said it really well. And we've seen a couple of our brands, particularly in the last quarter or last month, actually regaining market share, which we see as the positive momentum you've mentioned.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. You’re up.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Rupesh had a couple of questions. One was on online penetration. Do you expect to see further increases in online penetration this year, or could it level off or step back? And how are you thinking about the stickiness of 2020 gains?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, hey, it's a good question. Online, for us, the history, Rupesh, so in 2015 was 1%. 2019 was 8% and 2020 was 13%. In fact, the fourth quarter, we were at 14%. Our expectation is that for 2021, that 15% of our global sales will be online. So we'll go from 13% this current year to 15% next year. So we do think that's going to remain sticky, as you say. And, you know what, if you think about some of the categories that did expand online, to be like vitamins, WATERPIK, litter, those were the big growers. But we do think it's going to stick and we think it's going to continue to expand. We think a lot of people that discovered ordering online, like we said with vitamins, is a new habit. So we don't see a fall back in 2021.
Rick Dierker: And then the second question is more about modeling. Just remind us about what do you have baked in for FX? And remind us how to think about ZICAM seasonality. I'll take the FX question. If rates stay where they're at, that will be, as Matt mentioned before, maybe one of the tailwinds that we have in 2012. And then, Matt, do you want do ZICAM?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. As far as ZICAM goes, 2021 is really dependent upon the end of the year flu season. Historically, the ZICAM business has 50% of its net sales in the fourth quarter. So that's all ahead of us, Rupesh.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Next question is from Mark. Please tell us -- please talk about why specialty product still makes sense as part of Church & Dwight, because it has underperformed longer-term expectations in these recent years. How much time does management spend on that segment? And under what circumstances would you consider it non-core?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Well, specialty products has historically been a cyclical business. You saw in our presentation that 2014 was an up year, 2017 was an up year and the next up year would have been 2020 if not for the pandemic. So, we think that 2021 is going to be a good year for specialty products. We have been trying to flatten that business out over time by moving into other species. It is an asset-light business. The products are branded ARM & HAMMER. And if you think about the business, one-third of the business is bulk sodium bicarbonate, which is labeled ARM & HAMMER, which is our legacy business and, frankly, is the soul of the company. The -- as far as the metrics that, that business throws off; it throws off plenty of cash in relation to the assets that we own. So, we do think this is a business we're going to own long-term. It is -- as you point out, it is a small part of the company. It's only 6% of our revenues, but it doesn't require a disproportionate amount of management's time.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Next question is from Bill. He just wanted to say best of luck to Steve, enjoyed working with you. And a modeling question, what is the underlying share count for 2021 implied in your outlook? And that is 252 million, Bill. Next question from John [Indiscernible]. On international, in 2020, the lower markets growth far outpace that is the sub-market. Do you expect that trend to continue? And what are the key drivers of the outsized GMG growth?
Matthew Farrell: Well, one thing to keep in mind is that if you look at the percentage of our sales of Church & Dwight sales, that's international, comparison to peers, it's very low. When I joined the company, the international was 17% of our global sales. It's still 17% of our global sales today in spite of the phenomenal growth internationally. I'll have Barry give you a couple of stats, contrasting Church & Dwight with our peers and why we think we have such a great runway going forward.
Barry Bruno: Yes, absolutely. Thanks Matt. So, a couple of thoughts. Most of our peers have over 50% of their sales generated from international, while Church & Dwight has just 17%. So, you can see the runway there. To drill down another level deeper, in terms of emerging markets, we only get about 7% of our sales there, while the average CPG company gets about 27% of their sales from emerging markets. So, definitely a runway there. Why do we have confidence in it continuing? We're opening offices closest to where the consumers are, right? So, now we have offices in Singapore, Shanghai and Mumbai, in Panama. That's a lot more resources on the ground that are going to keep GMG growing at an accelerated rate in the future. On the subs, I want to complement them as well. So, you saw they've been growing at a 5%, 6%. Pretty significant for western developed market. So, they're doing pretty well as well. The combination of the two gets us to that evergreen target and hopefully even above that.
Matthew Farrell: Thanks, Barry.
Rick Dierker: Okay. We have two questions left. Next question is from Kevin Grundy on unit dose. Years ago, we always talked about getting your fair share in the category. How are share gains in pods have been hard to come by for ARM & HAMMER and P&G still is the leader with 80% share. Please provide some updated thoughts on your outlook for unit dose.
Matthew Farrell: It's a good question. It is a relevant question, too, Kevin. We did lose share, and we lost 40 basis points of share in the second half. You may have heard us say on previous calls that we did have some internal issues with respect to supply. Rick has described the fact that we've been building capacity and bringing it in-house. So we expect to turn that around. But long term, we need to -- we -- our ambition is to get our fair share, and that means we would have over a double-digit percentage share of the unit dosing. And today, it's less than 4%.
Rick Dierker: Okay. And then the final question is from John Andersen [ph] on e-commerce. Now that it's 14% of sales, what's your market share position and profit margin online versus off-line? And then are you seeing more growth through buy online, pick up curb side or pure-play e-commerce like Amazon? I'll take the first one. Our market shares in general are at or above our bricks and mortar. There's no great measuring stick to use to do that. But our growth is at/or above category averages online. Our profit margin online, we've been very clear about that, in general it's at parity to brick and mortar, but part of that is because we have personal care still growing faster than our household business in general online. And so that's a margin tailwind. As our household business grows faster, we will need to get into more solutions for delivery, et cetera. So the second question maybe is a good one for Paul. Are you seeing more growth through buy online and pick up curbside or the pure plays like Amazon?
Paul Wood: Yeah, it's a great question. And the frustration I think we all have is very limited data is what's being shared out maybe from the retailers and some of these third parties as they're just trying to catch up. So I think we're all triangulating on that, but yet, by and large, we're seeing a ton of buy online, pick up in store, but that's also blending with same-day delivery expectations, so that last mile piece. It's almost dividing that world into send it in the mail or what's considered old, two to five days. So seeing a heavy propensity towards that buy online pickup today, but also, like I said, that today delivery, tomorrow expectation. Certainly watching it, the pure plays are certainly blending into brick-and-mortar and the brick-and-mortar, don't have to repeat it, we all know what's going on there. But to say that it's an active conversation and very fluid with a lot of different ways of work in and expectations by the customer, different -- how your product shows up online, you can imagine and all the analytics that go along with it moving very quickly. So I'm excited about the opportunities ahead, regardless whether it's the traditional brick or the pure plays. I think there's a lot of good momentum for us, particularly Church & Dwight.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. That was the last question. Just to wrap up. Everybody knows there's a lot of uncertainty in 2021. I don't have to enumerate those for you today. So consequently, we went -- we were pretty painstaking with respect to our press release and the information that we shared today, category-by-category. So we've taken a hard look at it. We feel real good about 2021, both top line and bottom line. And as I said before, we expect to continue our streak of 8%, but we did leave ourselves a little bit of room when we said 6% to 8%. And we're looking forward to seeing -- well, we won't see you, but we'll talk to some of you again at late February at CAGNY. And if not, we'll talk to everybody again in April. So thanks for joining today.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that, on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q3 results, and I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. The pandemic has given us an opportunity to display our agility as a company. We increased our communications with retailers. We changed our marketing messages. We shifted investments to categories that are most important to consumers. And we set new production records for VITAFUSION, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER baking soda. And we've moved people to focus on the online class of trade. So we've been proactive in seizing the opportunities presented by the crisis and are increasing manufacturing capacity in our plants and externally with new co-packers. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work. Their efforts are paying off. The agility and resilience of the Church & Dwight team is showing up in our results. Our priorities continue to be employee safety, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands. Our plant warehouse and laboratory employees have done an exceptional job keeping safe, which has contributed to our ability to operate our supply chain. Our office employees continue to work remotely and are doing a super job running the company. So now let's talk about the results. Q3 was another exceptional quarter. Reported sales growth was 13. 9% and adjusted EPS was $0.70. Revenue, earnings and operating cash flow were all significantly higher in Q3 than last year, driven by the significant increase in demand for many of our products. Organic sales grew 9. 9%, driven by higher consumption. Regarding e-commerce, we were already strong pre COVID and well positioned online. In Q3, our online sales increased by 77% as all retailer.coms have grown. One example would be gummy vitamins. In 2019, 8% of our full year sales were online. This year, we expect full year to be about 14% online. Recall, we began the year targeting 9% online sales as a percentage of global consumer sales. In Q1, it was 10% online, Q2 13% and Q3 also 13%. So we expect the full year to be actually close to 13% as well. We continue to conduct research on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers. There is no surprises here, actually. There is continued consumer concern that stores will run out of stock and websites will face delivery issues. Consumers report that they are consolidating shopping trips and continue to stockpile to ensure that they have enough product for a couple of weeks at a time. If we look at year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns, our brands remain generally in balance in the 15 categories in which we compete. With respect to our brands, we had broad based consumption growth in Q3. We saw a double-digit consumption growth in VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, OXICLEAN, FLAWLESS, ORAJEL, NAIR, First Response pregnancy kits and cleaners. In Household, our laundry business consumption was up 4% and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was up 8%. Water flossers is another bright spot, as consumption turned slightly positive in Q3. Although our lunch and learn activity continues to be significantly curtailed, we intend to continue to address this with incremental advertising. In addition to VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS, water flossers is another brand we expect to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. BATISTE dry shampoo remains impacted by social distancing, with consumption down 10%, but improved sequentially compared to Q2 when consumption was down 22%. TROJAN consumption was down 6% Q3, but also improved sequentially when we were down 15% in Q2. There's no doubt that consumers have made health and wellness of priority. VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw the greatest consumption growth of any of our categories in Q3, up 49%. The category consumption was even higher. Our expectation is that consumer demand for gummy vitamins will remain high. And we have new third-party capacity coming online in late Q4 to take advantage of this trend. Consumers are focusing on health and wellness, but also cleaning, home cooking and new grooming routines. At a recent investor conference, you may have heard me cite consumer research that suggests it takes 66 days to form a new habit. And only time will tell, if all of these new behaviors will translate into permanently higher levels of consumption. But if they do endure over time, we believe we are well positioned. Now a few words about private label. As you know, our exposure to private label is limited to five categories. Private label shares have remained generally unchanged for the first, second and third quarters of this year. And now international. Our international business came through with double-digit organic growth in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our GMG business. That's our Global Markets Group and Canada. In October, our GMG business is off to another strong start, and we continue to see strong POS recovery in Canada and Europe. After three consecutive quarters of growth, our Specialty Products business contracted 3.4% in Q3, primarily due to the poultry segment. Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers even in this economy. In 2020, we've launched many new products, which are described in our press release. VITAFUSION gummy vitamins launched a number of new products. And to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity, we launched POWER ZINC and Elderberry Gummies. We've launched ARM & HAMMER Clean & Simple, which has only six ingredients plus water, compared to 15 to 30 ingredients for typical liquid detergents. And in the second half, we launched ARM & HAMMER AbsorbX clumping cat litter, a new litter, which is 55% lighter than our regular litter. Now let's turn to the outlook. We're having an exceptional year. We now expect full year adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 14%, which is far above our evergreen target of 8% annual EPS growth. Given our strong performance, we have raised our full year outlook for sales growth to be approximately 11% and organic sales growth to be approximately 9%. As mentioned many times in the past, we take the long view in managing Church & Dwight, in order to sustain our evergreen model. In the second half, we took the opportunity to increase our marketing spend behind our new products and we made incremental investments in the company. As we wind up the year, we are putting together our 2021 plan. It's safe to say that we have a high degree of confidence that we will meet our evergreen model in 2021. In February, we'll provide our detailed outlook for next year. Now in conclusion, I would like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. The great thing about our company is we are positioned to do well in both good and bad economic times. The categories in which we play are largely essential to consumers. And we have a few categories that stand to benefit from the current environment. We have a balance of value and premium products. Our power brands are number one or number two in our categories. And we have low exposure to private label. We're coming off some of the best growth quarters we've ever had. And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses. We believe our company is stronger and more agile than ever. And finally, we have the resources, the common sense and the ambition to ensure that our brands perform well in the future. Next up is Rick to give you details on the third quarter.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes an acquisition-related earnout adjustment, grew 6.1% to $0.70 compared to $0.66 in 2019. As we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earnout period. Stronger-than-expected sales performance allowed the company to spend incrementally on marketing. Reported revenue was up 13.9%, reflecting a continued increase in consumer demand for our products. Organic sales was up 9.9%, driven by a volume increase of 10.2%, partially offset by 0.3% of unfavorable product mix and pricing, primarily driven by new product support. Volume growth was driven by higher consumption. Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic, organic sales increased by 10.7%, largely due to higher volume. Overall, growth was led by VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and OXICLEAN stain fighters. We commonly get asked to bridge the Nielsen reporting to our organic results. This quarter, tracked consumption was 7.7% for our brands compared to an organic sales increase of 10.7%. In this environment, one might assume that is recessionary retailer inventory. That is not the case. We had 400 basis points of help from strong growth in untracked channels, primarily online, and 100 basis point drag from couponing to support new products. The good news is, as you heard from Matt, consumption and shipments are in balance, both low double digits. Consumer International delivered 11.6% organic growth due to higher volume, offset by lower price and product mix. This was a great recovery for our international business from a flat Q2. Growth was primarily driven by the Global Markets Group in Canada. For our SPD business, organic sales decreased 3.4% due to lower volume, offset by higher pricing. The lower volume was primarily driven by the non-dairy animal and food production in sodium bicarbonate business. Turning now to gross margin. Our third quarter gross margin was 45.5%, a 110 basis point decrease from a year ago. Gross margin was impacted by 110 basis point drag from tariffs and a 90 basis point impact from acquisition accounting. In addition, to round out the Q3, gross margin bridge is a plus 100 basis points from price, volume mix, plus 160 basis points from productivity programs, offset by a drag of 80 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, inflation and higher distribution costs, as well as a drag of 90 basis points for COVID costs. Moving now to marketing. Marketing was up $45.7 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brands. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales increased 230 basis points to 13.8%. For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to leverage from strong sales growth. Other expense all in was $12.3 million and $3.9 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 17.3% compared to 21.6% in 2019, a decrease of 430 basis points, primarily driven by higher tax benefits related to stock option exercises. And now turning to cash. For the first nine months of 2020, cash from operating activities increased 29% to $798 million due to significantly higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital. As of September 30, cash on hand was $549 million. Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $100 million as we began to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. As I mentioned back at the Barclays conference in September, we do expect a step-up in CapEx over the next couple of years to approximately 3.5% of sales for these capacity-related investments. In addition, as you read in the release, due to the strong cash position, the company may resume stock repurchases in the future. For Q4, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 9%, organic sales growth of approximately 8%. And as Matt mentioned, we have strong consumption across many of our categories. Turning to gross margin. We previously called 150 basis point contraction in the second half. Now we're saying down 190 basis points. The change is primarily due to nonrecurring supply chain costs. We also expect significant expense, and we have called flat for the year in terms of percent of sales, which implies a step-up in Q4. We also anticipate a lower tax rate. As a result, we expect Q4 adjusted EPS to be $0.50 to $0.52 per share, excluding the acquisition and earnout adjustment as we exit 2020 with momentum. And now for the full year outlook, we now expect approximately 11% for year 2020 sales growth, which is above our previously 9% to 10% range. We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 9%, up from our previous 7% to 8% outlook. We raised our cash from operations outlook to $975 million, which is up 13% versus year ago. Turning to gross margin. We expect gross margin to be down 20 basis points for the year, primarily due to the impact of acquisition accounting, COVID costs, incremental manufacturing and distribution capacity investments and the higher tariffs on WATERPIK. As to tariffs, remember back in 2018, we got caught up in Tier 2 tariffs for which we were granted exemption in 2019. That exemption expired and was not extended as of Q3 2020. We continue to work on mitigating that impact. Another word or two on gross margin. Previously, I have said the first half of the year was plus 150 basis points on gross margin and the second half was down 150 basis points on gross margin. And so our outlook as of last quarter was flat for the year. And then also last quarter, you heard me walk through investments we were making in the second half of 2020. Examples here included a new third-party logistics provider, outside storage to handle surge inventories, preliminary engineering on capacity, VMS outsourcing costs as well as other investments around automation, consumer research and analytics. So what changed now we're calling down 190 basis points for the back half or down 20 basis points for the year, and that implies down 250 basis points for the quarter. We have some supply chain nonrecurring costs. Here are a few examples. First, because of our outsized growth, I mentioned last quarter, we're adding a new 3PL distribution center. In the quarter, we again had stronger sales. And as such, had duplicative outside storage locations and the new 3PL distribution center that wasn't operational. So for a period of time, we had duplicative costs. We're also in the process of going through make-first buy decisions. And that will trigger a couple of asset write-offs likely in Q4. We have lean training across the plants. And finally, due to the great results this year, higher incentive comp cost that flow through COGS. So our full year tax rate expectations are 19%, and we also raised our adjusted EPS growth to 13% to 14%. Now that we're through the outlook, I also want to spend a minute on FLAWLESS. As you saw in the release, we had an earnout benefit of approximately $50 million in the quarter in reported earnings. We exclude any of the earnout movements in adjusted EPS. Some color on that swing. As a backdrop, we bought that business for $475 million upfront and a $425 million earnout tied to year-end 2021 sales. That sales target represented in excess of 15% CAGR for 3 years off of a baseline of $180 million of trailing sales. Our revised 3-year CAGR for this business is closer to 8%. And as such, the earnout liability comes down and earnings go up. We're still positive on this business. And the strong consumption growth the past 6 months is a great indicator for the future. As you heard from Matt, the company is well positioned as we enter 2021. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Matt Farrell: Hi, Olivia. Are you there?
Olivia Tong: Hi. Can you hear me?
Matt Farrell: Yes, I hear you now.
Olivia Tong: Okay. Great. Good morning. First, I want to talk a little bit about some of the expenditures. First, on marketing, can you just talk a little bit about the key buckets of spending and whether is it more about frequency, depth of brands being advertised, more mediums and the e-commerce investment that you're making as well? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Olivia, about 70% of our advertising right now is digital, and that's been moving up year-after-year. And it was accelerated more this year because of consumers moving online. As far as where to invest, we have a couple of big launches right now. We have ARM & HAMMER CLEAN & SIMPLE, as I described in the opening comments and also in the script. It's a new platform for us. It's got six ingredients plus water compared to many ingredients for the typical laundry detergent, and we think that's going to be a platform we can build on in the future. So we've been spending behind it. And the second is ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL ABSORBx. That's a new cat litter. We haven't had a strong cat litter in the category. There's been a lot of growth there over the years. So we came up with a brand-new cat litter that has a different substrate. That's 55% lighter than our existing cat litter. So we're getting behind that in the second half. The third would be FLAWLESS. FLAWLESS is obviously a new brand that we acquired last year. It's an at-home solution. A lot of people are turning to devices instead of going to salons and spas that are generally closed and have lower volumes. So we've been putting money behind FLAWLESS as well. And again, the other money would be on just brand building, which we've typically done in the past when we have the ability to spend.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I would just add, Olivia, to that, right the brand-building comment is maybe a quarter ago, we did have some met of stocks as such, but 5 of our brands were growing share as of last quarter seven this quarter, and we think it's going to be even stronger than that as we exit the year.
Olivia Tong: Can I just follow up, too, on the strength in organic sales, obviously very strong, but I'm a bit getting off of that in the SG&A? Because it does seem that peers are growing maybe not 10%, but close to it on the top line, and they're seeing a lot better margin flow through. So can you just talk a little bit about the SG&A? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yeah, sure. No, you're right. We're getting phenomenal growth on the top line. SG&A, we're not getting the leverage maybe that you might think because we're also making investments. When we talked about investments last quarter, that transpired across the P&L. So talking about marketing investment step-up. We're talking about supply chain investments, and we're talking about SG&A investments. And so as we look at analytics or we look at IT or cybersecurity or things that we can do to just bulletproof the company for many years to come, SG&A is one factor.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Olivia, we run Church & Dwight a very lean shop, so there's no shortage of good things in which we can invest across the company. So as Rick said, we got automation projects, not just in the plants, but office environment, new product initiatives, where we do a lot of test and learns, IT projects, R&D. These are all SG&A items.
Rick Dierker: Olivia, you still there?
Olivia Tong: Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. And congrats on the strong quarter. Matt, a question for you just on longer term guidance. I mean, this is clearly an exceptional year for the company. I mean, probably the strongest in the company's history from a top line perspective. And you're planning on 9% organic growth this year, clearly investing in capacity. So there's recognition here that demand is going to be sustainably higher in some of your key categories, expanding relationships with co-manufacturers, et cetera. So I don't expect you to guide for next year at this point. You'll do that in February. But should investors expect the company to revisit the longer-term algorithm as well? I mean, clearly, it would seem like 3% is not the appropriate number, nor do I think that's what's discounted in stock or in sell-side numbers. So maybe you could just comment on that. And then I have a follow-up for Rick on margins.
Matt Farrell: Well, in my comments, was it's safe to say we'll hit our number for next year, but we typically don't give the details or the numbers right now, as you know. But there's - we have a lot of tailwinds going into the next year, the biggest being in wellness - health and wellness, but also cleaning at-home grooming and at-home cooking. All of those things are tailwind for us. And we do also expect an improvement in consumer mobility next year, and that's going to help the PC brands have an up year for those brands that are down this year.
Rick Dierker: Yeah, I want to make sure you heard that, Kevin. I know we have 12 pages of material that we read through during the call. Matt did say that we have a high degree of confidence on hitting our evergreen model next year.
Kevin Grundy: Got it. Very clear. Rick, quick one for you, and then I'll pass along. A couple of areas that are getting increasing attention from investors would be the normalization or return of trade spending, as well as higher freight costs. With respect to promotion, we're starting to see that a little bit in the Nielsen data. You guys appear to be spending behind laundry and litter and household. Can you just talk a little bit about your intentions, what you're seeing competitively? And then, Rick, with respect to freight cost as well, maybe talk a little bit about that and maybe even broadly expectations from a planning perspective, and I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yeah. When thinking about the promotional environment, you have to go to household, and household is laundry and litter. So if you go back to Q2, Kevin, and you look at sold on deal for laundry and litter, if you look year-over-year, Q2 2020, Q2 2019, litter was down like 800 basis points sold on deal and laundry was down 1,700 basis points. The numbers were in Q2 laundry was sold on deal 19% and litter at 12%. If you go to go to Q3 and you look at laundry and litter sold on deal, you're going to see litter at 15% and laundry at 30%. So, they've stepped up a bit in laundry and litter. But if you still look at year-over-year, this is still a huge gap. So, 2019 Q3 sold on deal for laundry was 38%. It's 30% in Q3. So, it's still an 800-point gap. And then if you look at litter, it's also similar. Last year Q3, 23% sold on deal. This year, 15% sold on deal. So, an 800-point gap both in laundry and litter. So, as the in-stock levels have improved, promotional activity has slowly returned to normal, but it's still well below normal.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And I would just add to what the gross margin impact of that is, right. The first half of the year, if you look at price, volume mix because this is where that would show up, price/volume mix for us was, on average, for the first half, a good guy of 180 basis points, 170 basis points or so. And remember, we pulled back a ton on trade and couponing because we just didn't want to exacerbate out of stocks. In the second half of the year, that number was closer [Technical Difficulty] to a positive 80 basis points as [Technical Difficulty] promotional levels have started to return to normal and we're supporting our new products. So, while still positive, just a deceleration as a [Technical Difficulty] contributor maybe on margin. Your second question was distribution. [Technical Difficulty] of all spot loads were - wouldn't be picked up or rejected [Technical Difficulty] another way. And now that's up to about 25% of all spot loads in the industry are being rejected. For us, the good thing is we do have a big - a large significant part that is dedicated lanes, right? We have some customers that are - that pick up. And so it's more on their supply or distribution network. But I would just tell you, it's tight. Costs are increasing. Brokerage costs are increasing. But at the end of the day, we've done a good job managing that and is not as impactful for us because of our dedicated lanes.
Kevin Grundy: Thanks for the color guys. Good luck.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from and Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just following up on the commentary on the gross margin that you just gave now. Is it fair to assume that given the tariffs that were, I believe, started more in the back half of the year, right, that you had been hit by some of the tariffs, the tariffs in flow in - especially in the water flossing? Is it fair to assume that you're going to have lingering gross margin pressures, at least to the first half of the year, especially as you mentioned now some of the puts and takes? Or we should be seeing some mitigating or pricing as you go into 2021?
Matt Farrell: Yes. No, it's a fair question, Andrea. Of course, if the tariffs come into the back half, then there'll be more pressure in the first half of next year. But I would just put you back to Matt's comment is we kind of tried to give kind of an outlook and said that in 2021, we believe that we're going to hit the evergreen model. And so that does mean margin expansion, as an example, because we have to - it's our job to mitigate things like that, whether it's where we manufacture from, how we can increase productivity. Our supply chain has done a fantastic job. We hit an all-time high this year in terms of productivity. Our good to great program. And that trend, we think, is going to continue.
Rick Dierker: Yes. The other thing, Andrew, to keep in mind, it's always - we always tend to focus on what can hurt you. But you say, yes, there's going to be some pressure on because of the tariffs initially. But you got to remember COVID is also going the other way. So that won't be as high, those COVID costs, in 2021 versus 2020. So there's always offsets.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And let me give you an example because you might say, what happens if COVID spikes back up in 2021? Well, a big part of incremental cove COVID cost for us early on was just trying to ship as much product as we could to customers. And so we were shipping out less than full trucks. Right now that we've built inventory, now that we're building capacity, we have more flexibility to make sure that we don't run into that same issue again.
Andrea Teixeira: And then on the distribution centers, which, obviously, you're - it's the right thing to do. You're trying to get in third parties and all of that, and you're also investing a lot of money on your own capacity, when would you think on that end, you're going to be having the capacity coming through from a production standpoint and also the distribution? When you think you're going to hit those targets and alleviate those pressures that you said you called out as non-recurring.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, the great news is we just did our first shipments from the new 3PL this past week. And so we believe we'll be up and running almost full board in Q1 of next year, which is fantastic. So that's distribution. That's a meaningful difference in terms of our shipping capacity overall for the network. For manufacturing, right, if you do something in-house, it always takes about 18 months. But the good news is we said for vitamins specifically as an example, that we're going to go outside. And that's going to be outside for some small quantities already in Q4 and then ramped up really quickly at the beginning of 2021.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Also congrats on a nice quarter.
Matt Farrell: Hey, Rupesh.
Rupesh Parikh: I just want to start - hey Matt, so I guess just starting out the M&A. Curious what you're seeing right now on the M&A front. And does anything change in terms of what you guys are looking at from an M&A perspective, just given the pandemic and maybe some new opportunities you see going forward?
Matt Farrell: Well, we've had the same criteria for many years, as you know, Rupesh, so I don't expect that to change. At one point, we thought that there may be a more properties come to market in the back half of the year as the election was looming. I guess that's still possible between next week and the end of the year. We did do a deal once upon a time that started in mid-November when we closed it by the end of December. So we know that's possible. But I would say, with respect to criteria, it hasn't changed.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then you guys also mentioned that you may resume share buybacks. So is it fair to assume that you may prioritize share buybacks over debt paydown near-term?
Rick Dierker: Well, I mean, you got to keep in mind, Rupesh, that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are still 1 point - net debt to EBITDA is 1.1 times by end of the year. So in my mind, we can do both, no problem.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one last question. So there's been some question just around thinking about gross margins going forward. So clearly, you have some headwinds this year. We also have tailwinds from a lower promotional environment. How do you think about the base level of gross margin as we look to next year? Like is it flat? I guess, is it modestly - I guess, a 20 basis point decline in gross margins? Is that the right way to think about the new base level, or could there be more? I don't know. More headwinds this year that are artificially depressing that base level in first quarter.
Rick Dierker: Well, I mean, you heard Matt, and we talked about the COVID costs as an example that we think are extraordinarily high this year that won't be as high next year. But again, in January, February, when we go through our outlook, we'll go through it in detail. Today, we just want to leave you guys with that we're confident in achieving our evergreen model, and that means gross margin expansion.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: All right. Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the vitamin business. I know you guys have expressed a high degree of confidence in both it being taking a sticky habit. And I think, assuming that you can lap the performance this year with growth in 2021 has to be a key part of the outlook. Because as I look at it, at least using the Nielsen, not knowing, I don't have the full look of all channel. Vitamins is growing, is contributing maybe 50% of the top line growth in Consumer Domestic right now. So I mean, historically, BMS has been a fairly cyclical business overall for the industry. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about why you think this time is different, why you think that taking vitamins is going to be something that really persists as people's degree of belief that immunity comes from vitamins? I just think that would be really helpful perspective that feels pretty critical to the outlook. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. I think you're a little bit high in the 50% estimate.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Am just using Nielsen. That's why I try to clarify.
Matt Farrell: Yes. You're a bit over the line there. I think you have to remember that, when we bought this business, Gummies were 3% of BMS. And obviously, that's grown over time. And I think a lot of people have discovered gummy vitamins as a result of the pandemic. So you have a lot more consumers oriented towards gummy vitamins than they were in the past. So that's number one. Number two is we're not growing as fast as the category. In Q2 and Q3, the category, on average, grew 55%, and we grew 40%. We grew 35% in Q2. And this is consumption, Lauren, and 49% in Q3. So consumers are looking for product. We're the number one brand, and we're sold out. We're capacity constrained. So we're going to take the governor off the business as soon as we get this third-party capacity online, and we expect to get our fair share, which we're missing out on right now. And like I said in my remarks, it does take a while for a new habit to stick. But I don't expect the current levels to return back to 2019 levels. If anybody is thinking that's a possibility, I would steal that to worry.
Rick Dierker: And just to give you some color, Lauren, on - we usually don't do this, but since you asked the question directly, we'll do it. VMS, and this is out of the 9.9% organic, it was about 1/3. So 1/3 of the growth out of the company's growth. Laundry was about 10%. WATERPIK was about 20%. OXICLEAN, it was about 10%. Litter was about 10%, baking soda was 10%. So it was pretty broad-based in my mind this quarter.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. That's super helpful, helpful color. And then just on the CapEx…
Rick Dierker: The other thing, too, I think, that with respect to health and wellness, you got to also keep in mind, WATERPIK water flossers. So they took a big hit in the second quarter as far as the sales being down year-over-year. So that business is not going to grow year-over-year in 2020 versus 2019. That's - but this is a perennial grower. And this is a business that have been growing 10% a year since we bought it. So you got kind of a reset this year for WATERPIK. But there's so much growth ahead of us both in the U.S. and internationally. That's just going to get restarted next year. So long term, that's another one that's going to benefit from this focus on health and wellness.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. That's great. And then on the CapEx, just - and I know you've spoken around it, and maybe I've kind of missed the specifics, but the usual run rate is about 2% of sales, and I think you're going up to 3% to 4% over the next couple of years. It sounds though like for vitamin, it's more going to be a third party. So I just wanted to understand a lot of where this extra CapEx is going because I think laundry was added this year, to get just some more color. And for how long you think that higher rate of CapEx continues?
Rick Dierker: Yeah. I said in my remarks is approximately 3.5%. So - and I said it for the first time at your conference, and I think I did say 3% or 4% then, but it's about 3.5% for about two years, and its laundry, litter and vitamins, laundry, we just had - we just are experiencing three or four years of growth in one year in many of our categories. And laundry is not - there's no exception. We just - I think we talked publicly last quarter about how we were sometimes better to be lucky than good, and we had a line come on in late March, early April. And that's already fully utilized. I mean, really, a brand-new line fully utilized within four to six months, right? And so we have great plans for laundry. That business is doing extremely well. And so we know that we have to add capacity there. Litter, I think you heard from Matt, I think in the quarter, as an example, it was up 8% on consumption. We have some great new products. So again, we need to lay the groundwork for litter. For vitamins, you're right, we said initially you're going to go outside, but you have to go outside, if you need volume within months. Over the long term, of course, that's one of those businesses that we want to have in-house because we have expertise in gummy manufacturing.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. That's great. Thanks for all the time. I appreciate it.
Rick Dierker: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Good afternoon. Would you mind giving us a little more on ad spend, the increase here - your plans on increase to net spend maybe percentage of sales into 4Q? And also maybe some context of how much of the ad spend you're maybe pulling forward from 2021 into the back half of this year, given the strength of your P&L year-to-date?
Rick Dierker: I wouldn't necessarily think of it as a pull forward. Remember, Rick said that on a full year basis, we're going to be comparable to 2019. It's just that in Q2 we have pulled the way back because we had lots of in stocks. So we were spending at a 10% level. We're in the 13s, meaning 10% as a percentage of sale in Q2. Q3 was obviously higher, 13% and change. And then our fourth quarter, we'll be around 14.5%. So we have a lot of spending coming in the fourth quarter. And again, it's behind these big new product launches. We just happen to have two big ones coinciding at the same time. And so we're concentrating our effort in the second half.
Matt Farrell: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is, last quarter, when I was asked, for the full year outlook on marketing, I said - somebody said, 'Hey, 11.5% to 12%, is that sweet spot?' And I said, 'Yes, it is.' And if you do the math based on our gross margin outlook and everything else, it would have put you at maybe the lower end of that range. And now we're saying we're at closer to 11.8% for the full year, which implies kind of a step-up from where we thought even three months ago.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. And if I could - I know we talked about gross margins a lot, but just to try to understand a little bit better from some of the information you gave us is, some of the gross margin pressure sounds like it will continue into the first half of next year. But some of it such as duplicative storage and such sound like they are more temporary. Can you give us maybe a read on how much of the pressure is temporary? How much might be permanent as it relates to some of the things, you're putting in place?
Matt Farrell: Yes. No, it's a fair question. I would say we kind of - I would just go through a couple of different lines. We talked about COVID, right? And those costs should be rolling back in terms of some of inefficiencies on how we shipped, especially early on in the front half. The WATERPIK tariffs, that will be probably a headwind in the first half. The FLAWLESS accounting, the good news is we're out of that, the acquisition accounting. We've lapped all that noise, and there's going to be no impact next year from acquisition accounting, which has been a 40 basis point drag this year. So that's fairly significant. Commodities, for us, have actually - we've discussed this last few calls and resins and ethylene, for us, has been up the last few quarters. So nothing really new there. That will likely be a bit of a headwind. But then our productivity program, which I just said, was kind of hit an all-time record this year is going to be a tailwind and will offset that. So I'm not going to get into the quarterly cadence. I would just tell you that at this point in time we're confident of gross margin expansion for next year. And a lot of those investments you heard me walk through, for Q4 specifically, are discrete onetime non-recurring items.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.
Joe Altobello: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So first question you guys have been very clear that you're extremely confident in hitting your evergreen targets next year. I know, Matt, you talked about a lot of permanent changes going on in consumer habits, which are clearly net-net beneficial to you. So I guess, what do you guys need to see to maybe rethink those evergreen targets, at least on the top line heading into 2021 and beyond?
Matt Farrell: Yes, Joe, you got to give us a few months. I mean, we typically come out in February with these numbers. We just want to give everybody assurance that the evergreen models intact for next year. As far as how high is high, we have to - we'll come out with that in February.
Joe Altobello: Well, you said 66 days. So I think you were beyond that period, but just kidding. Secondly, on FLAWLESS. In terms of the revised outlook, 8% is obviously still a good number, but it's not 15%. How much of that delta is COVID-related? And how much of that is coming from other factors?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I mean, we're not going to get into that. But I mean, just know that, right, especially retailers were closed for a period of time, right? So that jumping-off point, the baseline is really was depressed. But if you look at consumption right now, and you guys see this, but consumption for that business is just really strong. And it has been strong for the last six months. So it's a good indicator.
Joe Altobello: Okay. And just one last one, if I could. In terms of online sales, you mentioned it was up, I think, 77% this quarter, I think it was up 75% last quarter. So do you think that takes a step back next year? Or do you think this is a new plateau and we could increase penetration off of that 13% base going forward?
Rick Dierker: Yeah. Well, look, one of the things that we found is that there are many consumers that rarely used - order online and now have discovered it. And more and more people are discovering it. And I think as we get into the winter months, and it sounds like this COVID thing is not going away, there could be a resurgence, more and more people get use of it. So I do think you may have one more quarter, Q1 where you'll have a big growth year-over-year just because Q1 of 2020 didn't spike as much as Q2 and Q3. But I do think it's going to - this March is going to continue, Joe, over time. We went back to 2015. We had 1% of our sales online, just 1%. And this year, it will be 13%. Now last year was 9% or 8%, this 8% going to 13%. So we had a big pop this year, 500 basis points, but we fully expect that this is going to be a significant part of our sales - online sales in the future. So we'll be well over 2020 in a few years.
Joe Altobello: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning.
Matt Farrell: Hey, Bill.
Bill Chappell: I guess, first question on FLAWLESS. Just any color around the timing of, I guess, the change of the payout? And is it just COVID related they couldn't get to the three-year numbers in part because of that and the weak start? Or is there something else on the outlook where you - that you were seeing that you need to make a change now?
Matt Farrell: Joe just asked a similar question, Bill. I would say that our original methodology was an extremely aggressive growth number, right? And it was 15%-plus. It was in excess of 15%. So as we go through and time gets closer to that end of 2021, we have to right-size those expectations. And yeah, it's been a little bit choppy because of the current economic environment. But like I said to Joe, we've had some really good consumption. We feel confident in that business and an 8% plus CAGR, we had sign up for that business every day of the week.
Rick Dierker: It may not be as big earnout as might initially been contemplated, but the prospects for the business are bright. So we think it's - the math is going to work out. This is going to be a real good acquisition for us.
Bill Chappell: Got you. Well, in the same vein of Joe's questioning, how do you figure out on contract manufacturing versus internal expansion for some of the categories like vitamins or other at-home type categories that you're spiking now, which maybe they continue to grow in 2022 at this rate. But certainly, it would seem like it would come back to earth. I mean are there areas where you're thinking, look, contract manufacturing makes sense for the next couple of years until we know more? Or are you changing your CapEx budget for next year at this point we need to step it up even faster?
Rick Dierker: It's a good question, Bill. It's a fair question. I'd tell you that, for those businesses, those are the keystones of the company, right? Those are the growth drivers. And we've had capacity plans in place. We have an outlook on three, four, five-year capacity and volume forecast. And it's not like it's a new demand. It's just fast-forwarding some of those plans that were already in place.
Bill Chappell: Okay. So, did you change your CapEx budget for next year over the past year?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Yes. I announced that at Barclays, and I reemphasize it today that for the next two years we're going to approximate 3.5% of sales as we invest in capacity for laundry, litter and vitamins and distribution capacity as well.
Bill Chappell: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning everybody. Wanted to ask on promotional activity, just out of curiosity, who's pushing increasing promotions or point of sale or any sort of step-up there? Is it being done because, as you've talked about, you've got some upside to numbers, want to reinvest, I know not all of that goes into the promotional activity, I know some of that's in marketing, but is it the CPG companies? Is it the retailer? Is it both? And kind of how do you think about that looking out to 2021, obviously, with a lot of uncertainty, but would seem greater than this year, at least in absolute? So, anything that could be helpful.
Matt Farrell: Yes. My comments earlier were that if you looked at Q2 versus Q3, that sold on deal has increased sequentially, but it's still down significantly year-over-year. So, the shorthand is both laundry and litter sold on deal is 800 basis points lower in Q3 of 2020 compared to Q3 2019. So - and the reason for that's recovered a bit is because of in-stock levels. As far as you're trying to figure out what's going to happen in 2021, look, it's possible that it could stay where it is right now for a period of time as opposed to keep creeping up because, obviously, all the competitors are benefiting from the lower sold on deal year-over-year, and it doesn't seem to be affecting consumption. But I think we'll just - we'll update everybody with our thinking about 2021 sold on deal or promotion when we get to February, but it's too soon to speculate on that.
Mark Astrachan: Got it. Okay. And then just quickly back to FLAWLESS. So maybe building on the other questions, I guess, why now in terms of changing the payout and the CAGR, especially given your commentary last quarter about seeing increasing at-home consumption given salon closings and such? And maybe bigger picture, does this at all change your thinking about which categories you focus on from an M&A standpoint, meaning more kind of the legacy HPC business versus some of the hardware businesses that you've acquired in recent times?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Maybe I'll take the first part, and then Matt can talk about M&A. But the reason we do it now is the accounting guidance says we need to look at it every quarter. And last quarter - in the last - really, the last two quarters, it's tough to go through the haze of the macro environment when there's a COVID impact or when retailers are closed. And so we're waiting for - as time goes by, you get a little bit more prudence on what's actually happening from a consumer trend. And while consumption is positive, it was just going to have to start at a lower baseline because of some of the retailers being closed and some of the consumption and demand trends. So, I guess, my answer would be, we look at it every quarter. We didn't make a big adjustment last quarter because we didn't have the visibility into the baseline like we do now.
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as the category itself, we've made a lot of investments in categories we thought there could be a tailwind. And so if you go back and we say we bought gummy vitamins in 2012 because we thought there would be a transition from capsules to gummies over time. And that's proved to be true, and we obviously benefited from what's happened this past year. And we bought WATERPIK. It was obviously a device, but we believed that gum health was going to become more important to consumers over time. And I think that's proven to be true. So we think there's a lot of opportunity there going forward. When it comes to FLAWLESS, FLAWLESS is hair removal using a device. And there's historically been a stigma attached with using devices - women using devices to remove facial hair, both face and brows. We thought that was going to pass over time. And we think that the COVID has - because spas and salons being closed, has helped the business because people have discovered the at-home solution. So as far as how that's going to work out, that's going to work well for both the seller and the buyer, Church & Dwight, as far as the multiple ultimately that we will have paid for it. But our criteria hasn't changed, and all of those investments meet the same criteria and be the number one brand, you've got to be able to grow, got to be a high gross margin, asset-light and either have a competitive advantage.
Mark Astrachan: Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Farrell for his final remarks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Hey, thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we're looking forward to February, when we tell you about our 2021 plans. So thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Farrell: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I’ll begin with a discussion of the impact of COVID-19, followed by a review of the Q2. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO and when Rick is finished we’ll open the call up for questions. I'd like to give you a sense for how Church & Dwight has reacted to the pandemic. The virus disrupted just about everything. Consumer behavior, retailer operations, our supply chain and how we work. We pivoted every aspect of our business to meet the new challenges. Initially, we had a daily huddle at 8:00 a.m. seven days a week to address employee safety, production levels, co-packer operations and shipment and patterns. Today, we meet five days a week. We increased our communications with retailers and changed our marketing messages. We moved people to focus on the online class of trade to create and upload new content. To speed up our reaction time, we created new data feeds of POS data and retailer in stock levels. We added more co-packers to our supply chain network. We conduct weekly surveys of our consumers. And all of our efforts are paying off. The agility and resilience of the Church & Dwight team shows up in our results. Our priorities continue to be employee safety, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands. Our plant, warehouse and laboratory employees have done an exceptional job in keeping safe, which has contributed to our ability to operate our supply chain. The rest of our employees are working remotely and doing a super job running the company. We have been supporting our communities through monetary and product donations, including the contribution of personal protective equipment. In June, we began producing hand sanitizer in our U.K. plant for both donations and employee usage. With respect to consumers and retailers, we are taking steps to increase both short and long-term manufacturing capacity, and we continue to work closely with suppliers and retail partners to keep pace with increased demand. A good example is our installation in Q2 of a new liquid laundry line in our New York plant, which was quite a feat given the obstacles presented by COVID. And as I mentioned before, we've added more co-packers to ensure steady supply for other categories. Now let's talk about the results. Q2 was an exceptional quarter. Reported sales growth was 10.6%. Gross margin expanded by 220 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.77. The revenue, gross margin, earnings and operating cash flow were all significantly higher than Q2 last year, driven by the increase -- by a significant increase in demand for many of our products. Organic sales grew 8.4%, driven by higher consumption, restocking of retailer inventories and lower couponing. Our exceptional first half is a testament to the diverse set of categories that we compete in and the strength of our brands. Regarding e-commerce, even more consumers have moved online. Our online sales increased by 75% in Q2, as all retailer.coms have grown. We began the year targeting 9% online sales. In Q1, 10% of our sales were online. In Q2, it was 13%, and we expect second half online sales to be equally strong. We continue to conduct research on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers. Of the categories that we are following, there is continued consumer worry about the ability to leave the house and concern that stores and websites will run out. Consumers report that they are consolidating shopping trips and continue to stockpile to ensure that they have enough product for a couple of weeks at a time. Similar to last quarter, I now want to talk about consumption and shipments. Year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns are back in balance for our brands in the 15 categories that we compete. We do have some additional opportunities in gummy vitamins and ARM & HAMMER baking soda as shipments are still well behind consumption. In Q2, we saw a double-digit consumption growth in gummy vitamins, women's hair removal, cleaners and baking soda. On the other hand, restrictions on consumer mobility drove double-digit consumption declines for WATERPIK, TROJAN condoms and BATISTE shampoo. People are just not socializing due to government restrictions under mobility, which has a big effect on some personal care categories. July consumption for the U.S. business is tracking to be over 10%, led by our gummy vitamin brands, OXICLEAN additives and baking. One-third of our July consumption growth is attributed to our gummy business. In July, and I think this is important, only two of our 15 brands, and that would be BATISTE and TROJAN, showed negative consumption. In contrast, in the month of May, eight of our 15 key product lines showed negative consumption. So consumption is trending positively. Now shipments. July shipments for the U.S. business are tracking to be up high single-digits. Shipments of gummy vitamins, OXICLEAN additives, baking soda and WATERPIK are all up double-digit in July. Our gummy vitamins have been on fire. Consumption for May, June and July has been averaging up over 40%. And there is an increased consumer focus on wellness, and it is likely that we will reach a permanently higher level of consumption. We are looking at third parties to supplement our existing capacity right now. You may recall that we announced our exit from private label early in Q1, and that turned out to be a timely decision because it helped free up capacity for our brands. Regarding our laundry and litter businesses, consumption is recovering. You will recall that there was massive pantry loading in laundry and litter in the month of March. The laundry pantry loading appears to be absorbed as our consumption improved from being down, low single-digits in the quarter to up approximately 10% in July year-over-year. Similarly, ARM & HAMMER litter improved from negative consumption in Q2 to up approximately 5% in July. So our two big categories are recovering nicely. In the water flosser category, WATERPIK is starting to recover from the steep decline in April, when consumption was down 55%. Q2 consumption was down significantly due to retailer closures, deprioritization of water flossers by some retailers and closure of dental offices. Remember that dental professionals are an important source of water flosser recommendations, which influences first-time buyers. The most recent surveys indicate that 95% of dental offices are now open, although most are at a reduced capacity. The good news is, monthly consumption of WATERPIK -- water flossers is now positive. Although, our lunch 'n learn activity continues to be significantly curtailed, we intend to address this with incremental advertising in the second half. The FLAWLESS brand has had strong consumption growth in May, June and July, due to reduced consumer access to salons. The launch of our new full-body device, NU RAZOR, was perfectly timed. FLAWLESS is one of our brands that could benefit from the at-home grooming trend, and we tend to strongly support FLAWLESS with advertising in the second half. Now private label. Private label shares is something we track closely. As you know, our exposure to private label is limited to five categories, and the private label shares were generally unchanged in Q2, and it was also true in Q1. Because of the virus, consumer trends are emerging, which affect our business, including a focus on cleaning, personal wellness and new grooming routines. These consumer trends may endure over the long term, and if they do, we believe we are well positioned. Now, international. Our international business came through with slightly positive organic growth in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our GMG business, that stands for Global Markets Group. In particular, China and Asia Pacific turned in a remarkably strong performance in the second quarter. And in July, our GMG business is off to a strong start. And we're seeing strong POS recovery in Canada and Europe as well is starting to recover. Our Specialty Products business has had three straight quarters of organic growth, and we expect continued organic growth for our Specialty Products in the second half. Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers, even in this economy. In Q2, we launched a new ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent called CLEAN & SIMPLE, which has only six ingredients plus water and this compares to 15 to 30 ingredients for the typical liquid detergent, and has the cleaning power comparable to our best-selling consumer favorite, which is ARM & HAMMER with OXICLEAN. However, because of retailer stocking issues in the second quarter, we eliminated advertising, trade and couponing support that we had planned, and we’ve pushed it to the second half. We're excited to report today that we have another big product launch this year. The second launch is in the Clumping Litter category. This month we began shipping AbsorbX, which is a revolutionary new ARM & HAMMER lightweight litter made from desert dry materials. It absorbs wetness in seconds to trap and seal orders fast. AbsorbX is 15% lighter than our existing lightweight, and it's 55% lighter than our regular Clumping Litter. We have a significant amount of advertising, trade and couponing plan for the second half to get behind this exciting new launch. And by the way, here's a fun fact, our friends at Clorox just posted to their website a new litter variant called Ultra Absorb. And we'll take that as a complement. Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Now let's turn to the outlook. We had an exceptional first half, and we were running well ahead of our original full year EPS outlook. We reinstated our EPS outlook with 13% growth, which is far above our evergreen target of 8% annual EPS growth. As in prior years, when we find ourselves in this position, we use the opportunity to invest in our future, which we intend to do in the second half. And you may recall that just last year, we had had this exact same opportunity to invest, and our EPS was down 4% in Q4 2019 as a result. This year, we just got to a similar point much earlier. Rick will provide some details on those investments when I turn the call over to Rick. It's important to note that we continue to take the long view in running Church & Dwight. Now in conclusion, there are lots of reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. The great thing about our company is we are positioned to do well in both good and bad economic times. The categories in which we play are largely essential to consumers. We have a balance of value and premium products. Our power brands are number one and number two in their categories, and we have low exposure to private label. We're coming off one of the best first half we've ever had and are entering this downturn in a position of strength and with a strong balance sheet. And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquire in a TSR accretive businesses. And finally, we have the resources, common sense and the ambition to ensure that our brands perform well in the future. And next up is Rick to give you details on the second quarter.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes an acquisition-related earn-out adjustment, grew 35% to $0.77 compared to $0.57 in 2019. The EPS increase was largely driven by higher sales due to continued high consumer demand for our products and higher gross margins. As we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earnout period. Reported revenue was up 10.6%, reflecting a significant increase in consumer demand for our products due to COVID. Organic sales were up 8.4%, driven by a volume increase of 4.9% and positive product mix and pricing of 3. 5%. Organic sales growth was driven by higher consumption, lower couponing and recovery of retailer and stock levels. Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 10.7% due to higher volume and positive price mix. We typically try to break down the organic growth for you. 6% is consumption growth, reflecting strong, tracked and untracked in e-commerce growth, 1% from lower couponing, and then approximately 3.5% from improving retail and stock levels. Overall, growth was led by ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and baking soda and OXICLEAN stain fighters. Consumer International delivered 0.6% organic growth due to positive price and product mix offset by lower volume. Growth was driven by BATISTE dry shampoo, FEMFRESH feminine hygiene portfolio and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergents in the Global Markets Group business, partially offset by Europe and Mexico, domestic market declines. Of note, Asia Pacific had strong performance in the quarter. For our SPD business, organic sales increased 3% due to higher volume, offset by lower pricing. And demand for our products continues to grow in the poultry industry. Turning now to gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was 46.8%, a 220 basis point increase from a year ago due to a reduction in trade, couponing and improved productivity. In terms of the gross margin bridge versus year ago, positive price volume and mix contributed 220 basis points. Productivity added 140 basis points, offset by higher manufacturing costs of 110 basis points was driven by 110 basis points related to COVID supply chain costs and then improved commodity costs were offset by higher manufacturing costs. Finally, a drag of 20 basis points from the prior year policy accounting impact and a 10 basis point drag from FX is how we get to 220 up for the quarter. Moving now to marketing. Marketing was down $6.8 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 180 basis points to 10.2%. Due to retailer out of stocks, marketing spend was significantly reduced and shifted to the back half to support new products. For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A increased 30 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive comp, intangible costs related to acquisitions and investments in R&D. And for net operating profit, the adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%. Other expense all-in was $14.7 million, a slight decline due to lower interest expense resulting from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 19.6% compared to 18.7% in 2019, an increase of 90 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. And now turning to cash. For the first six months of 2020, cash from operating activities increased 70% to $599 million due to higher cash earnings and a decrease in working capital. This includes deferring an $81 million income tax payment in line with the CARES Act. Within the quarter, we fully repaid the revolving credit line that was accessed in Q1 during the early days of COVID. As of June 30th, cash on hand was $452 million. Our full year CapEx plan has gone from $80 million to $100 million as we begin to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. And now turning to the outlook. Company is now reinstating the 2020 outlook, given we have half the year behind us and strong sales growth in July. However, due to quarterly volatility in retailer orders and consumer consumption, we will only provide a full year outlook. We now expect approximately 9% to 10% full year 2020 sales growth and approximately 7% to 8% organic sales growth. Adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 13% above the high end of our original 7% to 9% outlook. This implies a front-end loaded year and flat EPS in the second half as the company has shifted promotional and advertising dollars from the first half to the second half in support of new products. Turning to gross margin. The first half gross margin expanded 150 basis points. We expect that second half will contract by a similar amount. Half of it is simply the year-over-year impact of acquisition accounting. The balance reflects incremental COVID costs as well as WATERPIK tariffs, new product support that Matt mentioned, incremental manufacturing and distribution capacity investments. And so net, that means we'll be slightly below our original full year margin outlook. As you heard from Matt, we intend to make incremental investments in the back half of 2020. Some examples here include a new third-party logistics provider, outside storage to handle surge inventories, preliminary engineering on capacity decisions. VMS outsourcing costs, as well as other investments around automation, consumer research and analytics. Lastly, consistent with how we've been managing throughout the crisis, our outlook may continue to adapt, and we may continue to defer trade couponing and advertising even into next year, depending on consumption, the resurgence of COVID-19 or supply constraints. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chapell with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Bill Chapell: Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations.
Matt Farrell: Hey. Thanks, Bill.
Bill Chapell: I guess, first, just on those last kind of commentary, Rick, the way you accrue for advertising and marketing means that even though you've, kind of, postpone stuff from first half to second half, it doesn't really – didn't really affect the quarterly accrual. Is that correct? And then I guess, if you make the decision to push it to next year, would that then create a reversal or something as we look to model for the back half?
Rick Dierker: And let me try to simplify it, Bill. The advertising matches when we spend the money, right? It matches -- when we're trying to launch the product. So spend in the Q1 and Q2 for the -- for new product launches was actually deferred. So we didn't spend it. We said consumption was so strong. So in Q3 and Q4, that spending for the litter and laundry innovations that Matt went through will be spent. And so it's just – actually, the dollars will go out in Q3 and Q4.
Bill Chappell: Got it. And then just from -- I understand you're not seeing much pressure from trade down to private label, do you think you're seeing a whole lot of benefit from consumers trading down to your value part of your portfolio, or is it really just things are hitting so well and the premium side is hitting so well, it's not really affect -- and it's tough to tell at this point?
Matt Farrell: Yes Bill, it's Matt. It's hard to tell right now because, as you know, those $600 weekly checks have been helping quite a bit. So as far as disposable income goes, so that's been propping up consumers. It could be more likely that to happen in the second half. But when you talk about shares, I mean, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry was up 80 bps in the quarter to 13.9%. But I think it's too early to make a lot of judgments about share movements, particularly looking at the second quarter because you had a few months there where you had the shelves wiped out. And depending on whether or not that you had product on shelf, dictate whether or not consumer picked up your product. So I think the important thing to think about is that, retailer in-stock levels have normalized. And so now that you have normalized in-stock levels, you can expect promotional activity to start normalizing as well because that was all eliminated from the second quarter.
Bill Chappell: Got it. So you are seeing promotional levels kind of normalize in July?
Matt Farrell: No, I am saying, we expect it to happen in second half.
Bill Chappell: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Also congrats on a great quarter.
Matt Farrell: Thanks. It’s a pleasure.
Rupesh Parikh: So I guess to start off, first on FLAWLESS, at least during our check, we definitely saw out of stocks on FLAWLESS at some of the retailers. So just curious where you are from an out-of-stock perspective? And then as you look at FLAWLESS, obviously, it's now been a few quarters since you bought the asset. Would you say, it's now back on track as you guys are really envisioned when you made the acquisition?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, if you measure back on track by -- how sales look in Q2 year-over-year, we were actually up. So in spite of the fact that you had all these store closures, the people buying product online has helped us significantly.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And Rupesh, this is Rick. Just to the context. Remember, FLAWLESS was down about 20% in Q1. It's positive in Q2, which is great. Out of stocks are exactly right, when you have strong consumption like we've seen, above and beyond what we expected and we have out of stocks, and we're in the high 80s, -- mid to high 80s at retail when you do the blended average, and we expect that to improve by the end of August.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then I guess one more question. So as you look at some of the trends that you're seeing related to COVID, obviously cleaning strong, vitamins are strong. Like are there new opportunities you guys see perception right down the road just related to some of the trends you're seeing right now, in your business and from a consumer perspective?
Matt Farrell: Well, gummy's is an obvious one. To the extent that new product launches and gummies, I think, will be well received not only this year, but next year. I think cleaners, is, just probably an area we have an opportunity to expand. We're going to expand opportunity to expand. We're going to expand capacity there. We can improve our claims. So antibacterial claims, which we haven't had a lot of those on our products. We can now introduce. That takes a little bit of time to do that because you have to get it registered with the appropriate government agencies. But that's one that could help us, and that would be for OXICLEAN as well as Kaboom Cleaners and a few others.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is open.
Nik Modi: Yeah. Good morning everyone. I was …
Matt Farrell: Hi Nik.
Nik Modi: …hey, I was hoping you can just opine on direct-to-consumer, not necessarily going through, third party but obviously, the shift online is going to be permanent. A lot of new consumers coming online some of the older demographic, how do you think about philosophically, third-party e-commerce versus direct-to-consumer? And I know it's a very expensive proposition, but it seems like this is something that might need to be done broadly across the consumer space. So, I just wanted to get your thoughts around that. And how you think about that from a kind of build in-house or from a kind of build in-house or from a kind of build in-house or potentially do it through M&A? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Hi. Direct-to-consumer is a difficult path for any one particular brand to follow. Generally, to be successful there, I think you really have to have a great deal of uniqueness. And oftentimes, a high ring, in order to afford a direct-to-consumer website. So consequently, it would appear that the larger -- the dedicated retailer.coms, whether it's Amazon or walmart.com, commscope.com. That seems to be the destination for most brands, unless there is some uniqueness that can justify direct-to-consumer.
Nik Modi: Got it. And then, just from an innovation standpoint, obviously, you're talking about some new products hitting the shelves. How are resets looking? I mean, is this -- are you going to -- are your biggest retailers actually going to reset on time, in the fall, or is this something that's going to be a little bit off time?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. With some resets, we're delayed. There was a lot of disruption in the second quarter, just because rather than reset the shelves, the retailers directed the store personnel, just to get product on the shelves. So you saw some of that, the shelves. So you saw some of that, particularly in the laundry category, but I do think it's all going to catch up by the end of the third quarter.
Nik Modi: Great. I pass it on. Thank a lot guys. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Congrats on the strong results, and I hope you're both doing well. Matt, if I'd like to pick up on the prior question, just on some of the big trends we're seeing, but hopefully sort of tied into your longer-term thinking and implications for the company's top line growth relative to the 3% that you've targeted for a very long-time. So the focus on cleaning and health and wellness and retailer focus on core SKUs. So fabric care, baking soda, vitamins, all should be structurally higher demand. And it seems like this will have a longer tail to it. Things probably go from bad to worse than half for TROJAN. But it seems like, church should be a net beneficiary when you go to the portfolio in total, you should see higher demand. So how are you thinking about category demand longer-term as the organization is making decisions with respect to capacity and investment and potential implications relative to your longer-term outlook of 3% top line growth? And then I have a follow-up.
Matt Farrell: Well, we won't be quoting any numbers today, Kevin. But you've heard us say that we're looking to expand capacity for laundry and litter, and we're trying to debottleneck our plants for baking soda. And we've stood up some – a whole bunch of co-packers to help us on the cleaning side. So you're right. When you look at this year, you see categories that are down double-digits like Dry Shampoo, WATERPIK, water flossers and condoms. But at some point, those are going to come back, right? And – but we see vitamins is going to be at – expected that to be a permanently higher plateau. I think the longer behavior goes on – the behavior goes on the more likely it gets embedded in the consumer. So it would suggest that vitamins would be higher going forward. The cleaners would be higher going forward. That's just not as big a business for us, but it's a place we're going to invest now because we can see the opportunity with the anti back claims Baking Soda, baking soda, since people have at home have – it's been rediscovered. In fact, we're up double-digits in baking soda month-after-month. We got to debottleneck our plants. That could also be a permanently high consumption level. So it's kind of a rollercoaster year depending on what category you're looking at. But the best case would be all these categories normalize. And then we got a handful of categories that are permanently higher consumption level, which bodes well for the long-term outlook for the company.
Kevin Grundy: Got it. That makes sense. And if I could just squeeze in one follow-up. Matt, I wanted to ask you about the market share opportunity in the laundry category because I’ve been a bit puzzled by one of your key competitors' strategy, not referring to the one in Cincinnati and their willingness to see market share almost across the portfolio seemingly with the exception of its most premium brand. So while I wouldn't expect you to comment on any competitor strategy, laundry or otherwise, perhaps talk about the market share opportunity both in the value end and mid-tier of the U.S. laundry category. And then your expectations here, do we see any sort of change in posture? What do you guys have in your guidance with respect to any significant ramp in trade spending in that category perhaps in the back half of the year?
Matt Farrell: Well, laundry is our biggest category, and we've got great brands, and we like our prospects going forward. So we have ARM & HAMMER, we have OXICLEAN. You know we're exiting OXICLEAN, so we announced that earlier this year. XTRA, XTRA has over time, slowly been taking share from one those other competitors that you mentioned. And although share is down for XTRA, we expected it to be down because we exited drug earlier this year. You may recall, we announced that. But going forward, we think that we're in a great place. We think we have a stronger brand. And we are the opening price point. We're deep value detergent. So we think going into this recession, we feel like we're well positioned. And ARM & HAMMER, I said this before, we have an unfair competitive advantage. ARM & HAMMER is a over $1 billion brand. It's an advertised value detergent. And that is not true for the other variants or the other brands in the value tier. So over time, we continue to win, and we also innovate. So you saw on our new innovation this year with ARM & HAMMER, CLEAN & SIMPLE. Simply fix. So the ARM & HAMMER, just sum take page out of Brita's book. Over the past year, the number of households that are buying ARM & HAMMER has increased about 3%. And so the brand gets stronger all the time. It's our biggest brand. So I think ARM & HAMMER detergent is in great shape. And I think Extra is well-positioned as the opening price point deep value, and particularly going into this recession, we think we're well-positioned long-term. 
Kevin Grundy : Excellent. Thanks, Matt. Good luck, guys. 
Matt Farrell : Okay. Thanks, Kevin. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. 
Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. 
Matt Farrell : Hey, Lauren. 
Lauren Lieberman : I was hoping, I guess. Thank you. Two things. One was just a follow-up on the discretionary we talked a bit about the promotional environment. But I guess, without talking about competitors, I'm just curious why, like why do we think the promotional environment ticks back up? Is it big brand driven? Is it retailer driven? So just curious on why that's the right assumption looking ahead?  And then the second thing was just the -- I got a little bit confused honestly when you were talking at the beginning about shipments versus consumption and that year-to-date, I think, you said we're now in balance. But then said for baking soda and vitamins, you were still running behind. So just to clarify, that means there is other categories that are running ahead, and that's what the total company comes out even and if that's the case, which of those categories? Thanks. 
Matt Farrell : Yes. It wasn't really an aggregate. We said, category by category, if you look at shipments and consumption, they seem to be tracking each other. We just said it for a couple of them, there's still more demand than we can fill. That's all. So we can sell every case of gummies that we can make, and it's the same is true for baking soda. That's sort of what I meant. 
Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then with promotional? Yes. 
Rick Dierker : Promotional…. 
Matt Farrell : Yes. As for promotion environment, if you just look at what happened in Q2 is like everybody just eliminated their promotions and coupons. Look at the laundry category, last year, it was around 36%, and it's sold on deal. And then in Q2 this year, it's 19%. And similarly, if you look at litter, the last year was 20% and this year's second quarter was 12%. So just this huge declines in the amount sold on deal. Because you didn't have to, right? If you had all this pantry loading that was going on. Difficulty in restocking shelves. So it just made no sense and it wasn’t just the brands so the retailers saw that as well. So now as you kind of look ahead with -- so sort of, reverse is true. So you have those categories or in stocks are back up into the high 90s. If you looked in Q2, they were in the 80s. So once you get to high 90s, you said, okay, things are back in stock. And then we say, okay, people going to start competing on the same basis as they did pre-COVID.  And I think a simple way to think about it is you got 11% unemployment. And if -- who knows what's going to happen with this is going to be another wave of stimulus will be $600, $400, $200, when will that hit? And so I think the second half dynamics will be different than the first half. So we have to wait and see, and see if things do return to normal levels. But it would seem that the fundamentals that you need to have in place would be there. I got high unemployment if you don't have a stimulus package. You don't have panic buying, your in stocks are back. So that's why I'm saying, hey, there could be an expectation for the second half.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. That’s great. Thanks very much.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Powers: Thanks. Sort of, I guess, sort of on that same promotional topic, just on the balance of back half investment, it just – it feels like a lot is going above the line into couponing and trade as you've been talking about. And then with some of the other capabilities investments that you mentioned, Rick upfront, I think that implies higher SG&A also. But maybe you could just tease that out for me. And I guess the net of that is how much is left for pure A&P investment? And do you expect the A&P line to finish in that 11.5%, 12% kind of sweet spot range, or are we going to slip below that this year in favor of the other investments?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Thanks Steve, it's Rick. I'll take the investment question. Largely, it's a broad-based investment and it's hitting a couple of different lines in the P&L, but Matt's comment was right. We're back to – our assumption is normal trade and couponing levels. The shift in the first half is really just around new products. So the trade and couponing to support new products, those two launches that we talked about. We'll have incremental investments around capacity. I'll walk through those examples. That hits largely margin as an example. We did mention in my comments that we have some tariffs for WATERPIK that got reinstated. That will hit margin. Some of the investments will hit SG&A, like the R&D or IT investments, analytics. If I'm thinking about marketing for the full year, then you add the 11.5% to 12% range is still a sweet spot for us, but wouldn't really go into any more detail than that.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Just to add to that, Steve. We – for marketing, remember we have those two big launches, CLEAN & SIMPLE, a lot of support moved to the second half. And then we've got the ABSORBx, really cool new cat litter. And then remember, lunch and learns, where we can't really do those at the -- at dental offices. So we're going to be ramping up the advertising for WATERPIK. And FLAWLESS is a young brand as well, so we're building equity. Heard us say that we're up year-over-year in Q2. So we don't put some money behind FLAWLESS as well. So we've got good destinations for the dough in the second half.
Steve Powers: Okay. All right, great. And if I could on international, I think that segment had a pretty wild up and down quarter. So could you just – I guess, from where we are now, July forward, just give us a little bit more on the latest outlook there and how much of the volatility you think is behind you? And now more of a steady state, or are you still poised – still brace for more volatility as we go into the balance of the year?
Matt Farrell: Yes. No, you're right. The second quarter was wicked for international. The GMG business, which is our business where we ship product to over 80 countries did extremely well. But our country has really suffered. But we do think that Q2 is likely the bottom of the cycle. We should start to see improvement in the improvement in the improvement in the global markets as the lockdowns start to ease up. Asia should stay solid, and that was surprisingly strong in the second quarter. And we expect Europe, which had steep double-digit declines in Q2. It's got creamed. We expect that to be more low single-digit declines in Q2. And our July performance, by the way, is in line with what I just said. So we had that 0.6% organic growth for international for Q2. So we would expect that the organic will improve sequentially from here in Q3 and then in Q4.
Steve Powers: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong: Thank you. Just wanted to talk a little bit more about your expectations in the second half, given that July strength was pretty impressive. So can you just talk a little bit about what you think is restocking versus continued demand a little bit? You gave some numbers there. On your -- on the second half, like what's your base case assumption? Because your estimate seems to suggest a big consumptions could potentially accelerate from here. If you've mostly caught up to demand and you're going to the quarter pretty clean from that perspective. And I look at it, just compared to other competitors who have their full year guide. Yours is for organic sales that really isn't looking for much deceleration relative to your first half versus some of your peers? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Well, we saw -- July consumption, as I said, for the U.S. business was over 10%. And if you think to what was the organic growth in the second quarter for the U.S., it was 10% plus. So, okay, that's somewhat consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. Remember, the elements of that 10% in the second quarter were largely -- well, three pieces. One was the restocking and some was consumption and some was the lower couponing. You're making the assumption that included in that 10% is restocking. There's less of that in July than there was in the second quarter.
Rick Dierker: Just to add to that, Olivia, it's Rick is you said in the second quarter, 6% was consumption. One was couponing and 3.5% was shipments. Matt said in his comments, shipments and consumption are pretty in balance year-to-date. So that would imply that very little incremental shipments for retailers above and beyond what their in-stock levels are is happening from a July go-forward basis. So it's all consumption.
Olivia Tong: Right. Maybe I can clarify that a little bit. So you guys had domestic in...
Rick Dierker: You're looking for a bigger number, right, Andrea?
Olivia Tong: No, well, you said domestic consumption plus 6, right? And then you're looking for full year organic
Rick Dierker: Sorry Olivia.
Olivia Tong: …7 to 8. So I'm just trying to understand relative to the consumption that you saw in July, the organic sales is for a little bit better than that. So I'm just kind of trying to understand what your underlying thought is in terms of...
Rick Dierker: Well, our implied back half, if you take the midpoint, the implied back half for organic is around 6%. So we feel like that's really strong. We're not going to get into the quarters per se because we said all the volatility and variability is difficult to parse out quarters. We're just trying to give you a sense, more so than most people do for the early trends in the quarter, for Q3, and that's what we're quoting in July. Not really going to get into the cadence or sequence of each quarter on organic growth or what we think. But in general, the back half is still strong, because consumption is still strong.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Yes. Olivia, we had a better handle on that, we probably would have called Q3, but we don't. We're not really -- there's still a lot of moving parts, but we thought seven months into the year, we thought we had – we could comfortably call what we think the full year is going to be.
Olivia Tong: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just, if I could pivot to e-commerce. Could you talk about your penetration in commerce? And obviously, you've learned a lot in the last few months, how that's influencing your growth strategy on e-comm from here?
Matt Farrell: Well, people that didn’t buy online are now discovering online. So we’ve had a big pickup and we think we’ve benefited from all the work we’ve done over the past couple of year to put ourselves online. The web pages, the creative content, the storytelling, et cetera. FLAWLESS certainly benefited from online, since solons were closed and people move there and discovered FLAWLESS. WATERPIK also benefited as well. The WATERPIK crush because of bricks and mortar, people who were buying water flossers were not going to brick-and-mortar and we're turning to online. But I think longer term, because this has been such a focus for the company. We're going to – we benefited greatly. We think that the second half will be at least 13%, online sales percentage of our total sales or higher. So I just -- I think it’s a credit to our marketing and sales organization to where we are, and we're positioned to -- as people move to this class of trade. We don't expect to lose any sales. In fact, we may pick up more.
Olivia Tong: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question goes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joe Altobello: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. Just want to go back to your answer to Steve's question regarding the slowdown internationally relative to the U.S. And, Matt, it seems like you kind of alluded to the difference being consumer -- the difference in consumer mobility and lockdowns, international markets. But I'm curious, is that it, or is there some difference in the nature of the categories or your distribution channels in some of these markets as well that's causing that or cause that?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, you got to look at what the products we're talking about that international is selling. So international doesn't have the gummy vitamin business that we've got, doesn't have the baking soda business that we have. So if you look at the categories where we had big, big consumption, in the second quarter, you won't find them in international. So I think that's one of the big differences between the U.S. and the international results right now.
Q – Joe Altobello: Got it. Okay. And then, secondly, curious on the M&A environment. You mentioned that you guys are very much in the market for acquisitions. How has COVID impacted? The number of sellers, the willingness of sellers, the multiples you're seeing out there?
Matt Farrell: Yes. It's a good question. I've been with this company since 2006, and there's been good times and bad times over that period. Joe, there's always something for sale. So the -- even now. So I don't expect that there'll be much of a slowdown in the number of opportunities. And just remind everybody, we're pretty fussy about what we buy. We drive to buy as you know this, the number one or number two brands. But, yes, I couldn't really comment on multiples at this point. I think people always have a big multiples in their heads when they're selling businesses.
Rick Dierker: Yeah. The good news, Joe, is our balance sheet. It's just pristine, right? We're going to be less than 1.5 times lever debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year. And if you look at the net debt, we're just generating so much cash we're going to be closer to 1.1 times net debt to EBITDA.
Matt Farrell: Yes, that's good point.
Joe Altobello: Got it. Okay. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.
Matt Farrell: Okay, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you and good morning. So I'm hoping just to – if you can unpack the top to line drivers. And I think, Matt, you gave a bit of in this last commentary on obviously the vitamins? And then, Rick, if you can talk about the price/mix benefit for the balance of the year. And I know the bridge and engage like 220 basis points. But start with the vitamins, I think you said consumption up 40%, and you're now shipping to consumption. So I'm thinking July in that 10% that you quoted is probably in the U.S., it's probably about 300 to 400 basis points driven by vitamins. And then I understand from your commentary vitamins. And then I understand from your commentary about condoms like getting back that's becoming less negative. Is that how the way we should be thinking? And as you lap next year, I know, it will – I probably agree that, it's going to continue elevated, but that tailwind is going to go away. Is that the way we should be thinking like the 5%, 6% that included before for the balance of the year? And on the price/mix benefit of 220 basis points. So for the balance of the year, that bridge for the gross margin, that's going to either reverse to negative. Is that what you embed in your guide? Appreciate that. Sorry for that many questions.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. I think there were half a dozen in there, Andrea. I think your first one with respect to growth. Yeah, I did mention earlier that we had over 10% growth in the U.S. in Q2, and we're seeing shipments similar in the month of July. And I did say that about a-third of that is vitamin business. And it would seem that, that would continue for the remainder of the year. The pieces of the 10, I think Rick called out – would you repeat that again, Rick?
Rick Dierker: Yeah, for – it was 6% for consumption, it was 1% for lower couponing, and it was 3.5% or so for retailer and stock, retailer inventories going back up. And just to take a big step back, we also bridge typically from Nielsen. And Nielsen would have said, our consumption is 2.9%. So you can imply that it untracked channel growth of around 3%. That's how we get to 6% on track in e-commerce. So that's, again, just a reminder on that bridge.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. So I did mention that with respect to consumption that only two of our 15 categories have negative consumption in the month of July, and those would be dry shampoo and condoms. That doesn't mean everything else is flying either. I'd mention that water flosser shipments were double-digit in the month of July. The consumption is only slightly positive for water flossers.
Rick Dierker: And then in terms of gross margin, I think that's what your question is on price volume mix. In the quarter, we had positive 220 basis points. So for the first half, we've largely had positive 180 basis points for price volume mix. And in the second half, as you would expect because we’re getting to normal commercial levels, and we're supporting new products with coupon and trade. That number will decelerate. It will still be a positive contributor, but just not as much. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.
Andrea Teixeira: Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Matt Farrell for any closing remarks.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Well, hey, thanks, everybody for joining us this morning. We had a terrific first half, a great second quarter. And we do try to provide as much detail as we can to you and to investors, so they can get down to-date a view of where we are, and that's why we provide the July shipment and consumption debt as well as the consumption data for the quarter. And we'll do the same when we get to talk to you at the end of Q3, so.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference call. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight, please go ahead sir.
Matt Farrell: Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I’ll begin with a discussion of the impact of COVID-19, followed by review of the Q1 results and then I’ll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we’ll open the call up for questions.  I’ll start by addressing the impact of COVID-19 on Church & Dwight. Our priorities right now are the health and safety of our employees, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands. I want to recognize Church & Dwight employees around the world for their dedication to keep our company going during the pandemic. Church & Dwight has 4,800 employees and we are committed to each other’s safety. We have 3,000 people reporting to work every day who are keeping our plants and warehouses running. We are protecting our employees through temperature checking, working in pods, social distancing and frequent sanitization of work areas and we are sparing no expense to promote safety in our supply chain. We have another 1, 800 Church & Dwight’s who are working from home using Microsoft Teams. We had already invested in the tools to work remotely, so switching to work from home prove to be easy. We are learning how to be a virtual company. We are supporting our local communities with monetary and product donations to local food pantries and shelters, and donations of personal protective equipment and products to local hospitals, pet shelters and schools. And we are preparing to produce hand sanitizer at our UK plant for both internal use and for donations. With respect to consumers and retailers, we understand the need for our products now more than ever. We have taken steps to increase short-term manufacturing capacity and we are working closely with suppliers and retail partners to keep pace with increased demand in April. Okay, now let’s talk about the results. Q1 was an exceptional quarter, revenues, gross margin, earnings and operating cash flow all significantly exceeded our expectations. Our positive results were influenced in part by pantry loading in the month of March. Organic sales growth of 9.2% exceeded our outlook of 3%. Earnings per share of $0.83 exceeded our EPS outlook by $0.10. Reported sales growth was 11.5% and gross margin expanded in the quarter. Regarding e-commerce, more consumers moved online. In Q1, 10% of our consumer sales were online and we have seen growth in all retailer dotcoms. We expect to easily exceed our target of 9% online sales in 2020. Private label shares are always noteworthy. As you know, our exposure to private label is limited to five categories and private label shares were unchanged in Q1. Now to make sense out of March and April, let’s take a look at consumption, shipments and use-up rates. Our consumption grew 30% in March for our combined U.S. categories. For the month of April, the good news is that our combined U.S. consumption growth is still slightly positive. This includes both measured and non-measured channels. The brands with positive consumption in April included OxiClean additives, Vitafusion and L’il Critters, Gummy Vitamins, FLAWLESS, women’s grooming, ARM & HAMMER Unit Dose, ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda and Orajel oral analgesics. The brands with negative year-over-year consumption growth in April include First Response pregnancy kits, TROJAN, SPINBRUSH, BATISTE and WATERPIK and that’s consumption.  Let’s look at shipments. Shipments in March were up significantly across most of our categories, largely due to the pantry loading. For the month of April, shipments are tracking to be up 8% led by laundry, litter and vitamins for our combined U.S. categories and continue at elevated levels as we replenish retailer stores and distribution centers. Now with the backdrop of strong shipments in both March and April, we have attempted to determine use-up rates. We’ve been conducting weekly surveys to ask consumers if they are using more now than a month ago regarding categories in which we compete. It’s not completely scientific, but here’s what we learned. In April, our consumer survey showed an elevated use-up rate for household products including laundry detergent, laundry additives and baking soda. So for example, 20% of our consumers say they are washing more, which is good news for the near-term health of our laundry brands and stain fighter brands. The exception for household products was Cat Litter, where there is no reported change in usage. Regarding personal care, our consumers reported elevated usage of vitamins, nasal sprays, and oral analgesics. Most other personal care categories such as dry shampoo, condoms, pregnancy kits, and toothbrushes do not report an elevated use up-rate. So to the extent that those categories experience higher shipments in March, it may take some time to work those off. In our water flosser category, WATERPIK consumption was down 55% in April due to retailer closures, deprioritization of water flossers by some retailers and closure of dental offices. As you know, dental offices are closed except for emergency procedures, so there are no water flosser recommendations by dental professionals, which are an important source of first time buyers. FLAWLESS could be a bright spot, with 10% year-over-year consumption growth in recent weeks in April. With the closure of salons, female consumers are focusing on what they can do at home and our marketing team has moved quickly to change our marketing messages. FLAWLESS is one of our brands that could benefit from the at-home grooming trend. The dramatic increase in the use of Zoom, Teams and FaceTime has contributed to the interest in FLAWLESS products, so that women can be camera ready. Now turning to investments, in the months ahead, we intend to invest in our business. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers even in this economy. There is no pullback in R&D spending or in new product development. With respect to new product launches, many of our new products began shipping in Q1 prior to the COVID impact, although some retailer resets have been delayed due to the virus. And with respect to acquisitions, we are always open to acquiring TSR accretive businesses. We believe we are well positioned in an economic downturn given our balanced portfolio of value and premium brands and strong balance sheet. In times like these, it is natural to make comparisons to prior recessions for indications of how a company might perform now. In 2009 our organic growth was 4.2%. Today 37% of our products are considered value, which is similar to 2009 when 40% of our portfolio was value. We have 12 power brands today compared to eight in 2009, although two of those brands WATERPIK and FLAWLESS are more discretionary in times of recession. Our vitamin brands, which are Vitafusion and L’il Critters are in great demand due to consumer focused on health. And the equity of our flagship brand today ARM & HAMMER is much stronger, especially in the laundry and litter categories. Our international business is larger today with a more diverse portfolio and more opportunities to grow as evidenced by our 9% sales growth CAGR over the past four years. We are well balanced globally with more business in Asia Pacific and we are less dependent upon more mature markets. In fact, the international business delivers 70% organic growth in Q1 and weathered the initial impact of the Coronavirus in Asia. The 2020 economic downturn is not simply a more severe version of the 2009 recession. There are many differences that influenced the path-forward. We have social distancing, quarantining, government shutdown orders, retailer closures, the closure of dental offices and the decline of foot traffic and retailers. And there’s always the risk of supply chain interruptions and the potential resurgence of the virus later this year. Because of the virus, consumer trends are emerging which affect our business including the focus on cleaning, personal wellness, new grooming routines and a spike in buying online. These consumer trends may endure over the long-term and we are well positioned if they do. In conclusion, there are lots of reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. The great thing about our company is we are positioned to do well in both good economic times and in economic downturns. The categories in which we play are largely essential to consumers. We have a balance of value and premium products. Our power brands are number one or number two in their categories and we have a low exposure to private label. We are coming off one of our best years in 2019 and are entering this downturn in a position of strength and with the strong balance sheet.  So finally we have the resources, the common sense and the ambition to ensure that our brands performed well in the months ahead. Next up is Rick to give you details on the first quarter.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We’ll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes an earn-out adjustment and the gain on the sale of international brand grew 18.6% to $0.83, compared to $0.70 in 2019. The $0.83 was better than our $0.73 outlook, primarily due to higher volume associated with a significant increase in demand for many of our products in March, better gross margins and lower marketing. Also included in the $0.83 is a $0.01 drag from FX as the dollar strengthened with the global pandemic and a $0.02 drag from a higher tax rate. We did not have a currency impact assumed behind our Q1 guidance. As we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earn-out period. Reported revenue was up 11.5% reflecting a significant increase in consumer demand for our products due to COVID-19. Organic sales were up 9.2% more than tripling our Q1 outlook of approximately 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our global consumer growth of 9.6%. We have taken several short-term actions to increase capacity, especially for laundry and litter due to overwhelming demand. We were able to fast forward a planned capacity expansion for laundry and we made the decision in Q1 to exit extra laundry detergent from the less profitable drug class of trade. And then hindsight the decisions to exit private label vitamins and reduce promotional activity for Oxi Laundry were the right ones at time like this so we can focus on our core products. Now let’s review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 10.2% due to higher volume and positive price mix. Growth was led by ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, OXICLEAN stain fighters, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and baking soda, as well as BATISTE dry shampoo.  One question we usually are asked is can we bridge our 10% growth for the domestic business back to Nielsen. For this quarter, we have the unusual circumstance of Nielsen and our organic growth are comparable when actually there are two large offsetting adjustments. We had 400 basis points of untracked channel growth largely due to the strong online sales Matt mentioned. So we would say consumption for the quarter was closer to 14%. Our organic growth, as I said, was 10%. So that means inventory at retail declined by 400 basis points as we couldn’t fill all the orders in March. One thing to keep in mind during this time is that while scanner data is usually a good barometer for us, the current pandemic has made online growth well exceed brick-and-mortar. With much of the online class of trade not measured in scanner data, Nielsen data is currently less of an indicator. For example, for the week ending 4/18, scanner data would indicate that we were down roughly 10% in consumption. While based on point of sale data across all channels that we have, which includes online retailers, our consumption was slightly positive. International delivered a strong quarter for 7.1% organic growth, also benefiting from pantry loading. Growth was driven by ARM & HAMMER cat litter, liquid laundry detergent in Canada in CURASH baby wipes and the FEMFRESH feminine hygiene in Australia, STERIMAR nasal spray in the UK, and BATISTE dry shampoo in Germany. For SPD business, organic sales increased 3.4%. Demand continues to grow in the poultry industry. On the other hand, there has been a reversal in the outlook for the dairy sector. Negative market impact from COVID-19 could result in lower milk demand and the negative impact on the dairy industry. Turning now to gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin was 45.7%, a 60 basis point increase from a year ago due to higher pricing and productivity, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, COVID-related expenses and FX. The gross margin bridge for the quarter is plus 140 basis points for price/volume mix, plus 110 basis points for productivity, plus 10 basis points for acquisitions, less 180 basis points for higher manufacturing costs of which COVID costs make up 30 bps, less 10 bps for currency and then minus 10 bps for distribution costs. Commodities have moved significantly, especially oil. However, for other commodities like ethylene and resins such as HDPE, where they’ve moved down, it typically takes six months or longer for them to move in concert with oil. We entered 2020 about 60% hedged and no doubt commodities will be a tailwind, but unfortunately the COVID-related costs more than offset any commodity benefit. For example, in Q1, we were about $4 million of COVID costs and that was primarily for the month of April. Moving now to marketing. Marketing was down $1.7 million year-over-year. Marketing expense is a percentage of net sales decreased to 110 basis points to 8.3%. Q1 is typically our lowest quarter for marketing spend as new products have yet to be launched. We delayed March spending to the back half with consumption and in late Q1 and likely Q2 being primarily driven by demand related due to coronavirus and less by marketing activities. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 40 basis points year-over-year primarily due to intangible amortization related to acquisitions. Net operating profit, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 24%. This represents 130 basis point increase over Q1 2019. Other expense all-in was $15.2 million primarily driven by interest expense. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 23.2% compared to 21.9% in 2019, an increase of 130 basis points primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. This was a $0.02 year-over-year drag on EPS in Q1. And now to cash. For the first three months of 2020, cash from operating activities increased 71.5% to $237 million, were almost a $99 million increase from prior year due to the higher cash earnings and a lower increase in working capital. Our full year CapEx plan has gone from $90 million to $80 million largely due to delayed start dates. Pandemic has limited the access to plant locations and IT upgrades are being delayed. Our liquidity is strong. We strive to maintain our credit rating while expecting to be sub two times by the end of the year. As we’ve previously communicated, we’re experiencing a significant increase in consumer demand for many of our products, and thus, cash flow is stronger. Furthermore, during January and February, we proactively termed out our CP borrowings until the second and third quarters at favorable rates. Those actions eliminated the need for us to access the commercial paper market for the remainder of the year. Our current cash balances exceeded $1 billion as we drew $825 million from our revolver, given us ample flexibility. We’re confident in our liquidity, which is why we haven’t issued long-term debt even though the market is open for us. The great thing about revolver draw downs is that they are quickly repayable. Now turning to the outlook. The company previously issued its fiscal 2020 guidance on January 31, 2020, which did not include the impact of COVID-19, as you read in the release due to the rapidly evolving situation, the high degree of uncertainty relating to the impacts of the virus including consumer demand and global economy, the company is withdrawing its fiscal 2020 guidance. As of the second quarter, the company’s primary focus is ensuring the safety of our employees, sustain supply to retailers to keep pace with higher demand and maintaining the strength of our brands and that is really the extent to which we will comment on the outlook. Wrapping up, yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share, a 5.5% increase versus a year ago as the company’s 477th regular consecutive quarterly dividend. And with that Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Matt Farrell: No questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a strong quarter. So I guess just starting out with flows, I mean, really surprising commentary in terms of the strength that you’re seeing in April on the consumption side, even with some of your customers all, Bed, Bath & Beyond with all their closed stores. So just any more color, I guess in terms of our consumers now buying this product more online, I know you gave some more color of, I guess, women using more Zoom and using your product more. But it’s just really impressed to see those results. I’m just trying to better understand what’s driving that strength and where they’re buying the product?
Matt Farrell: Yes. In fact if you look at the weekly numbers, they went zero percent, 10%, up 35% year-over-year. So it’s been building through the month of April. And yes, you’re right. If you go back to some of the things we said, we said we were going to expand our distribution points about 15% in the 2020. So that’s done, check. But you are right that people are moving online. So we’ve seen a big uptick in our Amazon sales. And of course, other retailers also have the dot coms as well, but Amazon is up big time for us in April year-over-year.
Rick Dierker: And the only thing I’d add to that Rupesh, there is about 20% of that business has been retailers have closed down. So when we say those consumption numbers, that’s even more impressive.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Which is where you were going it’s remarkable considering the specialty stores are close and yet they’re up year-over-year.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Okay. Great. And then just from a – I guess out-of-stock perspective, so clearly, you had a strong growing monthly shipments in April. If you look at, I guess across other categories, like are your products now fully stocked at all the retailers that want your product? Or if we go to store, we still find out-the-stocks so, I guess, some of your key product categories?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I’d say if you look at that 8% shipment growth in the month of April, the big drivers there would be laundry, litter and vitamins. So that’s where you would find more of the out-of-stocks for us if we got wiped out in March.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. So there’s still out-of-stock even today in a retailer, you’re saying?
Matt Farrell: Yes, absolutely right. So we’re still playing catch up for those three.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. And then I guess my last question, just as you look at promotional [indiscernible] has been less promotional lately, but just any thoughts in terms of what the environment could look like for the balance of the year?
Matt Farrell: Yes, well, I can tell you what it look like in Q1. If you look at the laundry category in Q1, the amount sold on deal was down 280 basis points. So everybody pulled back. So P&G, Henkel and Church & Dwight all pull back in Q1. That’s in the laundry category. And litter, litter was up 20 bps for the category sold on deal. That was entirely driven by Tidy Cat, as ARM & HAMMER had pulled back on promotions as well as Fresh Step. It’s really too early to tell right now, Rupesh. A lot of retailers just eliminated a lot of the promotions just because people were going to stores, in any case, buying product. So they were reduced in the month of – end of March and early April. So I don’t care to speculate right now with respect to what’s going to happen in the promotional environment.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys. Hope you are doing well.
Matt Farrell: Hi, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: So Matt, I was curious for your thoughts on potential consumer trade down as we move beyond the social distancing phase of COVID, you’re in a fairly unique position, as you mentioned, with the mix of premium and value brands. So are you expecting significant consumer trade down? Have you seen anything so far that would indicate it’s to come? And how do you think you’re positioned for that?
Matt Farrell: Yes. It’s too early right now to make any predictions with respect to trade down. Once all the shelves get restocked, and we find that across a lot of categories, if you’ve spent any time in supermarkets lately, that’s when we’ll be able to tell, okay, what’s attracting consumers to move from, say, premium to mid-tier or to value. I mean, your question, I’m sure, is more directed towards our laundry detergent, it’s one of our biggest categories, and we benefited greatly back in 2009, we still have the – what I would call the unfair advantage that we are the only advertised brand in value. And the brands we compete with are Purex and Sun. So we still stand to gain should there be a movement down from premium to value laundry detergents. We feel like we’re in a great place, because if you go down back to 2009, 40% of our products were value, and today, they’re 30%. So we largely look just like we did back in 2009 as far as our portfolio.
Rick Dierker: And I would remind you that our organic growth in 2009, not saying this is what it would be, but as an indication of how we do in recessionary times was about 7% for the domestic business.
Dara Mohsenian: Right. Okay. That’s helpful. And then specifically on Trojan and BATISTE, you mentioned some weakness there versus strength in the rest of the personal care portfolio and some of the other brands. Can you just give us a bit more detail on the extent of weakness there? Is that a category growth phenomenon? And is that something you see lingering going forward? Or do you think that’s more temporary? 
Matt Farrell: Well, Trojan and BATISTE did well in first quarter. So now it’s – in April, a phenomenon. So they’re down significantly in the month of April. And the simple reason is that people are staying at home. So if you look at what’s going on with BATISTE, the – when we did the survey with respect to use up, that’s down. It was somewhat pantry loaded in March. And if you look at Trojan condoms, as far as the impact of social distancing and quarantining, people are having less sex. So it’s natural that Trojan is also going to be a down until those restrictions are lifted.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay, great. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Hey, good morning guys. And I hope you are doing well.
Matt Farrell: Hi.
Kevin Grundy: Hi, Matt. I want to start just on some of the tailwinds that have emerged this year and how you’re thinking about investment and how perhaps those investment priorities may have shifted. So consumer demand, clearly significantly higher. Promo levels down significantly, at least for now, commodity costs sharply lower. So a lot of things kind of going your way and understanding that you withdrew guidance, but perhaps even at a high level, Matt, just maybe talk about how you’re thinking about investment and how that shifted perhaps over the past two to three months?
Matt Farrell: Okay. Yes. Well, I mentioned in my opening remarks that the annual spend on R&D and new products is unchanged. In fact, that would be one of the destinations we’d want to spend back this year. Rick commented on CapEx, and we went into the year with a $90 million plan, we’re at $80 million right now. But for the simple reason that we just can’t get access to the plants, either we can get access to the plant or the third parties that might be helping us with the equipment installations. So we went from $90 million to $80 million. The other thing is part of that dip of $10 million was related to IT projects. Same issue there is limited access. As far as the trends go, I mentioned that some of the trends that I think are going to help us. One is cleaning, and obviously, we have some really strong brands there, not just ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, but we also have OXICLEAN. So OXICLEAN had a really big month of March and also strong in April. The personal wellness is next. So we – obviously, we have two plants, two captive plants that make Gummy Vitamins, obviously, in great demand right now. So naturally, you would think the consumer before are more interested in the Gummy Vitamins that are directed towards immunity or to help immunity. So that would be a destination for us. And the new grooming routines is the other one. People wanted to be camera ready. That certainly benefits FLAWLESS. So that would be on a destination for marketing dollars, to put more money behind that, because it is a new brand, and it’s one that we see a tremendous amount of opportunity and growth going forward, be another one to invest in.
Rick Dierker: And maybe one other one is just from a cash investment. We are investing a little bit more in capacity in the supply chain, right? We – I said in my prepared remarks about a new laundry capacity, we are looking at cat litter as well. We’re making sure that we’re well positioned for the future in this surge, laundry, litter and vitamins as an example.
Matt Farrell: Yes. In fact, Kevin, we have a new laundry line coming online right now.
Rick Dierker: And then also co-packers, right? I want to make sure we have backup supply, and so we’re also investing in our partners.
Matt Farrell: Yes, that’s a good point. One of the things I mentioned is we always have the risk of the resurgence of the virus later in the year. And also you have upstream risk with – in the supply chain. So it’s not just our plants, but you worry about suppliers of raw packaging materials and also co-packers so we can make some investments to make sure that we have some redundancy across our supply chain. Should it resurge or get any worse later this year.
Kevin Grundy: Okay. That’s helpful. I will ask just one more and then pass it on. From a capital deployment perspective, maybe talk a little bit about the timing there in terms of when you think, as best you know today, it’d be more viable to potentially transact? And then what are you seeing in the environment? We’re all kind of watching the same trends, there’s been an obvious shift to e-commerce working from home will become more prevalent? And then also, Matt, I’d be curious to get your – with those trends, point number one; and then point number two, the past couple of deals, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS, longer replacement cycles, more discretionary, sort of less defensive, does the current environment, informed the view at all? Do you think perhaps we would go back the next sort of asset you’d look at would be more sort of daily use, consistent with sort of the core portfolio? I’ll pass it on. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes. That’s a quite a list of my last question. Let’s start with M&A, Kevin. In my remarks, I mentioned that we’re open for TSR accretive right now. We have a very strong balance sheet, and so our – the window is open. As far as WATERPIK and FLAWLESS go, yes, you’re right. Those were two brands that have longer purchase cycles. FLAWLESS is a new brand, only been around for a few years. That’s a shorter purchase cycle than WATERPIK, Waterpik’s three to five years. FLAWLESS maybe more closer to six months or so because it’s a less expensive product. I wouldn’t say that we would preclude acquiring a device. Both of those brands met all of our criteria, that they were number one or number two brands, they were fast growing, they had high gross margins, and they were asset light. So whether it’s a device or, as you say, a traditional brand, either one would be attractive to us. And certainly, WATERPIK is impacted disproportionately right now in comparison to prior years, because of the closure of dental offices. That’s a big source of recommendations for us for the use of water flossers. So once that is resolved, that should definitely help that business come back to life. I don’t know if I hit all your questions though, Kevin. What else did you ask?
Kevin Grundy: No. No. That’s perfect. Thanks for the time guys and be well.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thank you. I just want to go back to the decision to draw on the revolver. I mean, Rick, your point is clear that it’s easy to repay. But just given the fact that sales are coming through so strongly, right? They’re talking about more of certainly seemingly more positive than negative outlook. You don’t have a need to tap into commercial paper, so why drawn the revolver at all? 
Rick Dierker: No, it’s a fair question, Lauren. I think it’s all about uncertain times. And I think in my prepared remarks, I said, we still expect to be levered less than two times by the end of the year, so you can infer what you want from that. But it’s really uncertain times, and we just put the cash on our balance sheet. We have no plans to do anything with it, and we’ll like to get repaid before the end of the year.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And the good thing about that is these things are easily repayable.
Lauren Lieberman: Yes, okay. And then just thinking about just the trade down, I know you said, Matt, it’s early to gauge. Just one thing I thought was interesting to look at is how much your market share in laundry had grown versus 2009, right. So it’s like, you said the only advertised brand in that price tier, but you really capitalized on the opportunity back in the financial crisis, and largely held the share that you gained. In the work that you had done, presumably even pre-COVID. Any thoughts on kind of the structure of the laundry category long-term? Because I think there’s an element of some categories, it feels like there ends up being a feeling to how the price tiers shake out over time, private label value premium? And any thoughts you have on what that could look like for laundry?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Yes. If you go back to 2009, our laundry shares were around 7.5%. And today, they’re 15%. So we’re much bigger in laundry than we were back in 2009. The shared donor over time has been the mid-tier laundry detergent, and premium has been winning and value has been winning. So consequently, we would expect that would continue over time. You saw Persil come into the high end, brought their product in from Europe, seeing an opportunity also presume it to grow share in the premium end.  And then on the other end, I talked about back in 2009, we weren’t even a national brand. We weren’t in all doors and all classes of trade, even for ARM & HAMMER. So we’re way, way stronger today and more recognizable as a brand. And I always say we have the unfair advantage of being the only advertised value brand. So I think we’re positioned for growth and value long term.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. That’s great. And then one other question was the marketing spending. I was just surprised to see that you could adjust as quickly as you appeared to just even during the quarter. Now that may be because you booked your marketing on a kind of sales curve basis, but I was just curious about that, because it seems like – it’s not that it’s not a smart decision, but very quick to be able to adjust intra-quarter? So I was curious about that too.
Rick Dierker: Well, Lauren, it’s Rick. I’d say we were only a few million lower in March than we had originally planned to be. Remember, Q1 is our lowest quarter of spend anyway. Usually, Q2 and Q3 are higher numbers for us. So it wasn’t that big of adjustment. And typically, we’re pretty nimble. So we were able to react pretty quickly in March.
Matt Farrell: Yes. We moved really quickly in March to move Q2 out to the second half, because we could see what was coming. So that tend to be a – it was clairvoyant on our part to make that decision.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. All right. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Great. Thanks. You guys mentioned tight inventories and that you’re catching up, but do you have a sense when you think you’ll fully close that gap? Is it 3Q best guess? And is it more at this point about your ability to supply to demand? Or is it about retailers’ ability to focus across categories beyond like food, cleaning, paper and water?
Matt Farrell: No. I think we’re focused on our categories, the three categories that I mentioned. Vitamins wiped that in March. And so – and that’s a big part of the shipment increase in 2,000 – pardon me, in April. But consumption is way up. We did that use up study. We learned that consumers are taking far more vitamins than they were a month ago. So it’s – I wouldn’t say it’s going to take until Q3. That would be a long way out. We’ve got two months to go here, Steve. So we would hope to, by the end of the quarter, to be – have resolved all of our issues in all classes of trade.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Based on what we know today and the incremental consumption is. 
Matt Farrell: Right.
Steve Powers: All right. Great. And I guess on the topic of redundancy, which you also mentioned, I guess, as I think about the go forward, I guess two perspectives on redundancy: one is from – on this topic of retail inventories, do you think retailers when they build back those inventories, we’ll actually build back more inventory to prepare for a potential recurrence in the second half or into 2021? And how is that factoring your thinking? And then, from your own cost perspective, is there a way to size some of the supply chain redundancies that you’re putting in place now from a cost perspective? And how much of what you’re doing now is likely to be like a structural cost that we’ll be thinking about into the future?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I’ll take the second one first, it’s Rick. I kind of alluded to what the COVID costs were in the month of March, and that would include things like co-packer upcharges or structural stuff like that. The capacity structure like for laundry and for vitamins and for litter, those are CapEx investments that we would be making anyway. And some of them have already been completed or underway. We would just be moving the time line up on some of those things. So yes, the – I don’t think we’re ready to really frame out exactly how big that would be. I would just tell you that it was $3 million or $4 million in the month for March. And one aspect of that happened to be some co-packer upcharges, along with cleaning costs, higher labor costs internally, donations, even our revolver fees are thrown into that. So that’s the second question. 
Matt Farrell: Yes. And your first question with respect to retailers building inventory. We don’t have anything conclusive on that right now, Steve. I did mention in my remarks that there’s the potential for the resurgence of the virus in the fall. The good news for us is that we have, for example, laundry, we have three laundry plants, and we have new capacity coming online right now. So we can build some inventory in anticipation of that to be even in a better position to take advantage of it were it to happen, the same is true with for vitamins having two captive plants. We can be – again, we can build inventory and we can be in a position should it resurge later in the year. So we like where we’re sitting right now, particularly with respect to those two trends: cleaning and personal wellness. And the other one as far as the new grooming and home trend, FLAWLESS, early days, looks like they’re well positioned as well. And even when everything opens up, I think people are still going to be doing a lot more Zooming and FaceTiming and using Teams going-forward. So there’ll be a need for that product as well. 
Steve Powers: All right, great. Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Olivia Tong: Great, thanks. Good morning. I just want to dig a little bit deeper into what you’re expecting on the evolution of demand and your view on your ability to share, given more value-tilted price points as you emerge out of the stock up-phase and then obviously into recession. There’s obviously a need to replenish at retail, but it seems like home pantries are pretty full now. So do you think the fact that home pantries are as far as they are helps or hurts you in terms of your ability to grow share when we come out of the lockup?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Well, you know, one thing Olivia is you’re kind of assuming that all categories are fully pantry loaded. And what Matt said in his prepared remarks, I thought were good comments, like for some of our big categories like laundry and vitamins, it’s incremental consumption and you heard Procter, the other day say that about 20% of incremental laundry consumption, we would actually agree with that according to studies that we’ve seen. So part of it is, there’s incremental consumption and like in April we saw big spikes in consumption for laundry and we’re still seeing positive numbers in April. So that would tell you that the deloading isn’t really happening. So it’s real consumption for laundry as an example.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Olivia on some of the things – some of the brands I mentioned where that had positive consumption in April were OxiClean additives, our two vitamin gummies, Vitafusion and L’il Critters, FLAWLESS was up in consumption, ARM & HAMMER Unit Dose, Baking Soda and also oral analgesics all those had a positive consumption. And remember we did the – the studies we did with respect to the people who are using more, for personal care, we found the vitamins and oral analgesics which is Orajel were elevated. And we also found that laundry detergent, laundry additives and baking soda were all elevated as well. So that’s why I said in my remarks, you got to look at three things, shipments consumption and to the extent you can get it some use-up rates and it’s not scientific, but this give you some indication of which categories will the pantry loading worked off faster than others.
Rick Dierker: Here’s a great stat on baking soda, I think in March consumption was up 65% or 70%, in April it was still up 55% or 60%. So as you can see, it’s just a consumption and consumption and consumption.
Olivia Tong: Great. That’s helpful. And then can you talk a little bit about your discussions with your retailers about how they’re thinking about some of the longer-lasting impact of this pandemic? Obviously, I’m not sure, even if those discussions can happen right now, since I’m very still focused on keeping shelf stock but as you come out of this, what’s your expectation there in terms of any changes in terms of brands or carry, how many products they shelve assortment? Just thinking about, affordability and also just how much – how many brands they want to carry. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well look, I think, we haven’t had those sorts of discussions with retailers right now. If you look at some of the consumer trends and some of what’s written about consumers is that, well known brands and bigger brands are more likely to do better than less well known brands and so that’s a real good for us because as you know, we have 12 brands that are very recognizable that are number one and number two in their category. So I think bigger brands, well known brands will probably likely do better than the smaller ones right now, because people will trust the bigger brands.
Rick Dierker: As you would expect most of the conversations happening right now are about supply and stock and those types of numbers.
Olivia Tong: Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay, Olivia.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Joe Altobello: Thanks. Hey guys. Good morning. 
Matt Farrell: Hey, Joe.
Joe Altobello: Just wanted to go back to something you just said, Rick, about what’s truly incremental, right, in terms of usage. If you look at your U.S. business, for example, the organic number was plus 10% this quarter that’s been trending plus 3% to plus 5%, let’s call it over last two years, 2.5 years. Is there a way to quantify how much of that delta stays with you for the rest of the pandemic? For example, how much of that was truly just pantry loading?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I know we tried to do a back of the envelope and it’s really a best guess is what I’ll caveat this as. But we would say for Q1, our outlook was 3% organic. We were tracking to probably 4% organic pre the outbreak. Our best guess is that part of the laundry, incremental sales in vitamins has incremental consumption in there. So maybe around 6% or so would have been organic in terms of consumption, driven with the virus and then the balance of that going to 9% would be the incremental for pantry loading, that’s just the back of the envelope and that’s our best guess.
Joe Altobello: Okay. That’s very helpful. And just secondly on shelf space, you touched on this a little bit earlier, but it seems like consumers are gravitating toward bigger brands, leading brands and I imagine retailers are focusing on that more. Would you guys expect to come out of this with more shelf space than you had going in?
Matt Farrell: Well, that’s the dream for sure. I think the ability to supply can influence the shelf space. So to the extent that you have voids and you have other competitors that may have difficulty in producing product or getting access to product we stand to gain. So for example, in laundry we get this new capacity coming on to extent through upsets for any of the smaller brands. We will be able to fill those.
Rick Dierker: And maybe one other comment on the pantry loading that we talked about last question Joe is, now for a lot of our value portfolio for lower income consumers, they don’t – they can’t afford to pantry load. So it really is a lot of consumption especially for the value brands.
Joe Altobello: Okay, great. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. I hope all is well. Just coming back to the CLEAN & SIMPLE launching spend. So how are you tracking and did you see how did the displays worked out in the different dynamics? And then I have a follow up on the bridge to the second quarter.
Matt Farrell: Yes, we’re super excited about ARM & HAMMER CLEAN & SIMPLE, Andrea, thanks for asking. So that started shipping before we – the COVID-19 hit and we’ve have spread out, we’ve gotten actually more distribution at the one retailer in particular than we expected and also as a result of COVID that we were able to spread out even more, so that’s really good news. It’s still early. Obviously the retailer traffic in stores is way down.  So to the extent of spending money on the displays, et cetera, it’s probably not a good spin right now, but it is on trend, this is a detergent that has six ingredients and most detergents have 15 to 30. So we’re well positioned and on-trend for the consumer that believes less is more.
Rick Dierker: And you were in New York, Andrea, you saw how bigger deal we thought it was and we think this is one of the biggest launches that we’ve done, period.
Andrea Teixeira: That’s helpful. And just to follow up on trying to breach the consumption and the shipments and I know we’re getting that both in the comments for the second quarter. You said the consumption outpaced shipments by 400 basis points all channels in the U.S. in the first quarter and you’re looking for 800 basis points shipments in April. So like just trying to bridge a new called out to the prepared remarks that you expect the destocking in May and June. So just trying to think about how the puts and takes into the second quarter, so you’re looking at a negative shipment trend in May and June or you’re still going to be elevated because of what you mentioned in terms of consumption.
Rick Dierker: I mean that’s – it’s a pretty detailed question and we said we’re not going to give an outlook. I would just tell you if you did a math, and even if shipments are zero in May and June, you still have positive shipments for the quarter, that’s kind of what I would tell you. But again, we’re not going to get into the trying to forecast the next 30 days or 90 days because it’s just too volatile right now. We can just tell you retail inventories are low, they need to get back in stock, we’re going to have higher shipments and some of the Nielsen reporting that you might’ve – may have seen over the last couple of weeks was just flagging negative consumption and we wanted to say, well, that’s not really true. It’s actually slightly positive because of all the untracked channels that there’s not visibility to. So it’s actually a little bit better. 
Matt Farrell: Yes. And we thought that providing some shipment information for April would be helpful so everybody can understand that kind of where we are. And that 8% number is the U.S. number. International is more around the 7% and even our specialty products businesses is running ahead for April. 
Rick Dierker: So, we’re really encouraged about the start for Q2.
Matt Farrell: Yes. But, can’t make any predictions with respect to May and June.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay. That’s fair. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is now open. 
Steve Strycula: Hi, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So my question would be on the decision to withdraw guidance a lot of companies are doing it so no real surprise there. We really want to just understand is this a function of achievability or just a wider range of scenarios? And I ask this in a context, because Q1 was strong, you have very little emerging market exposure, commodities are deflationary and the portfolio tends to do well during recession. So if you could just help me through the mindset as to why, how you push back against someone saying, well isn’t your guidance still pretty achievable? And I have a follow-up.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Okay, well, here’s, if we knew the answers to the following, which would be, what’s going to have with government shut down orders and how long will social distancing continue, quarantining in different parts of the country? Which retailers are going to remain close, when will they open? What will be the store hours? What kind of foot traffic do we think they’re going to have? And when a dental office is going to reopen? There’s just none of these questions have ever been asked, none of these conditions have ever occurred in a prior economic downturn. So we looked at those and we said there’s just too many other factors right now that are we can’t predict. So consequently, what’s the sensible thing to do is withdraw guidance.
Rick Dierker: Yes. If you would have seen this more like 2009 and it was higher unemployment or a financial recession we would have definitely just kept guidance out there.
Matt Farrell: Yes. I was with the company in 2009 and we did not withdraw guidance. And we have had a good year, I think company’s organic sales were 4.2% in 2009 and the U.S. business. I think that was up around 7% in 2009. So this is not just a more severe version of 2009, it’s different.
Steve Strycula: Okay. In that vein, is there any way to help us think about if we drew a T-bar about like what you’ve put in like parts you feel pretty confident about and maybe what are like more of the left tail type of scenarios? What would you kind of say that because you have added some businesses to the portfolio relative to where we were in 2009, any perspective there would be helpful? Then Rick, can you comment on what percentage of the portfolio is now hedged through 2020 and so we can think about, what’s locked in versus exposure for 2021? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well in 2009, we had eight power brands, today we have 12 and the four that we added were BATISTE vitamins, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS. And if we just took those, we see vitamin is in terrific place to be right now compared to 2009. And 2009 was really pulled the train for us, was a value laundry detergent, because it was a big trade down. Right now we still have value laundry detergent, its way stronger than it was back in 2009. And we have vitamins, which is a second engine to help us pull the train through an economic downturn. Yes, it’s true that WATERPIK is down right now, big time because of the dental offices closures. But there is a therapeutic need for water flossers, so we think and expect that, that should start coming back. I don’t know when those dental offices will open up, those recommendations will start again, but that will happen at some point. FLAWLESS looks like in recent days, we could benefit from, obviously that was branded off to a rough start when we first purchased them. But we feel real good about the signs that we’re seeing more recently in the month of April. So when you have more brands and you have more categories, you actually spread your risk more. So we’re actually in – we think in a better position now than we were in 2009. We’ve got a lot more degrees of freedom and a lot more weapons.
Rick Dierker: And then in terms of hedging, I said in my prepared remarks, I think we’re about 60% hedged in 2020. And we’re about 25% hedged for 2021, but you’ll likely see us not do a lot of incremental hedging in times like this as best to let demand play its course to see what happens to the commodity market.
Steve Strycula: Right. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. 
Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. 
Matt Farrell: Hey, Bill. 
Bill Chappell: A couple of things, one just on costs, I know it’s still early, but any kind of thoughts on resident surfactants as we move over the next few months, I realize your heads, but just kind of the lung, would it change how you hedge out as we go into 2021?
Rick Dierker: Yes, it’s a fair question. A little bit of what Steve said or asked, I’ll start with that first. We’re 25% hedged to 2021 and we’re not going to layer on in our opinion much more hedges because it’s really a demand game right now for those markets and demand is down. So we’re going to wait and see how those commodities shake out. But by and large, I’ll give you some examples, oil is down 50%, but ethylene is down 9% and HDPE is flat, Polypro is down 7%, that’s just spot pricing from February to March. And that just shows – what we’ve said for a long time is, it’s disconnected from oil unless oil stays down for a long time. So when I say long time, four to six months. So that could be a tailwind, but we have to wait and see how that plays out.
Bill Chappell: Got it. And then just on the marketing advertising near-term, I guess the question are you seeing or expecting some changing trends as we come out of this? You may have heard my state of Georgia is moving a little bit faster than others and as people go back to malls this weekend or just regular stores, be it pregnancy kits, be it vitamins, be it – or do you change some of your marketing advertising to kind of some to adjust for some near-term trends? Or do you really just kind of push everything towards the back half?
Matt Farrell: Yes. That’s a great question, Bill. Yes, all of our marketers have been very busy adjusting all of our marketing messages to be a contemporary in recognizing the change in consumer behavior we have in advertising. Now that you can’t go to the salon, fill in the blank, now that you can’t go to the dental office, fill in the blank, right these are things that you have to communicate to the consumer that recognizes the circumstances that they’re in. So we’ve been racing to do that for all of our brands and because of consumers moving online we’re spending a lot more money, changing our digital messages and we think we’re probably going to spend more on digital media as a percentage of total this year than we have in the past.
Bill Chappell: Got it. Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: Okay, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask on e-commerce adoption, so you touched on just how much bigger it seems to be. I think we are seeing that across a whole bunch of companies thus far coming out of what’s going on. What would be your expectations on how much of those consumers buying online stay that way and away from stores and specifically to your business, how do you think about your online position and share, and how do you capitalize on kind of that opportunity especially in key categories?
Matt Farrell: Yes, I would say it’s a permanent change. It’s a permanent step up in online sales. I think a lot of people who had not purchased online were late adopters, have discovered it now because of quarantining and requirements to stay at home. Do you see a big uptick? Not just in online sales but also click and collect, so buy online, pickup in store is up huge as well. So these have all been discovered by consumers. So I think that’s a permanent change and we probably got a few years of development in a couple of months for online sales. So that’s good.  How – we would look at that as a good thing. In 2015, we had 1% of our sales online. Last year, 8%, this year will we had a target of 9%, we’ll probably well exceed that. So we’ve done a lot of work over the last few years putting ourselves in a position to be a formidable competitor in online and I think we are. So we think that we’re fine with that trend, should where we’re to happen.
Mark Astrachan: Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Thanks, Steve [ph].
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Matt Farrell: Yes, I think we’re in a great position going forward. As I said earlier, we perform well in good times and in bad, we’ve got a terrific balance sheet, lots of cash, strong brands and we’re well positioned for what’s coming and we’ll talk to everybody again in August.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-01 13:00:00) =====
Matthew Farrell: Okay, gang. We’re going to get going now. Okay. Thank you all for coming today and thanks, everyone, who is dialing in from office or home. I’m going to begin with the Safe Harbor statement. I recommend everybody to read that at your leisure. Say who is with us today from management, we have our CMO, Britta Bomhard; our Head of International and Global New Products, Steve Cugine; our General Counsel, if you have any legal questions; Rick Dierker, our CFO; Rick Spann, who runs Supply Chain; and Paul Wood, who runs U.S. Sales. All right. So here’s – I’m going to give you a short story right now. So you don’t have to really pay attention to the other 150 slides. We had a terrific year. This is the second consecutive year that our company grew organic sales 4%. The U.S. posted 4% organic sales growth and 10 out of 12 of our power brands grew or held share. International posted 9.2% organic growth and continues to be a juggernaut for the company. And as we ended the year, organic growth returned to the Specialty Products business after two down years. Last time, we had an up quarter was Q4 2017. And the reason it turned positive is because the dairy market became healthy. And another encouraging sign is that domestic volumes turned positive in the fourth quarter. And finally, we had record cash from operations in 2019. So now looking ahead to 2020. We’re calling 3.5% organic growth, and that is net of exiting the low-margin gummy private label business. And consistent with our Evergreen model, we’re calling 7% to 9% EPS growth and that is top tier in CPG. Now I want to recap for a minute why Church & Dwight is a standout in the consumer space. Number one, we have an Evergreen model that our shareholders are very familiar with as our employees. Number two, we focus on cash. Number three, we have an ability to execute and that’s what drives our performance. We deliver meaningful top line and bottom line growth year-after-year. We have a very lean company with the highest sales per employee of any of our peers, and that sales per employee stat is an underappreciated metric. We are innovators with new product offerings across many categories year-after-year and we’re becoming digitally savvy. The 8% of our sales are online today and that does not include buy online, pickup in store. If we included that, it’d be much higher than 8%. But we made good choices when it comes to acquisitions. Those choices have led us to dry shampoo, gummy vitamins, women’s hair removal, water flossers and hair thinning solutions. So we believe there’s no better place to invest in CPG than Church & Dwight. So here’s our track record. Let’s go to the next slide. Here we are. So look at our last three, five and 10 years, we delivered double-digit TSR returns to our shareholders. And if you look at 2019, 8.3%, and that’s on top of a 2018 that was plus 30%. Let’s move on to the formal part of the program. So who we are, why we’re winning. Britta is going to come up and talk about them – give you an update for the master brand. And also Britta and I are going to ham and egg the consistent innovation story. Steve is going to come up and talk about international, I’ll kind of come back and tell you about animal productivity and how we run the company, and then we’re going to end with Rick on financials. All right, first, who we are. So let’s talk about our Evergreen business model. This is in green not only in the hearts of our employees, but all of our long-term shareholders as well, 3% top line, 8% bottom line. And if you say, well, how’s it going for you? And you look at the last 10 years, the average organic sales growth has been 6 – 3.6%. So where’s that 3% coming from? Well, it’s kind of 2% from the U.S., 6% international and 5% Specialty Products. We don’t always hit this in the market any one year, but that is the long-term algorithm. If you say, what are your brands? We have lots and lots of brands. Well, we have 12 power brands. And those 12 power brands account for 80% of our revenues and profits. And we have very well-balanced portfolio. A little bit more than half is – or consumer products part of the house. For those of you at home, those are just couple of balloons going off. The personal care, 49%; household, 44%; and you can see Specialty Products at 7%. Now it’s a diversified portfolio, in that, 63% is premium and 37% is value. That means we perform well in virtually any economy. And we have a lot of runway for international. So international has been a juggernaut, as I’ve said, for the last five years, still only 70% of the company. So we’ve got a long way to go there. And we do operate in the land of the giants. You can see, we have $4.4 billion in sales, all of our competitors are significantly larger than we are. We think this gives us an advantage. So we’re fast, we’re nimble. When you have only 4,700 – 4,800 employees, you can make quick decisions, you can move fast, your communication is easier, and you can adapt to change better. And we have a long history of acquisitions. We’ve added almost $3 billion in sales since 2004 over the last 15 years, and a lot of that came from acquisitions. And we have very specific acquisition criteria. We’re only going to look for a brand that has number one or number two share, high-growth, high-margin, needs to be asset-light. We need to be able to leverage our supply chain footprint and they must have a sustainable competitive advantage. And since the year 2000, so over the last 19, 20 years, we’ve acquired 11 out of our 12 power brands. In the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. So what we say around the house is 12 brands today, 20 tomorrow. Now why are we winning? We have five reasons. One, we’re in the right categories; two, we know how to grow shares; three, we don’t have a high exposure to private label. We’re growing online and we are on trend. So let’s look at the categories. So if you look at the categories over the last four years, in general, our categories’ weighted average grow 3%. So this is the underpinning for the company’s long-term organic growth of 3%. As far as growing share, this is our report card. You don’t get this report card for many CPG companies. but every year, we tell you how we’re doing. So for our 12 major brands, we maintain our growth share. And you can see this year for the first time 10 out of 12, we’re green. And we get lots of questions generally about the laundry category. So what’s the long-term trend in laundry? So over the last three years, we’ve had 120 basis points of share in laundry. The other winner was Procter & Gamble and Henkel has struggled. Now, you know, as we go from quarter-to-quarter, you’ll have some questions on non-measured channels. Let me give you a sense for how big our non-measured channels for some of our categories. Most of these categories are going to be 70%, 80%, 90% represented on Nielsen. But if you go to the far right, you’ll see some of our more recent categories, power flossing, hair thinning and even electric – women’s electric grooming are all significantly less than 50%. So something to bear in mind going forward. We have low exposure to private label. The weighted average share of private label for our categories is only 12%. Only five of our categories have private label exposure. And as you can see from the lines on that chart, you can see it’s relatively stable and we’re growing online. Back in 2015, we were fourth quartile when it came to online sales. Today, we are first quartile. We hit our goal of 8% in 2019 and we have a goal to be over 9% in 2020, and we have lots of products – number one products on Amazon. And Amazon, of course, is the number one online retailer. Okay, on trend. So we’re all through four of our brands and while we think we’re on trend. Take BATISTE, it’s a business we acquired in 2011. So dry shampoo was a convenient solution to women between wet shampoos. This was a business with $20 million in sales in 2011. If you look at what kind of runway do you have in the U.S.? Well, in the U.S., 125 million women – there are 125 million women over the age of 18. Two-thirds of them don’t wash their hair every day and 13% of them today use dry shampoo. Now, if you look at household penetration, it’s only 7.5% in the U.S. So that’s why we’re trying to figure out, well, how big could it be in the U.S. We look at the UK. The UK is the most mature dry shampoo market, that’s where it originated. So if we compare with where the U.S. is, the U.S. is in the middle innings. And we can see by in comparison to where the UK is that the dry shampoo market will double from $225 million at retail to $450 million over time. So being the number one dry shampoo means, we have a lot of runway ahead of us. So next up is women’s electric hair removal. So we bought the number one women’s electric hair remover in FLAWLESS. So these are tools to remove – so I’ll go left to right, face, brow, leg and whole body. So women are looking for convenient ways to remove hair. And if you look at the household penetration, it’s only 2% in the U.S. and less than 2% rest of the world, so a lot of runway here for this business. Next up is water flossers. We have the number power pulse and recommended by the ADA. So what’s the story there? We can do a show of hands. Everybody knows, 80% of the people don’t floss everyday, even though they should. And consumers are discovering water flossers. Water flossers are the easiest solution to flossing. Again, look at household penetration. 22% in the U.S. not bad, but we think that could go as high as 48% if you just look at the penetration for electric toothbrushes. And then if you look at – in Europe, for example, it’s only 3% to 5%. So we’re just getting started with water flossers outside the U.S. Again, on trend, got a lot – lots of runway ahead of us. Next up is gummy vitamins. You know the story pretty well. The gummy form is more appealing than pills and capsules. And if you go back to when we bought the business, the adult gummy form was 3% of the category. Now it’s 18%. And if you look at the size of the category, it just continues to grow. It grew from 2015 to 2016, 2017 from $800 million to $1.5 billion today, lots of runway. And then finally, is hair thinning solutions. We have the number one hair fiber and the number one hair thinning supplement. We all know it’s on people’s mind. 40% of men and women have noticeable hair loss by the age of 40. So we have great solutions to that. And now I’m going to bring up Britta to talk about the master brand.
Britta Bomhard: Okay. Hello, everyone. [indiscernible] So you might remember, ARM & HAMMER is by far our biggest brands. It’s more than a million – billion, sorry, dollar brand. So really important to us. And you might remember from last year, we presented our more Power to You campaign year in this iconic institution. Now, I know most of you are pretty skeptical. You’re a little bit like my boss. Is this really working? So I thought, why don’t I share a couple of results first. Since we launched the campaign in 12 months, we’ve actually added 2.6 million households who are now buying ARM & HAMMER, and that’s an increase of 3%. And this picture you’re seeing is actually, it is currently nearly seven out of 10 households buying ARM & HAMMER. And if this room is representative, my ambition is actually to have three out of four households buying ARM & HAMMER. So you might remember, there’s not many where the U.S. is as united as having three out of four people agree that this is a great choice. But what’s more important? You could now say, well, but you get them in via promotions? No. Actually, we have people spent more money on ARM & HAMMER, and you see here they’re spending 5% more. So if you think about it, what is a great sign for brand health? More people buying it and spending more. So I think that’s very clear answer that ARM & HAMMER is very healthy and growing wonderfully, right? There we go. And I think for those of you who saw it last year, you might want to note that we have ARM & HAMMER every single one of our brands and categories. And I want to show you a couple of how we communicate about ARM & HAMMER. And for those of you who have seen some of our cats, they just got cuter. So just have a look at the cats. [Commercials] That’s a really distinctive campaign and it’s working really well for us. You might not have seen this campaign, because we just recently launched our ARM & HAMMER dental campaign at the very end of last year, it’s a very hard one to break through. So I hope, A, you appreciate how different it is to a normal dental commercial you might see; and secondly, it also illustrates that this campaign works in no matter what category. So let’s look at that one. [Commercials] Challenged and check, how well the plaque removal is currently on what you use. And moving on to our next, you might know, if you’re not part of the Burning Man crowd, and I’m pretty sure most of us here in this room aren’t, then this one is what we say is a great deodorant. [Commercials] This is a broad spectrum of what we can do with the ARM & HAMMER campaign on every single of those different categories, playing to what’s important and what’s the consumer insight, but still bringing it all together and driving the overall 1 billion brands. So I think that’s pretty unique. But I’m actually here to talk about something new. Well, it’s not too much of a rear wheel as it’s standing or sitting on all your tables, but our new CLEAN & SIMPLE laundry detergent. It’s clean, it’s simple, it’s smart and it’s powerful. So what have we learned about consumers and you might have seen that in a few other areas. In food, the transparency in less is more in ingredients has already been quite established. And this trend is now moving from what people ingested to what’s on me and then to what’s around me. And this is where we have an amazing detergent, which has a no compromise, powerful, clean laundry with a simple ingredient list. So none of the others offer that. And what’s even better of it and it’s a pity that my colleague, Carlos, who heads up our R&D, is not here today. But he and his team are really revolutionizing of how we look at making innovation. One part is, there’s a very different innovation in culture. We are connecting the different teams around R&D and the different areas of expertise, a lot more risk-taking and obviously speed. And that’s what you can see here how we came up and looking at what’s happening in the food industry, it’s a very clear trend, which will come into the other areas. And that’s where our future works team actually discovered the CLEAN & SIMPLE formulation. So what’s in there, or better what’s not in there? Because that’s what consumers are asking. So it doesn’t have dyes, no added preservatives, no phosphates, no brighteners and no parabens. It sounds pretty attractive, doesn’t it? But what’s in there is six Essential Ingredients: a hard-working cleaner, active stain remover, laundry booster, baking soda, of course, water softener and fragrance. And what is more and important, it has few ingredients, but it is as powerful as our best selling product, which is ARM & HAMMER with OXICLEAN. And as we said, it has fewer ingredients not only as our own, but a typical average laundry detergent has between 15 and 30 ingredients, so we only have six. And here, less is more. But not only that, it’s also very good for the environment. So on the next iteration of laundry bottles, you will actually see this back label, which we’ll talk about our partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation, where we help planting trees for cleaner air and water. This product is also being elected as a Safer Choice, so we have that endorsement, which is very important to reassure consumers. And we’re also using the Green-e, which says it’s 100% certified renewable electricity. And, of course, we’re one of the leading partners of how to recycle, which is in a lot of our labels and also graces this label as the bottle is fully recyclable. And now you wonder how will we tell consumers about it. So let’s have… [Commercials] I hope you noticed. We’re helping women making the right choices and we have very positive feedback, because it’s such a good way to get it from a trusted brand like ARM & HAMMER. And once we drive people to store, this is what they will see in the future. We have massive executions in stores and coming soon, Dollar General. Sorry, that was too quick, can you go back? Wait, if I can do that. So what else do consumers want besides CLEAN & SIMPLE? There’s other trends, which are about sustainability and convenience. And Matt talked about online shopping, lots and lots of more people actually order online, that’s not as developed in the laundry area, because it’s difficult to ship big bottles. So we have a solution for consumers who want convenience and sustainability, because we have launched ARM & HAMMER plus OXICLEAN, our best seller as a super concentrated laundry detergent. It has three times more cleaning power, but it has 37% less plastic and uses 30% less water. So, again, fully on a sustainability trend and available to consumers who prefer shopping on e-commerce. I’ve talked a lot about ARM & HAMMER. We also have another exciting brand, OXICLEAN. And if I look around the room, except for everybody who is on my team today, you know that black clothes, dark clothes are very important. And about 42% of all wash loads get sorted into black, dark colors and we have a solution for that. So OxiClean Dark Protect, which is specifically formulated for dark and black fabrics. So as we’re now in winter season, take a note, you might want to get one of those. And with that, I hand it over to Matt, who is going to share insights on hair care.
Matthew Farrell: All right. Obviously, I’m the expert on dry shampoo. So if you’re somebody with normal hair and you pick up an aerosol can of dry shampoo, that’s okay, that might make my hair dryer. So we said, “Hey, what’s going to appeal to women with normal to dry hair?” So we said, “Okay, we’re going to launch Batiste Waterless Cleansing Foam. So this is something that you rub into your hair and refreshes your hair and dries in 60 seconds, and we have four different variants we’re launching right now. And now WATERPIK. You also often hear us talk about WATERPIK water flossers. Well, WATERPIK, that business, we’re experts in water-jet technology. So that technology has been around for almost 50 years. And so now we’re coming out with a brand-new, the first-known FDA-registered showerhead. And the insight here is that, millions of Americans discuss massage with their doctors, it’s something that WATERPIK folks look into. So here it is, WATER FOR WELLNESS, this FDA-registered power pulse showerhead. And we’ve done nine clinical studies. And what those studies tell us is that, these particular showerheads soothes muscles, they increase flexibility and they promote better sleep. And here’s kind of a fun fact. The average shower is eight to 12 minutes. And what our consumers tell us is that, these benefits they start feeling after two minutes using these showerheads, really cool innovation. Okay, I talked a little bit about FLAWLESS earlier. Women are look – are focused on convenient hair removal. So new product from FLAWLESS called NU RAZOR. This is waterless, whole body hair removal anywhere, anytime. Now, floss, we’ve got a lot of interest in FLAWLESS on the part of analysts and shareholders. So let’s give a little bit of update on that. One major retailer right now, the reset has already happened from As Seen On TV through the wet shave aisle, and that’s happening in a lot of retailers. Why is that important? It’s because the traffic in the wet shave aisle is four times the traffic in As Seen On TV. So this is launching right now with one major retailer, wherein after two weeks, the POS consumption is up 7%, and that’s just one major retailer. We know what kind of wins we have for 2020 and our total distribution point is going to be up 15% in 2020. And recall, if you read it in the press release that we expect the FLAWLESS sales to be up to 15% and this is part of the underpinning for that, as well as the NU RAZOR launch, we think we’re going to be in good shape for the coming year. All right. Next up is natural toothpastes are growing 14 times the rate of the toothpaste category. So we’re introducing ARM & HAMMER Essentials Toothpaste, two different variants, and we’ve gotten really, really good reception from retailers, particularly the drug class trait. Next up, men, this is TROJAN condoms, wait for it. Men wants to ensure their partner is satisfied. So we got a new product called G SPOT from TROJAN and we have an ad for you. Take a look. [Commercials] We always have a lot of fun with that TROJAN brand. By the way, whenever we have a meeting for new products, it’s the most – for TROJAN, it’s the most well-attended meeting in the company, if you look people sitting on the window sills. All right. VMS, so vitamin. We have lots of line extensions coming in 2020, and we are addressing a lot more need states. And we’ve really picked up pace of innovation for vitamins. If you look at 2017 and 2018, we kind of averaged six new items a year. We had 22 new items in 2019. We’ve got 17 more coming in 2020. Too many to run through today. And we have more innovation coming in 2020 in other categories, so stay tuned. You’ll hear about those later in the year. And next up is Steve to tell you our fabulous international story. Come on up, Steve.
Steven Cugine: Thank you, Matt.
Matthew Farrell: All right.
Steven Cugine: Excellent. So I’m pleased to be here to share with you the fabulous international growth story. So, as Matt already talked about, the Evergreen target for international is 6% per year. In 2014, we delivered $535 million in sales. We finished 2019 at $756 million in sales. The important note here is that, we firmly believe that we’ve reached global scale. There isn’t a market that we’re not in today and where we can’t reach with ourselves through our existing subsidiary markets or through our GMG business. I think even more impressive than the size of the business is that we tripled the organic growth rate from roughly 3% to about 9%. So significant, the larger business tripling the growth rate. This is an important chart that we show every year, but there’s some new information here. Our Global Markets Group is now 33% of the total business. For the first time, it is the largest segment within the international business, followed by Canada, Europe, three countries, Mexico, and Australia. We have grown historically well above our Evergreen target of 6%. In 2019, we hit 9.2%, an outstanding year, and we leave the year with momentum delivering 10.6%. So we feel the wind at our back. Let’s break that down in a little more detail. Our subsidiary markets delivered 5.2% and our GMG business, a whopping 19.2%. Our subsidiaries are largely in developed markets. So 5.2% in developed markets is really outstanding performance. Our brands are healthy, whether they be in emerging markets or GMG or in our subsidiary markets. So we’re excited about the performance of both of these businesses. The GMG business is certainly an engine of growth for the division and for the company. Since 2014, when we initiated the start of our new growth strategy for international, this business has delivered 19% CAGR throughout its lifecycle. And again, 2019, we did 19.2%, lot of 19s in there. And it’s driven by our core brands. So we’re driving ARM & HAMMER, BATISTE, WATERPIK, VMS, OXICLEAN, STERIMAR, FEMFRESH and now FLAWLESS. We continue to invest in building capabilities around the world. As you know, year in year out, I’ve been up here talking about the investments that we’ve made in Southeast Asia and then talk about China. We continue to make incremental investments in China, Southeast Asia, Germany, fast-growing market for us in Europe and in Central America. We’ve taken the opportunity to localize the content that we give to consumers, because these brands need to show up differently market-by-markets, so they’re relevant. We’re investing, particularly last year and this year in technology, because Matt talked about speed of decision-making we feel is a differentiator for the company. That is also true in these very dynamic international markets. We invest a lot in our GMG distributor training and regulatory affairs. We want to make sure that our partners in particular markets know as much as we do. We provide them innovation, case studies. That share case studies. So they are an extension of our family, and we think that is unique to Church & Dwight. So we’re absolutely committed to 6% organic growth moving forward. We believe we have a runway for our existing brands. We have demonstrated our ability to grow acquired brands, WATERPIK, now FLAWLESS. Our GMG group will continue to post double-digit growth and we made investments in fast-growing markets that we think we can leverage. Because we feel that we have a scaled global business for the first time, we’re going to make a new commitment. And that commitment is not only organic growth, but we’re going to continue to expand operating margin year in and year out. We’re going to take a big step change from 2019 to 2020. And part of our Evergreen target is to deliver another 50 bps of growth – of operating margin expansion. And that is on top of any incremental investments that we’re going to make to ensure that we have the capabilities around the world. So in summary, one, we have the right strategies for growth. We’ve demonstrated that, we know that. Two, we have brands that consumers love around the world. Three, we built a management team that is outstanding and several of them are around the world are here today. So to them, I say thank you. And we feel that we’re just starting. But there is a lot of runway in international markets for Church & Dwight’s products. Dropped the mic.
Matthew Farrell: That was another balloon for you at home.
Steven Cugine: I see.
A - Matthew Farrell: Wow, that was perfect punctuation mark. Okay, animal punctuation. So back to the algorithm – 3% algorithm, 2% U.S., 6% international and 5% for Specialty Products. Where is the 5% going to come from? Well, we have a bulk chemicals business, which is bulk sodium bicarbonate and then animal productivity, 6%. How has that been working out for you? Not very well. Well, let’s talk about why is that. So this one goes – flow on this. When you look at the top of the chart, that’s Specialty Products Division organic sales growth since 2011. So what do you notice? We’re up in 2011, down in 2012 and 2013. Up in 2014, 22.6%, down in 2015 and 2016, up in 2017, down 2018 and 2019, back up in 2020. And then below it, you say, “Okay, what was going on with milk prices.” And you can see, as milk prices recover, that’s when you see a green for the growth at a Specialty Products business. So we knew that a few years ago, 2015, we said, “Hey, we’ve got to start moving into other species.” And in 2015, 99% of the animal productivity business was dairy. And today, that’s not true. It was 1% non-dairy. Today, it’s 27% non-dairy. So we think that we’re going to be able to flatten this out over time. Now, why do we go into other species? Well, because of demand for protein and simply population growth. We have 7.7 people – 7.7 billion people today going to 9.8 billion by the middle of the century. And antibiotics are out of favor. And the consumers are telling retailers and farmers, “Hey, no antibiotics, no hormones, no chemicals.” And if you look at the stats, you see that there’s a 40% decrease in the use of animal probiotics since 2015. So that bodes well for us, because we bought two businesses. One was called VI-COR, the other was Agro BioSciences. They get us into prebiotics and custom probiotics. We were in nutritional supplements for dairy. We then got into prebiotics and probiotics. So now we have a nice portfolio for not only dairy, but cows, swine and poultry. So as I said before, the non-dairy business is 27% of animal productivity. Today, we think that’s going to have big growth in 2020. And we get lots of questions about milk. Hey, people raise their hands. Isn’t milk consumption in the United States on decline? Absolutely. So if you look at this chart here, the per capita consumption of 2015 was 174 pounds annually. More recently, it’s 164 pounds. But if you look what’s going on with cheese, big offset to that. It takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound cheese. And then when you comes to the Church & Dwight Conferences, you always walk away learning something you didn’t know. So when you think about milk, also think cheese. Cheese is a big offset for the decline in milk production. So the dairy industry does have growth ahead of it. So we feel good long-term about our algorithm of 5%. We have the trusted brand. The ARM & HAMMER brand goes across prebiotics, probiotics, all of our products. We are aligned with the consumer trend, we’re now into multiple species, and all the growth is ahead of us, particularly internationally. Right now, I want to talk about how we run the company. There’s five operating principles. One, we leverage brands. We have 12 brands that account for 80% of our revenues and profits. These are brands that consumers love. Second thing, we’ve long been a friend of the environment. And I’m going to go into it a little deeper in a moment, and we leverage people. We have highly productive people in an environment, where people do matter. And finally, we’re asset-light. We leverage our assets. Now if you do those four things well, you’re going to have really good returns. But because one of our competencies is identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses, we turn our good returns into great returns. As I said, here are the brands. We have brands consumers love. As far as the friend of the environment goes, over 100 years ago, we started using recycled paperboard in our cartons. In the 1970s, we were the first and really only corporate sponsor for the first Earth Day. Actually 20 years later, in 1990, we’re still the only corporate sponsor of Earth Day, and we were the first to take phosphates out of laundry detergent. More recently, we’ve been more focused on green global electricity demand supply by renewable sources by wind and power. And we’ve been planting lots of trees with Arbor Day. And we all remember from fifth grade science, that trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and they turn into oxygen. All right. What are some of our goals. We want to reduce water and wastewater by 25% by 2022. We want to recycle more. We want it 75% by the end of this year. And finally, we want to be carbon-neutral. So 100% carbon-neutral by 2025, and that’s through having green electricity and also planting millions and millions of trees. So that’s our goal today. We’re at 60% carbon-neutral. What that means is, we offset 60% of the CO2 that we put into the atmosphere. Okay. And we’ve been getting some recognition for that as well. We’ve regularly show up on list of Barron’s, Forbes, the EPA list of companies that are faithful to the environment. All right. Now I’d just also mention highly productive people in a place where people matter. This is the statistic that is interesting. This is revenue per employee. So you can see, we’re on the far right. We’re over 900,000 right now on our way to $1 million per employee. And you can see where our peers are. We think this is very representative of how lean the company is. And the thing that most people can’t tell about any company we invest in is, what is the culture. And the culture in our company is as follows. And we talk about this both inside and outside the company. It’s blue collar, high aptitude, underdogs. We’re digitally savvy, we embrace diversity and we like taking risks. And because we – that is the environment within our company. And you can’t just snap your fingers, flip a light switch and create that. I didn’t create that. That’s been there for many, many years. It’s the greatest asset of the company. And I think that’s one of the reasons why we’re so successful year-after-year-after-year. Now, we have tremendous financial literacy within the company. Most companies will focus on revenue and EPS. We also focus on gross margin. And that’s 25% of everyone’s annual bonus. And when it’s in your bonus, you ask questions like, “Hey, what’s gross margin? And how can we get it, because it affects me.” And it’s – so how we get it is, we have a Good to Great program, that’s our continuous improvement program. We’re continually optimizing our plants, new products are launched with higher gross margins than the products they replace. And when we buy businesses, we make them better. We expand the gross margins of businesses that we acquire. We have very simple compensation structure. You can see on the left side of the pie, net revenue and EPS. On the right side, we focus on gross margin, which is uncommon, as a metric within incentive compensation program. And cash from operations, we’ve long described ourselves as free cash flow junkies and we still are. All right. I’m going bring up Rick to talk about financials now.
Rick Dierker: All right. Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon. So we’re going to go through three things. We’re going to go through the 2019 results for the quarter, for the full-year and then go through the outlook. And before we do that, we’ll just start with Evergreen model, we – because we always do. 3% top line growth and 8% EPS growth. And then the drill down for that is 2% organic net sales growth, 25 basis points of gross margin expansion, flat on marketing as a percent, higher dollars typically with revenue growth. We leverage SG&A and we get to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and then 8% EPS growth. So that’s the backdrop. So how did we do? In Q4, you heard from Matt already, you saw in the release this morning, 4.4% organic revenue growth. Domestic was 3.5%, international was 10.5% and SPD for the first time in eight quarters with positive organic growth, which is great. Adjusted gross margin was 170 basis points up. I’ll walk through the detail of that in a minute. Marketing was up 240 basis points. So that’s the highest spend rate we’ve had in 2019. Just $37 million more year-over-year. It’s a very significant increase. SG&A was up largely because of the acquisition. Our TSA agreement as well as the amortization with that deal. Adjusted EPS was $0.55 versus the $0.54 outlook. So, on a revenue basis, the quarter was very strong, 4.4% and it was very strong even versus a strong year ago, 4.3%. So on a stacked basis, 8.7%. If you run your eyes across the page, 4.5% in the first quarter, 4.9% in the second, 3.5%, 4.4% and then 4.4% for the year. So for the full-year, like I said, 4.4% domestic has a 4% in front of it, that’s fantastic. As Britta said, 10 of 12 power brands grew share during the year. Internationally, just heard from Steve, 9% is a great number and then SPD was minus 3%. Gross margin was up 110 basis points. I’ll go through the detail gross margin in other slide. Marketing was up 10 basis points, that’s greater than our outlook. And then adjusted SG&A was also up for the same reasons I talked about in the quarter. EPS was up 9% to $2.47 and cash from operations was up to $865 million, up 16% year-over-year, just a fantastic result, higher cash earnings and improved working capital, which leads to free cash flow conversion of 128%, which is industry-leading, and we have a slide on that. So gross margin, just to walk you through the puts and takes. In Q4, plus 60 basis points, so that’s really the – we continue to get the benefit from price, as well as higher volumes. Inflation is a 50 basis point drag for the quarter, that has moderated a little bit since earlier in the year. Productivity programs are up 110 basis points. It’s been pretty consistent for the whole year. And then acquisition, so there’s two parts of the acquisition, 50 basis points from owning FLAWLESS, 10 basis points is because they have a slightly higher gross margin in the company. The other 40 basis points is acquisition accounting. Remember we took that the revenue minus COGS, minus marketing, marketing profit, that’s one line in net sales from the period of May through October. And so when there is no offset, it’s a pure margin. So gross margin expansion on a reported basis is 170 basis point. And then on a comparable basis, it would be 130 basis points. So that’s the quarter. And for the full-year, many of the same things apply and comparable gross margin expansion is plus 70 basis points. So just a fantastic year. We raised gross margin, I think, three times throughout the year. So on to 2020. So 6.5% reported sales growth, that’s larger than 3.5% for organic plus the FLAWLESS impact. Domestic is a 3%, international 7% and SPD is 3%, that’s our outlook for this year for the division. Gross margin is up 10 basis points. If you exclude or if you make 2019 comparable with the excluding the FLAWLESS accounting, we’re up 50 basis points apples-to-apples. Marketing is up 10 basis points. Again, we’re investing incrementally behind these brands and behind these big launches you see on the table today, as well as FLAWLESS. SG&A, we’re going to leverage by 10 basis points and operating margin on a reported basis is up 10 basis points, but apples-to-apples, up 50 basis points. The effective tax rate is 21%. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 21%, for 2019, it was slightly below 21% and for 2020, we think it’s 21%. What does that mean? It means all of our EPS growth is largely the operating income growth. EPS range from 7% to 9%, mid-point is 8% and then cash from ops is $890 million. So, as Matt talked about this year as a record, we would have a new record for next year. Okay. So here are some details on the outlook. We start with our 8% Evergreen model, 8% plus 2% accretion for FLAWLESS. Tariffs is a minus 1% drag. We’re getting a hit with tariffs 4B hitting FLAWLESS and our showerhead business to the tune of a drag of about 1% on EPS. Marketing investments for the new launch, that’s the 10 basis points you guys saw on the earlier page. And so that’s how we get to the mid-point of 7% to 9% and 8%. We focused on gross margin for a long, long time, it’s a hallmark of this company. Gross margin, as Matt said, is in everyone’s bonus. Gross margin drives cash flow, cash flow drives valuation. So we had an inflection point of 44.4% in 2018, we recovered nicely in 2019 and we’re going to continue to improve in 2020. So in 2020, here are the details. Plus 80 basis points as we continue to get some benefits carryover from price and as well as higher volume. Inflation continues to be a drag of 150 basis point, that’s largely pretty much across the Board from a commodity perspective. I would say, commodities were flat to up, slightly up. Some examples for you, ethylene is up mid single digits, clay is up high single digits, we have PCR, resin as an example, which is high, up significantly. HDPE resin is flat. So we have some headwinds on inflation, tariffs are in that – is in that number as well. Productivity programs are up 120 basis points, just getting very, very consistent with that. We’ve done some great work on the supply chain. And then the acquisition kind of making that apples-to-apples again shows you how gross margin on a reported basis is plus 10 basis points, but plus 50 basis points when you say it’s comparable. Matt showed this slide earlier, organic sales growth, 10-year trend, 3.5%, which is fantastic. In 2020, our expectations are no different. 2019 was the first time since 2015 that we had a 3.5% outlook. And so we’re proud to say that we’re doing that, again, despite the pullback on private label and getting out of private label vitamins and a little bit of OXICLEAN laundry high promotion. Okay. So just as important as volume, I mean, organic revenue growth is how we get there, right? So for the last 10 years, organic revenue growth was 3.5%, our volume growth on average is around 4%. You can see on the graph that we kind of inflected in 2019 and volume went down, right, and price mix went up. And our outlook for 2020, 3.5% organic revenue growth, about 50-50 is going to come from volume versus price mix. Then marketing spend again is up 10 basis points. We’re one of the top 20 advertisers within CPG. So we just have a significant amount of firepower here that we put to use for our brands. And then SG&A, on a reported basis, it looks like it’s gone up for the last few years. But when you strip out the acquisition, amortization, it’s actually very flattish. So we’re just really proud of this and 2020 is going to be no different. We expect to improve and leverage SG&A in 2020. We’ve had consistent strong adjusted EPS growth, so high single-digit, double digits with tax reform and again, high single-digit in 2019 and 2020. So our range is 7% to 9%, mid-point is 8%, the peer average is about 1% to 2%. This is my favorite Slide, best-in-class free cash flow conversion. We spend a lot of time on this, because we believe cash flow drives value and Church & Dwight in 2018 was 124% free cash flow conversion, that’s free cash flow divided by net income, the peer average was 85%, a lot of companies target 90%. Here is a new slide for you. Here’s our history over time. 125% in 2015, 130% in 2016, 123% in 2017, 124% in 2018 and 128% is what we just finished out in 2019. Our outlook for 2020 is 119%. So we just believe this is what sets us apart from our peer group to play in the 80s, 90s or close to 100. And how do we do that? Well, we do it a couple of different ways. One is really strong cash earnings. The second one is our improvement in working capital, cash conversion cycle. We’ve gone from 52 days in 2009 all the way down to 18 days in 2020. If you strip out the last two acquisitions we’ve done, this shows you how good we’re doing it at really moving the needle in working capital, trying to get down to zero. That’s still a goal. So we’ve gone – if you strip those two out, we’re at seven days today. Our baseline changes, because we’ve added these two new businesses that have a Chinese supply chain. So now we start off at 18 and we’ll continue to work through that number. But you’re going to see that we had great working capital improvement in 2019 and we expect no different in 2020. And we have a very strong balance sheet. We ended the year, less than 2 times levered, 1.9 times, we expect by the end of 2020 to be about 1.5 times. We have significant financial capacity, right? When you’re 1.5 times levered by the end of the year, you have the ability to do deals. Our prioritized uses of free cash flow has been the same for many years. Number one is TSR-accretive M&A. Number two is TSR-accretive M&A, but debt reduction is number two, and that’s where we’re going to use the cash for this year. Number three is NPD, number four is CapEx for organic growth, and then number five is dividends or buybacks. We’re not a capital-intensive company. We’re bumping up about $90 million next year and that’s still less than 2% of sales. We have a great dividend increase in 2020, it’s 5.5%. This is 119 years consecutively paying a dividend And then here is a new slide for you. Over the last three years, our average in the peer group for dividend annual growth rate was 8% and that’s the top tier of all of our peer set. And so with that, I’ll invite the management team up and we’ll answer any questions.
Operator:
A - Matthew Farrell: Well, all the hands are up, hands not even up here yet. Okay, Nik.
Nik Modi: I finally beat someone taller than me. So I guess, two questions. I remember, I don’t know, maybe it was 10 years ago, seven years ago, compaction was a pretty big deal for Church & Dwight from a margin perspective. So I was hoping to get some perspective from you on the new product launch and what that means for shipping costs and just packaging costs and how you think about that? And then the second is, when it comes to FLAWLESS, I know there’s kind of conflict right between the As Seen on TV and the merchandising aspect. And so just thinking longer-term, is there a plan to like completely migrate this to a in-store and digital and online product where you don’t have that comp, because you guys have really execution, merchandising, display activity. So just – was hoping to get some clarity on the long-term plan there?
Matthew Farrell: Well, I’ll take that one first. Yes, I mean the plan for FLAWLESS system migrated from As Seen on TV brand and completely into the wet shave aisle and completely vacate that part of the store. Because in a lot of stores, it’s not in a very attractive place. So if you look at one major retailers by automotive. But when we bought it, we said no, this is a brand that’s going to have legs at long-term and it belongs to wet shave aisle. And one major retailer is getting behind it right now. So over time, that’s what you’re going to see happening. It’s happening right now in 2020. Your other question was about compaction. So when compaction happen, there is one major retailer that drove that many, many years ago, that’s not on the horizon right now for the industry. I mean, right now, one would argue that the biggest form of compaction is pods. So that pods at some point – if pods at some point plateaus, I think, it’s possible then we would go back to, it may be a major compaction for liquid laundry detergent, but that is clear enough on horizon right now. Were you asking the question about that new product…
Nik Modi: Yes.
Matthew Farrell: …that we have online. I’ll let Britta take a swing at that one and what the insight was around that.
Britta Bomhard: So I think you’re talking about the product I showed, that’s an e-commerce play, right? So it’s not in mass distribution, because I think I’ve said that, and you’ve seen our ambition to grow on the online class of trade, because that’s where all the consumers go and a lot of shopping happens. And currently, there is not a good loan resolution there. And that’s why we’ve developed this specific product for that class of trade, and we’re seeing phenomenal results.
Nik Modi: Great. Thank you.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Bill?
Bill Chappell: Yes. Sticking on the laundry side, maybe first on CLEAN & SIMPLE. Can you give us a little more color. Is this incremental shelf space? How cannibalistic do you expect it to be? And then also, I mean – and maybe it’s in the plans, there is not a pod form coming out, I guess on the initial launch. Well, it seems that Tide is coming at you with the Tide Simply version of pods. So maybe the thought behind that of is, are you seeing pods in your category start to level out where it’s not as important? Do you not see this as big of a threat? So any more color both around what the shelf space looks like and how you expect this to interact with the core brand and then also just from the pod standpoint, the competitive launch?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. So CLEAN – I’ll let Paul comment at some point, but CLEAN & SIMPLE, whenever you launch a new product in liquid laundry under the ARM & HAMMER brand, you’re going to have some cannibalization. But this one there will be some cannibalization, but net, it will be incremental to us and we think as well to the category. As far as, are we going to move into pods for CLEAN & SIMPLE, we wouldn’t disclose what our plans might be with respect to the CLEAN & SIMPLE as a platform. Could it happen? Absolutely. Bill, I’ll let Paul comment as well some retailer reception to CLEAN & SIMPLE.
Paul Wood: Yes. I’ll be a little guarded just in the message, more for competitive reasons than I’m to avoid your question. But what I would tell you is, with every launch, we are going to have that cannibalization where you have the incrementality, absolutely. This one is a little different though, the story on this one of everything Britta showed in the marketing and the timing, what the consumers are looking for in the health and wellness front, just the other trends going on, makes us a very interesting story as you’re pitching it to get incremental space, different space, display space, other things in the store. I would tell you, it’s happening as we speak right now, the resets, so I don’t want to give away what others are doing. But I’d encourage you the next couple of weeks to get out to a retail, loved to have retail with you and show you firsthand. This one is a little different. I would also tell you on the insights front, we believe this isn’t just looking at the consumer within our set today buying another yellow bottle. This is going to get some attention on shelf from maybe you’re not buying it today. This is going to bring you in, the CLEAN & SIMPLE, the marketing grid has got behind it. You just saw fraction of it today. In the shopper marketing we’re doing with retailer is going to be a little special. So I’m excited, I’m going to temper my vocabulary here, but love to talk to you more on this one.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Rupesh?
Rupesh Parikh: So I guess, just my first question with FLAWLESS, just curious what drove the shortfall in Q4. And as you look to this year, just want to get a sense, it seems like distribution is driving all the growth, just wanted to get a sense of velocity, the contributor. And then, also do you expect any inventory adjustments?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. So in the fourth quarter, we were down year-over-year. So business was $180 million in 2018, it was $186 million in 2019. We bought the business, we thought it would be higher by the end of the year. We know why – a couple of things we disclosed. We had an issue with one large retailer, Bed Bath & Beyond and we also delayed a launch into 2020. Now as far as the consumption goes, consumption was down significantly in the fourth quarter. We expect that to continue, but to start to recover in the first quarter. And by the time we get to the second quarter, we’re in the new launch and also the new distribution, we expect consumption in measured channels, because measured channels in this – for this category is less than 50%. But you’ll start to see in measured channels a year-over-year increase. And we think it’s going to build from Q2, Q3 and Q4. So I think a lot of the growth is ahead of us starting in Q2 as a result of the NU RAZOR.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I would just add to that. From an organic growth perspective, right, we’re calling 50 basis points for tailwinds from FLAWLESS. In Q1, we think it will be flat to slightly down, and – but pretty much 90 basis points to 100 basis points of tailwind in the second-half and that’s how you get to the 50 basis points for the full-year for organic.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then…
Matthew Farrell: Do you have another one, Rupesh?
Rupesh Parikh: Yes. One quick one. So just in your guidance, what are you assuming for the promotional environment?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. So on the promotional environment, we’ve talked about every quarter, and as many of you know the promotional environment generally talking about the household side of the house and not a personal care. And when we say household, it’s about laundry and we’re talking about litter. I’ll take litter first. The litter category is pretty tame right now as far as the promotional environment. So if you look at sequentially, it was pretty much flattish and even year-over-year, there is no story there. So we think it’s steady as you go in litter. I think you got to keep in mind is that, in the litter category these hard fought price increases, it’s unlikely that the suppliers are going to want to deal that, that the hard one increased back to the consumers. So I wouldn’t expect that to change in 2020. Laundry, same story. I mean, Q4 was our lowest quarter of the year, 25% sold on deal. And the category was 35%. And liquid laundry, little bit higher, it was 37% sold on deal. But two big suppliers would be Church & Dwight and Henkel both down sequentially from Q2, -- pardon me, Q3 to Q4. And Procter was up, it kind of filled the void in the promotional space. We expect that to continue in 2020. Okay. Your next. Yes.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Thank you. Just on the – sorry, 3.5% organic growth, like and you’re exiting that you said is now out of the vitamin. So the vitamin business in private label, is that going to be – I’m assuming that growth was more dilutive to your growth or – it was actually growing faster. So that 3.5% on a more continuing space is like a 4%, or is not – is small relative to make – to move the needle?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. I’ll take a swing at this and then Rick can jump in. Yes. So we call it 3.5% for 2020. Our run rate in the second-half of 2019 as a company is 4%. We’ve said, hey, that’s going to accelerate by 50 basis points, because of FLAWLESS from 4% to 4.5%. So we have 100 basis points go in other way for two reasons. One, exiting private label vitamins and number two, we’re continuing to pull back on OXICLEAN promotions. Now with that 100 basis points, the lion’s share of that is the vitamin business. We have stepped up our innovation over the last couple of years in vitamins. If you saw the Slide that we had earlier, you’ll see – if you went back to 2016 and 2017, we had like six new launches a year, 2018 – from 2019, we had 22 new launches and next we’re going to have 17 new launches. So – but this is the right time to exit our private label, it came into the company with the acquisition and it’s lower margin and we think it’s fine.
Rick Dierker: Yes. I would just add, that business was flattish, the private label business for vitamins, it wasn’t declining or anything like that. We just felt that, that wasn’t the right strategic choice for the company. So we decided to proactively get out of it.
Rupesh Parikh: And that is I think – that is accretive to margins, If I assuming right on exiting, to end that business or that’s not?
Rick Dierker: It’s – when you think about the scale and the size of that business, right, where – if we give you a sense of it, if we’re saying 100 basis points is going down for those two things, maybe two-thirds of that is the private label and one-third of that is the laundry stuff. So, any impact on margin is pretty minimal.
Rupesh Parikh: And following up on Bill’s question, if I may, on the CLEAN & SIMPLE, is that a margin accretive innovation or in the meantime you might have – like, what is the price point that you’re positioning at this point?
Matthew Farrell: Hey, Paul, do you want to take a swing at the price points?
Paul Wood: Yes. So the price points, this is going to be right in line with our existing lineup. So just as Britta was talking about the efficacy and it being equal, that’s how it will show up for shelf as well. And that’s a really big message that our retailers really resonated with them that it was going to be line-priced.
Rick Dierker: And then from a margin basis, we wouldn’t really say much, but it’s at brand average. Year one we have, of course, cost to drive volume for incrementality.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Joe?
Joe Altobello: Thanks. Just wanted to get a bit more color on the increase in marketing spend, obviously a big in the fourth quarter, and it sounds like you’re looking for about a 1 point of headwind on EPS growth in 2020. What’s driving the increase? Is it bigger new launches and what particular brands is it going behind and are you shifting dollars away from promo into marketing?
Matthew Farrell: Is the question with respect to fourth quarter?
Joe Altobello: Fourth quarter and 2020 as well?
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Well, fourth quarter, we could see what was coming and we are doing well on top line and gross margin. So we have a chance to reinvest both in marketing and in SG&A. We call that all places we invested in SG&A. So obviously, we’re able to throw a lot of money behind on the brands. That – and that always helps you going into the new year. As your question about 2020, is the 10 basis points uptick?
Joe Altobello: Yes. More so that the 1 point of EPS headwind that you’re expecting to from launches?
Rick Dierker: The 10 basis points does represent the 1% EPS drag and it’s really for the new launches, right. The one on the table, we’ll really get behind that in a big way. The NU RAZOR for FLAWLESS get behind that in a big way. And then maybe, Britta, if you want to talk about.
Britta Bomhard: Yes. So we have a couple of exciting product, as you saw. So, for example, BATISTE foam, we are category leader and as you’ve seen, there is a huge household penetration opportunity, it’s also a new hair type. So we’re going to spend some money on educating consumers about a new way, particularly women with curly and dry hair.
Matthew Farrell: And maybe one more I had, I just thought of is, we showed you household penetration for WATERPIK in the U.S. versus internationally, and we found that it’s very responsive to advertising. And so now we’re going to start rolling that out in Europe and Canada and Australia. So that marketing investment is happening globally as well.
Joe Altobello: And just one for Steve. The increase in operating margin for international this year is pretty big. Is that coming from sales leverage among other things or cost savings programs? What’s driving that?
Steven Cugine: Yes. So I think there’s a couple of things. We had some expense in the year that we’re not going to recover. We feel like we’ve made investments on top of that, that we’re not going to repeat again in next year. I would say, that’s a large part of that and there is some mix as well.
Joe Altobello: Okay. Thanks.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Steve?
Stephen Powers: Okay. I do have a question for Steve. But something Rick said earlier prompted another question. Why would FLAWLESS have any impact on organic regardless of what it does in the first quarter, given that you didn’t owner it a year ago?
Rick Dierker: It doesn’t. I was trying to give you a sense that on a reported basis in Q1, that it could be flat to down. The organic impact is 50 basis points for the full-year. All of that’s in the second-half, around 100 basis points.
Stephen Powers: Okay, perfect. And then internationally, maybe you could get a lot going on, but maybe you could rank order, the growth initiatives you have on top three, whether you think about it by brand, by geography or by category? And then as you think forward with the commitments or margin expansion as an evergreen, does that inhibit your ability to kind of press on growth as you have been or should we expect some deceleration back down toward that Evergreen’s six-ish level?
Steven Cugine: No, we feel really confident, I mean we see the business accelerating as you saw in 2019, and we see that continuing into 2020, again with less requirement for investments. Because we think we have the right kind of staffing level in each one of the regions, China was a big investment over the last couple of years, as we’ve built our own team in China plus we spent money on slotting, getting product into that market. So we think all of that, whether it would be Latin America, which has been growing very nicely for us and in Asia-Pac, whether it would be China or Southeast Asia, we’ve made a lot of investments in the past. And now we think we can reap the benefits of continued strong organic growth without those investments repeating. That’s just – that’s why we feel, so confident that we can continue to deliver on the operating margin, because we’re going to get leverage in the P&L. So we’re going to get that on marketing and we’re going to get that on SG&A, for sure.
Stephen Powers: It is the growth investment skewed anywhere, I mean are you more excited about emerging markets about...
Steven Cugine: You know it’s a funny thing, and [indiscernible] is here. He runs our GMG business and he would say this year, we had strong growth in EMEA and in Latin America. Latin America is smaller for us, but fast growing. We made those investments in China, we saw very strong China growth in 2019 and we expect strong growth in Southeast Asia as well. Asia, in particular, we see is real growth engine long-term for the company, because we’re just still young and small, but growing fast.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Swing to this side of the table, Kevin?
Kevin Grundy: All right. Kevin Grundy, Jefferies. I had a question on international as well. So it works out. So connecting the dots just to sort of pick up where you left off there, Steve, given that why the implied deceleration in the outlook for international and I don’t want to diminish 7%, which is outstanding. But you guys haven’t done a 7% in the past five years in the region and now you have a presence in China. So I’m just trying to to connect the dots with that. And then more broadly, maybe, Matt, you can chime in the role on M&A and how you potentially see that longer- and growing your international business. And lastly, from a capital planning perspective, when do certain markets you potentially consider moving them from the export model to the subsidiary model? What’s sort of like a tipping point? How do you think about that and implications from an income statement and from balance sheet perspective? Thanks.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. I’ll try to remember all that. Let’s start off with the current year. So, we have an algorithm of 6% annually. So we always go back to that, can we sustain 6% year-after-year-after-year. And if you look at what Steve has been doing in international is hitting out of the park. And so, now we got a big plan for this year, you might say you’re sad because it’s not 9%, but we’re not a company that’s going to get way out over our skis. So we think we got a strong plan for 2020. We don’t view that as a deceleration, we look at that as we’re consistently now delivering above our algorithm. You asked the question about international. So we have done some M&A internationally over the past few years. Viviscal was a – is an international brand. Our WATERPIK had some international as well. We bought the ANUSOL brand from J&J. And so we’re putting a lot of effort behind those and we get a lot of traction. So Steve and his gang have done a great job, taking those two to international markets. So we’re continually scanning for things that we can acquire, and we can put into our infrastructure and leverage it. But we’re pretty fussy about what we’re going to buy. And as you know, you had a third one though, the third question.
Kevin Grundy: Yes, when does it tip to go direct?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Okay, I’ll go – Steve can say what we’ve done in Germany.
Steven Cugine: Yes. So we look at markets where we can go direct and it really is all about SG&A leverage. So how concentrated is the retail environment. And in Germany, it’s quite concentrated. So, we were able to go direct in Germany and manage that P&L, so we get returns fast. My two buddies down here, they’re pretty disciplined about spending and returns, as you can imagine. So you really need like a 20 to 1 relationship in terms of SG&A investment to sales growth. And so where the markets are young and highly fragmented from a retail environment, it takes a lot more SG&A to make that happen. So we know the underlying economic model for us, what we need to have to shift from an export market to a subsidiary market. And we’ll make those calls as we see fit, but that is not required for us to hit our evergreen target.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. All right. Same table, Jason.
Jason English: Good afternoon, and thank you. Two very different topics for questions. First, sticking on international, but with a supply chain angle. Can you update us on the status of tariffs on your supply chain and also whether or not we should be considering any risk related to the coronavirus in terms of supply and manufacturing of – whether it’d be the WATERPIK or I’m not sure where FLAWLESS is manufactured whether we should be cognizant of that as well? Second is on private label. Could you size of 100 bps drag, how much of it is from the private label exit, any reason to think that may actually suck some capacity out of the industry and help your branded side? And is there also maybe on the other side of that, risk presumably a good time to exit would have been five years ago when you’re spending a lot of money to add capacity, I imagine you chose not to, because of, there was a risk tethered to it. If assuming that’s the case then why is that there no longer that risk?
Matthew Farrell: I’ll start with China. So we’re well aware of what’s going on in China, right now with the virus. So we have checked with our suppliers of both of finished products and also business like FLAWLESS and SPINBRUSH and WATERPIK. And right now, it looks like because of the extension of the Chinese New Year, there is going to be a one, maybe two-week delay in startup of those manufacturing sites. But because of our safety stock what’s on the water and also, you can overcome some of delay like that with air freight, that we don’t see a risk right now with what we know right now to quarter call that’s in the – it’s in the release. Good on that one?
Steven Cugine: Yes. And then on tariffs I would I try to talk about in my prepared remarks, a little bit. But that 1% drag on EPS is tariffs that’s really the four B list that went into effect on December 15, and we’re getting hit on showerheads and FLAWLESS. So you can do the math on what about 1% EPS drag is, but it’s a couple of cents. And then your other question on private label vitamins of 100 basis points decline in organic growth, I had said about 60% is piece of the private-label vitamin beginning to exit, right? It’s a two-year process. So 50 bps of the 100 bps is from private-label vitamins. And I don’t know, Rick, if you want to say anything else about the supply chain in China or are you good?
Rick Dierker: Yes. Matt pretty much covered it. We’re working very closely with our suppliers. And what we know so far is the one to two-week delay that Matt referenced on starting up after Chinese New Year. We have ample safety stock don’t anticipate a material impact to Q1, but it’s something we’ll continue to monitor on a regular basis.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. All right. Okay. You’ve been waving your hand for a while.
Stephen Powers: Thanks, Matt. Wanted to talk about two different categories and just state of competition in laundry and cat litter, and then also your expectations for fiscal ‘20 between volume versus price mix?
Matthew Farrell: I couldn’t hear the very first part of it.
Stephen Powers: Laundry and cat litter, the state of competition.
Matthew Farrell: Oh, the state of competition in the laundry and litter category? Okay. Well, I mean you saw the chart with respect to shares in laundry. We had a great year in laundry. ARM & HAMMER was up. XTRA, for the first time in a longtime held share up a little bit. And OXICLEAN, we lost some share, but that was as not as expected because we pulled back on promotions. You also saw from the chart the dynamics over the last three years, but who is winning and who is struggling. We think we have an unfair competitive advantage in the laundry detergent, because we have a value brand, that’s advertised, which is ARM & HAMMER. And ARM & HAMMER is $1 billion brand if you go across all of our categories. And actually we’ve done a wonderful job in positioning that product against Sun over the last couple of years and we continue to win distribution. So we’ve got a long-term plan and we aim to be the number two supplier of laundry detergent at some point. In the litter category, litter is a function of innovation and we have been the innovator in that category for many, many years. And we think that over time that is going to bode well for us as far as growing share in the future. I commented earlier about the promotional environment, it is pretty much – pretty tepid, I would say, in both categories. I don’t expect that to change in litter as we said, because we’re not going to deal back your price increases. And I do think that the reduction in the amount sold on deal in the laundry category is really de facto price increase, we want list price increases in laundry. But the pull back in promotions as a group over time is de facto an increase in price and it improves margins.
Steven Cugine: And Matt, if you want me talk about just how we advertise Oxi Laundry and what’s this done to the additives category?
Matthew Farrell: You can do that.
Steven Cugine: Well, sometimes myopically we just look at, Oxi Laundry is down a little bit in share, but we really didn’t take a broader brush and say since we launched OXICLEAN laundry, we’ve gone from a 42 share in additive to 56 share in additives. So we’re really happy with our OXICLEAN megabrand.
Matthew Farrell: I hope everybody paid attention to that. So if you go back and say, wow, OXICLEAN launched into premium laundry detergent and we’re sad because it didn’t work out. No. So in stain fighters, we had a 42% market share when we launched OXICLEAN over in liquid laundry, it went from 42% to 56% today. So all that effort paid off, and so we’re making a lot more money today. So that brand is alive and well.
Britta Bomhard: Can I add something. So you see…
Matthew Farrell: Let’s pile on here. This is good.
Britta Bomhard: Sorry?
Matthew Farrell: Let’s pile on.
Britta Bomhard: Yes, well, I love that brand. So I have to talk about brands. And I think you’ve seen the more power to you and what it does for us. We now have a similar and that’s work your magic on OXICLEAN, which is equally working extremely well across the different components of OXICLEAN. So if we have several very clear evidence the lifts after we advertise and then it’s across the different sub-segments of OXICLEAN as well. So I’m very confident, positive that OXICLEAN is a very, very strong brand and we continue to grow.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. All right. It looks like we might be done. Hey, I want to thank everybody for coming today. We had great questions and looking forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead sir.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll provide a few comments on the quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO, when Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions. Q3 was an outstanding quarter for our company. We delivered higher than expected 3.6% organic sales growth. We had gross margin expansion from the base business and 13.8% adjusted EPS growth. And as you saw in the release, we exceeded our outlook by $0.06, partially due to a $0.03 retroactive tariff exemption. In the U.S., organic sales grew 3.3%. Our categories are growing. Our market shares were healthy as evidenced by nine of our 12 power brands grew or held share and majority of our power brands grew market share. And in most cases this was achieved while reducing our promotional activity. We continue to have success in the online class of trade. Online sales grew 30% this quarter. We expect 2019 full year online sales to exceed 8% compared to 7% in 2018. And many of our power brands continued to be number one on Amazon. Our international consumer business turned in another excellent quarter with 8.7% organic growth. The standouts in Q3 were Australia, Mexico, Germany and our Global Markets Group, which we formerly referred to as our export business. The Global Markets Group grew 13.7% in Q3 and has been an outstanding contributor to our international growth. And it is noteworthy that approximately 90% of the GMG growth over the past three years is driven by sales growth of existing distributors that balances new international markets that we have been entering. International is a perennial bright spot for Church & Dwight. Our long-term organic growth target for international is 6%. This business has averaged 8% organic growth from 2015 to 2018 and 2019 is shaping up to be another exceptional year. Now turning to Specialty Products. Q3 was another challenging quarter as organic sales declined 4.1%. Throughout 2019, we have seen lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers. Milk prices have been increasing for the past six months, which should bolster future demand for our products. We continue to be optimistic about our long-term 5% organic sales growth algorithm as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like poultry, cattle and swine. Let's go back to the U.S. consumer business for a minute and call out a couple of highlights in the quarter, laundry and dry shampoo. In the laundry category, which grew 2.2%, ARM & HAMMER laundry consumption was up 6.6% and gained 40 share points. XTRA liquid detergent consumption was up 2.9% and gained 10 share points. As anticipated the promotional environment in laundry continued to abate. We significantly reduced ARM & HAMMER laundry percentage sold on promotion by 580 basis points while maintaining growth. Our new laundry product, ARM & HAMMER FADE DEFENSE is doing well and continues to meet our expectations. In dry shampoo, BATISTE continues to gain share with 26% consumption growth more than double the category growth of 12.6%. BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 15th consecutive quarter. Now I'll make a few comments on our more recent acquisitions. Globally WATERPIK continues to show growth and it's the number one leader in the category with market shares in the high 90s. WATERPIK's year-to-date sales growth is 9%. The business is on track to deliver high single-digits growth. Internationally WATERPIK grew 35% in the quarter. We are replicating the launch-and-learn professional marketing program, which is used in the U.S. Big international opportunity is increasing household penetration. We estimate that roughly 22% of U.S. households use WATERPIK compared to 3% to 5% in Europe. We are also seeing growing demand for water flossers in Asia. Next is FLAWLESS. This is a business that we acquired in May of this year. In the first half of the year, FLAWLESS saw strong sales growth up 38% on a pro forma basis. In order to get to our 15% growth full year estimate, in the second half, we expected pro forma sales to be up slightly. This deceleration was expected because we were lapping the 2018 launch of the FLAWLESS brow product. Q3 was the second highest quarter ever for FLAWLESS. However, pro forma second half sales are down 10%, resulting in 6% full year pro forma sales growth. A couple of things happened. One important retail customer has been experiencing operating difficulties with a 7% lower same-store sales, which affected orders for our product. In addition, sales are lower because we decided to delay a new product launch until February 2020 to better coincide with planogram resets at several important retailers where we have had significant distribution wins. It's very important to our growth plans as we transition this business from being display-driven to an in-aisle brand. So based on distribution wins so far, we expect a 10% increase in our ACV in 2020 and we are very excited about the future of this brand and expect 2020 sales growth to exceed 15%. Regarding Q4, our year-to-date performance and the tariff exemption have afforded us the opportunity to reinvest in the business. We always manage Church & Dwight for the long run and it has been our long-standing practice to invest over-delivery of earnings back into the business. As you saw in the release, in Q4, we plan to invest in our Asia Pacific partnerships and are accelerating investments in R&D, predictive analytics supply chain and sustainability. So in conclusion, we had an excellent quarter. Organic sales growth is solid. Base gross margin is expanding and we're on track to exceed our evergreen business model in 2019. I'm going to turn it over to Rick right now for his comments on third quarter, fourth quarter and full year.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt, and good morning everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.66 per share, compared to $0.58 in 2018, up 13.8%. The $0.66 exceeded our outlook of $0.60. That is a $0.06 beat. We had a favorable ruling on the company's appeal of Tier two tariffs, which helped the quarter by $0.03. And the other $0.03 was $0.02 from business performance and $0.01 of marketing timing. Q3 reported EPS was $0.62. Adjusted EPS excludes the earnout adjustment for the FLAWLESS business. And as we discussed in previous calls, this quarterly adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earnout period. Reported revenue was up 5%, short of our approximately 6% outlook, largely due to the lower FLAWLESS sales and a currency drag. Organic sales were up 3.6% exceeding our Q3 outlook of approximately 3%. As Matt already covered the divisional performance, I'll spend a few moments on price mix and volume for the company. Organic sales increased by 3.6% as positive price and mix drove a 4.3% increase. This was slightly offset by a negative volume of 0.7%. Lower volumes resulted from lower promotional spending and the impact on volume from price increases. Historically, organic sales growth has been volume-driven. And while volumes have performed in line with or better than our expectations in response to the recent price increases, it has contributed less to growth over the last several quarters. In 2020 and beyond, we expect volume to be the primary driver of our growth. I'll now move to gross margin. Our third quarter gross margin was 46.6%, a 230 basis point increase from a year ago. This is 100 basis points better than our outlook, which is due to the tariff exception benefit. The full year net impact on gross margin related to tariffs in '19 is neutral. Moving now to marketing. Marketing was up $4.7 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 10 basis points to 11.5%. We continue to expect full year marketing as a percentage of net sales to be 11.7% or flat to 2018. For SG&A, Q3 reported SG&A increased 220 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the FLAWLESS earnout adjustment, SG&A increased 110 basis points, primarily due to intangible amortization, related to acquisitions. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A was up 7% in the quarter, as we continue to invest behind innovation. Adjusted net operating margin for the quarter was 21% or 130 basis points higher. Other expense was $16.2 million. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 21.6%, compared to 21.9% in 2018, a slight decrease of 30 basis points, primarily driven by a higher number of stock options exercised. And now to cash. For the first nine months of 2019, net cash from operating activities was $617 million, a $49.4 million increase from the prior year. And this higher cash earnings were partially offset by an increase in working capital. Our cash earnings are up 13% year-to-date versus a year ago. And through the first nine months of the year, our AR-factoring program is flat to prior year. We expect to see an increase in the program in Q4. During Q3, we repurchased 150 million shares to get ahead of our 2020 share creep and what we considered an attractive share price. For Q4, we expect adjusted EPS to be $0.54 as a result of our investments and higher tax rate. And now for the full year. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. We now expect reported sales growth of approximately 5%, previously 6%, partially due to the FLAWLESS integration starting November 1 versus October 1 as well as foreign currency. We're timing a system cutover until after peak seasonal orders and display building is finished. We now expect full year gross margin to expand 100 basis points or 60 basis points excluding the FLAWLESS acquisition accounting, which is an improvement. As I said earlier, the full year impact of tariffs on gross margin is neutral. We continue to expect full year adjusted operating margin to increase 50 basis points and we continue to expect 2019 adjusted EPS of $2.47 per share or adjusted EPS growth of 9%. As mentioned in the release, and as Matt commented, similar to prior years, we will be reinvesting the Q3 beat back into the business to continue our momentum. We listed the areas of investment in the release and as one example we're excited about how well Asia Pacific is doing. Remember that business was less than $10 million just a few years ago and now it's approaching $50 million. We will continue to invest incrementally where it makes sense. Lastly, I'd like to provide some additional details around the FLAWLESS accounting treatment during the transition period, May 1 to October 31. We decided to wait until November 1 to purchase FLAWLESS inventory in order to minimize any business disruption risk during peak seasonal shipment. During the transition period, net marketing profit received from Ideavillage is accounted for as other revenue as a component of net sales. So, for Q4, we'll have a month of October, reflecting marketing profit and the month of November and December reflecting net sales. And just a housekeeping note, when we provide our 2020 organic outlook, we will proforma 2019 results for FLAWLESS for the 7 months of ownership to enable investors the ability to assess on a consistent basis, our like-for-like revenue growth. And with that Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America, your question please.
Olivia Tong: Great. Good morning. Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about the balance between volume and price mix as we start to lap some of these initial pricing gains because your price is clearly holding up nicely, but the volume seems to be suffering a little bit. So does that concern you? And what does that look like going forward? And any change in your view on the makeup of organic sales growth as we go forward particularly in Consumer Domestic? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Good question. So we raised prices in eight categories, let's say five in household and three in personal care. So litter, stain fighters, carpet deodorizer, baking soda and also WATERPIK. I guess WATERPIK we throw over on the personal care side. Then dry shampoo, condoms and ORAJEL. So volumes have been better than expected for us throughout the year. Logical question is, okay when is the price mix going to turn positive for volume? And from our point of view, generally you have to wait a year for that to happen. For most categories -- most of our categories are need based and generally volume growth will return about one year after price increases.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I would just add Olivia. I think you heard in my comments in 2020 and beyond, we think we're going to be largely volume driven. As an example the domestic business in Q2 was minus 0.9% on volume. And in Q3 it was minus 1.8%. So it was sequentially worse. Now that's largely a cat litter story. And remember in Q2 on the call we said we expected our litter business to slow down a bit in the second half. We -- competition raised price earlier than we did so we got a little bit of a volume benefit in the second half. And so on a stack basis, we don't usually do this. But on a stack basis for sales litter in Q1 was 16. In Q2 it was closer to 12 so the first half averaged 13 and the stack basis for Q3 and Q4 is going to average actually 14. So the litter business is very strong, but that show up a little bit in volume in Q3.
Olivia Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then Nielsen, our scanner data has looked a little softer recently particularly as time has progressed. So laundry is still doing well, but many of your other categories like you mentioned litter are starting to see some softening. And I know you said, the second half/first half pricing phenomena. But can you talk about the major variations that you're seeing relative to scanner beyond that?
Rick Dierker: Yes sure. Our bridge from our organic number to Nielsen, Nielsen was around 1.7%. So that would be tracked channels. We were at 3.3%. That's a delta of 1.6. 2/3 of that is just on tracked channels. I think you read in the release or in Matt's comments online sales are up 30%, right? So that business continues to do really well. And then maybe 1/3 of that is lower coupons as we pull back on trade and laundry as an example we're also pulling back on couponing. So by and large, it's really just a comp issue for litter and then it's pull back for everything like laundry.
Olivia Tong: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your question please.
Kevin Grundy: I wanted to pick up on FLAWLESS. So Matt I guess what have been the learnings so far? The commentary was that it's going to come in a bit below expectations on the back half of the year due to some softer comps from a key customer and just some timing around innovation. But it sounds like you're still confident in the 15% sales growth for next year. But I guess the context is this asset is a little bit different and it's been passed along with WATERPIK. And it's less common as I can recall for an acquired business to miss plan at this early stage after an acquisition. So the questions would be do you think you have a full visibility on the reasons the business is underperforming at this point? How is it performing outside of that key customer? And then what gives you confidence that you can deliver 15% sales growth for the business looking out to next year?
Matt Farrell: Yes. The - look the second half one thing is out of our control, one thing is in our control. So it's out of our control. If you have an important retailer, historically the largest account having some operating difficulties in cutting orders that's just -- those things happen. What was in our control is, do we go forward with a new product launch broadly? And obviously making that decision to defer to next year was an obvious hit to our reported numbers, as well as the perception of investors with respect to the acquisition. So we deferred that until February 2020. The good news is that, we've been getting a lot of distribution wins that we know are coming. And when we see that the ACV is going to be up 10% next year and we're calling a 15% growth, we think it's on sound ground. Now the thing to keep in mind here too is that, this is a brand that's in transition. If you were a -- the brand is largely driven by displays and it's moving to be an in-aisle brand so that's a big transition. And remember that business wasn't set-up to manage a business that was an in-aisle brand. This -- and the other thing we're doing is we're building a brand. We start with a product and we're building a brand. And the way you build a brand is with marketing and with new product innovation and the business has a really good pipeline of innovation. So those are reasons why we say, hey we got a bit of a bump here going sideways in the second half but we feel good about the future.
Rick Dierker: And I just want to give context to the bump right? We're bringing the full year reported number down from 6% to 5%. Only one-third of that is -- so it's maybe 30 basis is because of this FLAWLESS miss in Q3. Then the one-third is just integration transition timing as we move it out a month. We didn't want to do all the inventory activity right when they're trying to ship out so we move that a month. That was worth one-third of it. And then one-third of it is FX. So it's one-third of 1% to give you context.
Kevin Grundy: Thanks, Rick. Just one follow-up on this and I'll pass it on. A bunch of question, but I'll pass it on. As the product does move from display to in aisle and then given, sort of, the newness of the brand to the company what, sort of, visibility do you have on velocity as you do that? So what gives you the confidence then as you make a shift which would be an important one given where this business is and how young it is and how young the brand is?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well we can tell from the previous launches and the excitement on the part of the consumer for the brand and the retailers recognize it as well. This brand does get younger consumers into the stores, which is definitely what many retailers are looking for. So we're not worried about velocity. We think that once we get really good placement distribution in aisle it's going to help the brand. It's going to be a big positive.
Kevin Grundy: Okay, I'll leave it there. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Cody Ross: Good morning, everyone. This is actually Cody on for Jason. Just wanted to dig into your gross margin guidance a little bit. You've guided gross margins to increase 100 bps or 60 six bps, excluding FLAWLESS. I believe your previous guide of 80 bps expansion included FLAWLESS suggesting you're increasing your gross margin expansion by about 20 basis points this quarter. Can you just provide the puts and takes of a higher GM outlook? Thank you. 
Rick Dierker: Yes, sure. No problem Cody. You're right. When we provided the 40 -- the 80 basis points for the full year last quarter about half of that was the base business and half of that was FLAWLESS. So 40 and 40. The FLAWLESS number is unchanged. It's still a 40. And then the 60 is the base business. So that's 100 for the full year now. If you just start with the 40 basis point outlook and then we add back the benefit of tariffs that's 25 basis points. I could see a 65. And then you subtract out Tier 4 tariffs right? We got hit by a little bit Tier 4 stuff like SPINBRUSH and water showerheads and FLAWLESS. That's about 10 bps. And then some of the investments that Matt alluded to that we're going to spend back that's another 10 basis points so that gets you to 45. And then we're actually having a little better productivity by and large. So that's how you get to plus 15. So it's largely productivity driven. That's the reason we're doing better on the base business.
Cody Ross: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then just in regards to the retroactive tariff exemption, can you just specifically spell out for us what that is in relation to? And is this a onetime benefit? Are there any residual impacts into the fourth quarter into next year? Thank you. 
Rick Dierker: Yes, no problem. It's largely related to our WATERPIK, Water Flosser business, which got caught up in Tier 2. It was about $11 million in the quarter. We expect to get another $1 million or $2 million in the fourth quarter as some of that went to inventory and gets flushed through. On a margin basis it's neutral because we had a drag of 25 basis points in our outlook and then this comes back around. So now it's neutral in gross margin. So the dollars -- so in 2020 then it will be neutral on margin. But the dollars will still be there just like they are right now in 2019.
Cody Ross: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your question please.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I also had a question just on FLAWLESS. So as you look out the earnout that you expect to pay out in December 2021 given the shortfall that you expect this year do you still believe you're on track to be able to I guess get towards the high end of that payout on the earnout?
Matt Farrell: Yes, we do. We do Rupesh. There's a lot of opportunity internationally that and combined with the success we're having with new distribution wins we think we're still on track.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And it really comes down to what Matt said in his earlier comments. We still believe that business is going to grow plus 15% for the foreseeable future.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, so essentially this year you have a headwind and you expect to make it up over the next two years?
Rick Dierker: Yes.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Yes. Well only owned the business since May. I mean it's early days but a lot of good things are happening.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then on the tariff front just curious on your thoughts regarding Tier 4 whether there's anything that you built in for this and how you're thinking about it going forward?
Rick Dierker: Yes. I mean I just alluded to Cody that we got hit -- we will be getting hit with Tier four just like anybody else. And it's really three product lines for us SPINBRUSH, FLAWLESS and WATERPIK shower heads. And there's a few million bucks of a headwind in Q4. Remember some of the tariffs start September 1. Some of them start December 15. And we'll do what we do with WATERPIK, right? We go back to our suppliers and negotiate on sharing some of the tariff burden and we'll also look at pricing. And so we'll update you in February on what the net impact of any of that noise would be.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.
Nik Modi: Yes, thanks, good morning, everyone. Matt, maybe you can just talk a little bit about the input and cost environment has obviously been favorable. And do you expect for the next couple of months and even heading into 2020 that we'll see just more promotional and competitive spend, particularly as retailers look to push all their private label agendas? Any thoughts around that would be helpful.
Matt Farrell: Well, if you're saying that people are going to be spending things back, the trend would suggest no, so far. If you look at what's going on in laundry for example over the -- this year and the most recent quarter the laundry categories sold on deal was down 180 basis points. And so the laundry sold on deal was down 300 basis points. And I think, if you look at categories where there were price increases, I don't think it's logical for people to say well that was fun. We had the price increase for a year and now we're going to start dealing it all back. I mean, these are all public companies trying to increase their earnings year-over-year, so I don't think that would be illogical to think that those things would be dealt back.
Rick Dierker: And I would just add on the commodity side, Nik. You'll see in our Q but commodities and transportation for us we're still 110 basis point drag in the quarter. And if you parse out just commodities they were still a headwind for us around 70 basis points. Now part of that is because we have some hedges in place. And so those hedges in place roll off, that won't be a headwind. But we do have mid-single-digit increases for like litter raw materials as an example or high single-digit for sugar. So there's still inflation. There's not free fall deflation out there. I think it's improving no doubt. Some of our major commodities are actually down like ethylene and HDPE but not all of them are.
Nik Modi: Great. Super, helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Steve Powers: Yes. Thanks, guys. So operating conditions, it looks to me they seem more or less stable quarter-to-quarter, 3Q versus 2Q. And you're not really calling out anything going forward even related to the scanner data that Olivia referenced or the promotional environment in relation to Nik's question. So if that's the case, I guess why the implied deceleration in 4Q? Is there anything notable to call out?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Nothing different from what we called out last time, Steve. It's largely because we're pulling back from promotional spending. And the kind of same commentary we gave last call as we pull back on laundry, it may also sold on deal and on couponing. As we lap -- the example, I gave earlier in the call, as we lap a high volume number for litter, which is still really strong on a stack basis, all those things contribute to just the deceleration over the year.
Steve Powers: Okay. Okay. And then just kind of an accounting clarification. So when you lap the unique accounting treatment of FLAWLESS next year with fully consolidated revenue in that basis in the P&L 2020 versus 2019, can just talk about how you're going to treat that? Will you call out the delta as a unique M&A impact? Or will you treat that as accretive to organic growth or some kind of price mix? Just I need some verification of that...
Rick Dierker: Right. I'll try to put that in my upfront comments, but we will definitely just -- we'll pro forma what -- so for example in Q3 this year within the P&L, $20 million was there for FLAWLESS net sales and that represents a marketing profit. What the real net sales were they were around $60 million. So in Q3 next year, we'll do all of our organic growth off of $60 million.
Steve Powers: Okay. That’s perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Crédit Suisse. Your question please.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey, good morning, everybody. First maybe a quicker one on FLAWLESS and the retailer issue. Was it a temporary almost an inventory timing sort of thing? Or is this something more structural such as store closings something like that?
Matt Farrell: Well it's -- like I said, it's the most important retailer and they did curtail orders. We do see that in the fourth quarter. That seems to be coming back a little bit. But we don't expect to be as dependent upon that one retailer going forward considering the number of distribution wins that we have coming in February.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay got it. And are you able to provide some context on maybe the current channel mix and the channel mix you're looking to achieve as you own the business for longer for FLAWLESS?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, FLAWLESS there's a big opportunity in food. Very low ACV in food, so we expect to increase that dramatically. So when I say we have 55% ACV, there's still a lot of runway. And I would say that's a class of trade that we have the biggest opportunity.
Rick Dierker: Yes. On the second one, not really class of trade but only 17% of their sales is currently international. And that business is just going to grow as we plug that into our international footprint.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your question please.
Lauren Lieberman: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was just hoping if you guys could talk a little bit about the 4Q marketing spend fully understanding it's about tying to a full year number but it's an enormous amount of spend in one quarter. So, I just love any color on the balance between Q3, Q4 kind of what shifted and why in terms of timing? Because I can't find a quarter where you've spent the level implied in 4Q previously. So just it's interesting to see where that's going. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good question. If you look at Q2 and Q3 and you look at marketing as a percentage of sales you'd see Q2 is 12%; Q3 11.5%. So it's sort of in the sweet spot of trying to hit 11.7% on a full year basis. So Q1 was lower. We did shift a few million dollars out of Q3 into Q4. There are some things happening in Q4 such as the OXICLEAN DARK PROTECT. It's a new product launch that is a second half launch so we got some money behind that. We also have a couple of 2020 launches that are being pulled forward. One for BATISTE and we have a TROJAN G q condom that's shipping early so we're moving up some support. So on a full year basis, we'll hit 11.7%. We have had quarters in the past that have been in excess of 13%. If you went back to last year 2018 I think it was a second quarter. It was over 13%. So it has happened in the past.
Rick Dierker: Yeah. And you're right Lauren it's up -- it's going to be up in the $25 million $30 million year-over-year. Some of that is some of the acquisitions right? WATERPIK has some spending in Q4 FLAWLESS has some spending in Q4. It will be the a normal kind of P&L marketing spend for November/December. So some of that is just – like Matt said some of the shifts because of the resets, but also higher numbers for the acquisition.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Your question please.
Adam Kozek: Hi, guys. This is actually Adam on for Joe. I know you guys touched on a bunch of my questions but I was just curious a little more specifically being underpenetrated in China today, I guess, how quickly do you think maybe you can get perhaps a mid-single digits as a percent of sales?
Matt Farrell: Well, Broad question. International we just a year ago 1.5 years ago we started up with Shanghai Jahwa and have baking soda, toothpaste, dry shampoo and some high there. We're having a lot of success with water flossers and vitamins. The business has been growing at 25% annually. It's likely going to be the fastest-growing part of Church & Dwight going forward. But I wouldn't speculate just yet as to how fast we're going to get to your target.
Adam Kozek: Okay. That's helpful. color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Your question please.
Jonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple of detailed questions. First, Rick you commented on club and on – sorry on couponing and on online. Can you comment on that bridge between track channels and your report? Can you comment is club still a positive relative to that? Any comments you can give around that first of all? Secondly, is there anything structural going in couponing? I mean you're pulling back a little bit on the promo overall leaning a little more on price versus volume. But are coupons getting less effective? Or is there anything like insight you have as far as maybe there's a little bit of a different approach there structurally so we'll see less of that in the future? And third just to be -- it's not the most important thing in a world but just curious little detail like with this tariff relief how does that actually work mechanically? So the government collects a tariff from you because of something you bought. Is – was any of that relief that you recognize this quarter ever relate to products that were sold and where your costed them in a prior quarter? I know that's super technical but I've dealt with these situations before actually a long time ago and I just want to make sure I understand it. Thanks so much.
Rich Dierker: Yes. Okay. Well those are three questions. First one on club. Club is growing. It's doing well. The bulk of the growth though difference between tracked and untracked channels is online and that's really to Matt's comments about 30% growth. Amazon is doing great. She's always doing great. So club's a positive tailwind but it's not a huge driver. Number two coupons. Coupons it's just part of the price/mix equation and price value equation. And we've – as we pull back from laundry promotion or other promotion Matt alluded to almost 600 basis points of pullback on amounts sold on deal for laundry. Coupon follows that trend. Coupons are really meant for new product introductions and I think you'll see more of that over time and less on fixing price value differences. And the third one was on technically on the tariff. You're right. When you get a tariff rebate it doesn't really follow the P&L per se. It follows when that – they give you a credit back for all the imported product that you have. It's up to us to figure out what goes to P&L what goes to inventory. But for us we did get some tariff relief all the way back to – when we started importing the product with the new tariff which have been like July August of last year. So it's about 12 months of relief we got. And it just so happened that this year, we had forecasted 12 months' worth of occurrence, so that's why there's no impact to the full year gross margin.
Jonathan Feeney: Super helpful and thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from -- our final question comes from the line of Steve Strycula from UBS. Your question, please.
Steve Strycula: Yes. Hi. Good morning. First, I have a question on laundry and then a quick follow-up question on FLAWLESS. For the laundry piece, can you help us think through the different market shares trends in the quarter that you saw from both, liquid laundry which seemed quite strong and then the share gains were a little bit more muted for the pods business. Anything to read in or think of that happened this quarter? And how do we think about that forward?
Matt Farrell: Yes. That's a good question. If you look at the shares for the quarter, I mentioned that ARM & HAMMER was up 40 bps and XTRA was up 10 bps. Going the other way for us was OXICLEAN. OXICLEAN was down 40 bps, which is now 0.7% share. But the two big brands that we have ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, certainly, they're very healthy. If you look at the suppliers and you look at all the brands for the three suppliers, P&G, Church & Dwight Henkel, I just gave you the math for Church & Dwight being up 10 bps. P&G was up a full share point and Henkel was down 140 bps in share. And that was across all and Purex. So I hope that gives you a perspective on what's going on. As far as unit dose goes, unit dose for us, Purex has reentered after a three-year absence in the pods category. And they entered with a very low price point and they have gained 130 basis points of share. At the same time, Simply Tide pods were heavily promoted this quarter. Actually, they're up 1,000 basis points as far as percentage sold on deal year-over-year, which is kind of massive. And at the same time, we had pulled back 900 basis points year-over-year for a percentage sold on deals. So combination of all that we -- our ARM & HAMMER pods actually lost 30 bps of share in the quarter, so we only grew a little over 1%, 1%, 1.5%. So for our part, we'll be focused on having the right value proposition for the consumer which is a combination of quality and the right price. But that'll give you a sense for what's going on dynamic-wise.
Steve Strycula: That's really helpful. And then, as a follow-up to Kaumil's question on the key retailer, I might be a little dense this morning, I just didn't get what happened there. Did they trial the product and it just didn't really resonate for that customer base specifically? Or do you have to do it like cleaner aisle impact? Can you help us understand that a little bit better?
Matt Farrell: No, that's purely a decision on the part of the retailer. It has nothing to do with velocity.
Steve Strycula: Okay. And what are the trade-offs as we think about transitioning to on-shelf versus in-aisle display? Is it higher in slotting fees? Where would you be receiving product placement next to how -- what are the cost implications?
Matt Farrell: Yes. No, you'll have to stay tuned on a product placement. We're pretty excited about where we're going to be placing some major retailers in February. As far as the dynamics goes, replenishment is different for in-aisle than if you have displays and that's our sweet spot. We're not a display-driven business. Obviously, we use displays from time to time as promotions, but that's not central to our go-to-market strategy. So in-aisle is where we're going to be able to help the FLAWLESS business.
Steve Strycula: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does….
Matt Farrell: All right. I think we're going to wrap it up right now. We'll see everybody at the exchange in February. I mean, final note, we had a super quarter. We're going to have a good fourth quarter and we're looking forward to 2020. So we'll talk to you later.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll provide a few comments on the quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions. Our Q2 was another outstanding quarter for our company. We have lots of good news including higher than expected organic sales growth and earnings per share growth. Q2 reported sales grew 5%. Organic sales growth was 4.9%, which exceeded our outlook of 3.5%. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.57, exceeding our outlook by $0.05. In the U.S., organic sales grew 5%. Our categories are growing. In fact, 13 of our 15 categories grew during the quarter and our market shares were healthy as evidenced by 9 of our 12 power brands growing or holding share. We continue to have success in the online class of trade. Online sales continue to grow rapidly at a 28% clip this quarter. And we expect online sales to exceed 8% of our annual sales in 2019 compared to 7% of 2018. Our international consumer business delivered another terrific quarter with 9.1% organic growth. International is a growth driver and a perennial bright spot for Church & Dwight. This is unlike many of our peers. U.K., Mexico and our Global Markets Group, which we formally referred to as our export business, had particularly strong quarters. But one final note on international. We exited our Brazilian subscale consumer business in the quarter. Now turning to Specialty Products, Q2 was another challenging quarter, as organic sales declined 5.4%. We are experiencing lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers, who continue to be hurt by low milk prices. Milk prices increased in April, May, and June, and recent industry forecasts are projecting milk prices to continue to rise throughout the second half. We still feel good about our long-term 5% organic sales algorithm as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like poultry, cattle and swine. Non-dairy represents approximately 25% of our animal productivity business right now and we expect that non-dairy business to grow sales approximately 10% this year. Let's go back to the U.S. Consumer business for a moment and call out a couple of bright lights in the quarter. In the laundry category, which grew 1.2%, ARM & HAMMER margin consumption was up 9.5% and we gained 0.8 share points. As anticipated, the promotional environment in laundry continued to be muted in Q2. For our part, we reduced ARM & HAMMER laundry percentage promotion by 220 basis points, while maintaining growth. We expect to continue reducing our year-over-year promotional spend in the second half. Our new product ARM & HAMMER FADE DEFENSE is doing well and meeting our expectations. Over in personal care, the new line of BATISTE Hair Benefits has given consumers the ability to shop for dry shampoo, the same way they shop the broader hair care category. By that, I mean by benefit. In particular, our new BATISTE volumizing was the number one skew in dollar sales growth in the dry shampoo category in Q2. Our new BATISTE hydrating product for women with fine hair is also doing well. BATISTE continues to gain share with a 33% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category, more than doubling the category growth of 16%. BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 14th consecutive quarter. Next new product to talk about is NAIR LEG MASK. NAIR LEG MASKS have been a hit with consumers driving our brand to a record high 70.2% dollar share of depilatories in Q2. I want to point out that Rick and I right now are in Fort Collins, Colorado. We're spending time with WATERPIK team and we're seeing firsthand the great momentum that this business is generating. A great example is that WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION launch is exceeding expectations for 2019. We have high levels of interest from both dental professionals and consumers. And with SONIC-FUSION you may recall consumers can floss and brush at the same time. And in the month of June SONIC-FUSION was our best-selling ordepic model at key retail accounts. Let's talk about price increases now. As you know, price increases were executed in late 2018 and in April 2019 and contributed to our gross margin expansion. We said last quarter the volume impacts on the brands in which we took price were better than we expected and that continues to be the case. In terms of category health for the five categories where we took pricing late last year, all five categories are showing positive category growth despite volume impacts. We closed the FLAWLESS acquisition in May and the integration plan is on track. We are excited to own the market leader in women's electric hair removal products. FLAWLESS is a fast-growing brand which complements our specialty hair care business and we expect FLAWLESS to grow sales 15% annually or higher and contribute to our long-term growth both domestically and international. In conclusion, we had a terrific quarter. We feel really good about the rest of the year. We're on track to exceed our evergreen business model in 2019. Next up is Rick to give you details on the second quarter and the outlook for Q3 and the improved full year.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57 per share compared to $0.49 in 2018, up 16.3%. The $0.57 exceeded our outlook of $0.52 largely due to better topline, improved gross margin, a shift in marketing and lower tax. Q2 reported EPS was $0.55. We have three adjustments to get to adjusted EPS. First is related to the sale of our consumer business in Brazil. This is a $7 million or $0.03 charge that was largely non-cash. Second, we had favorability of approximately $7 million or $0.02 in relation to reducing the earnout for our Passport acquisition within our SPD business. We're still happy with our entry to the food safety business and the diversification that it offers our SPD division. Lastly, as we mentioned last quarter, we booked an earnout adjustment for the FLAWLESS business, largely based and attached to time. These FLAWLESS earnout adjustments will continue quarterly. Reported revenue was up 5%. Organic sales were up 4.9%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 3.5%. Q2 was the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 4% organic growth and the fourth consecutive quarter of positive price and product mix. Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 5% as positive price and mix drove a 5.9% increase. This was slightly offset by negative volume of 0.9% due to lower OXICLEAN laundry promotional spending and the expected volume decline associated with announced price increases. Growth was led by ARM & HAMMER liquid, ARM & HAMMER pumping cat litter, WATERPIK oral care products, OXICLEAN stain fighters, VITAFUSION Gummy Vitamins, XTRA liquid laundry detergent and ARM & HAMMER scent boosters. International organic growth was up 9.1%, driven primarily by our ARM & HAMMER, BATISTE and VMS power brands. For SPD division, organic sales declined 5.4%. And although demand for our products continue to grow in the poultry industry, demand in the dairy industry continues to be a challenge. Turning now to gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was 44.6%, a 30 basis point increase from a year ago due to price increases, the impact of acquisitions and productivity programs, partially offset by higher commodity and manufacturing costs. This performance once again exceeded our expectation and we now expect full year gross margin to be up 80 basis points. This represents a 30 basis point increase to our previous gross margin outlook and is attributable to a more favorable forecast on commodities as well as the impact of acquisitions. On the commodity side, one example of the recent gross margin forecast change is upwind. Three months ago, we would've expected the back half of 2019 to be up over 20% compared to 2018. The latest information that we have indicates that prices will now be flat to down year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are largely hedged on most of our key commodities. Moving now to -- down $7.3 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percent of sales decreased 130 basis points to 12%. And we have shifted some spend to the second half. This is largely as expected as some retail resets have been pushed later in the year. For example additives and litter. We are raising our full year expectations for marketing as a percent of sales to be flat with 2018, an increase of 20 basis points since our last outlook. For SG&A, Q2 reported SG&A increased 120 basis points year-over-year. SG&A as percent of sales would have been flat excluding impact from the FLAWLESS acquisition as well as the previously discussed onetime items such as Brazil and the earnout adjustments. Adjusted net operating profit. Operating margin for the quarter was 17.8%, representing 90 basis point increase over Q2 2018. Other expense all-in was $17.1 million. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 18.7% compared to 21.7% in 2018, a decrease of 300 basis points primarily driven by higher number of stock options exercised. And now to cash. For the first half of 2019, net cash from operating activities was $351 million, a $28.5 million increase from the prior year driven by higher cash earnings. Now one metric to note is our cash earnings are up 15% year-to-date versus a year ago. And now for the full year. We now expect organic sales growth to be approximately 4%, up from our previous outlook of 3.5%. The organic outlook for the divisions are 3.5% for domestic, 7.5% for international and down slightly for SPD. We now expect reported sales growth of approximately 6%. We now expect full year gross margin to be up 80 basis points. And we continue to expect full year operating margin to increase 50 basis points. We now expect 2019 adjusted EPS of $2.47 per share or adjusted EPS growth of 9%. This is at the upper end of the range of our previous 79% outlook. Similar to prior years to the extent that the business outperforms this guidance, we will look to reinvest the earnings to continue our momentum. And with that, Matt and I will be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. You may begin.
Kevin Grundy: Hey good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter.
Matt Farrell: Hey Kevin.
Rick Dierker: Hi Kevin.
Kevin Grundy: Let's start on pricing. So, obviously, it's very good right now in HPC. And commodity outlook Rick as you mentioned is more favorable. Matt, curious how you assess risk on a couple of fronts. Number one, the competitors start to become more promotional on price. And then two, also potential that retailers see this -- excuse me moderation in commodity cost and conversations begin to open up around the potential for more trade investments from manufacturers. And then I have a follow-up.
Matt Farrell: Okay. Here's the way I would think about it, Kevin. We've had only four left quarters of higher prices being in effect and the price increases were justified by cost increases that had accumulated over many years from many CPG companies including us. And it is true that some of the input cost appeared to be flattening or decreasing. But big commodities always get headlines but there are other input costs that don't necessarily follow the same trends. So it depends on product category that you're in. So I'd caution again I'd say pulp and paper may be down, may be resin abating and that's a barometer to put respect for all the costs that justified the price increases. You've got to also keep in mind retailers are making more money now too. So making more penny profit as a result of the price increases. So to the extent there's a gross profit help because it would appear some input cost might be abating, I wouldn't expect everybody to be jumped to reinvesting in price maybe much more reasonable innovation as healthy categories compete on innovation. Of course, the changes we'll respond to it.
Kevin Grundy: Okay, all right. Thanks, Matt. One follow-up and I'll pass it on. Laundry so a two-part question one on liquid and one on unit there. So promo levels are down and you guys have talked about the opportunity to take down promo levels. It looks like you're following that course, but at the same time market share has started to slow here a little bit. Maybe speak to a little bit how you're trying to strike that right balance between taking promo levels down essentially getting the factor price increase with market share objectives? And then the second part is unit dose where you're also pulling back on promotion. And Matt I guess for you as you talk about the opportunity to potentially get “your fair share” in the category given the company's slow start going back six or seven years ago, but that hasn't really played out at least perhaps at the pace maybe that the company would have hoped. So why don't you think we've seen more rapid market share gains in unit dose from ARM & HAMMER with P&G still sitting there at 80% market share. And I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Well, the unit dose categories continues to grow. It's around 17%, 18% right now. I would say that the unit dose growth has been exceptional for ARM & HAMMER. We were growing double-digits virtually every quarter since it launched. The unit dose category had slowed it only grew 6.8% this quarter. But ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 16%. So look we're still climbing the ladder here. We only had the OXICLEAN as well as that component of unit dose, but of course that's abated quite a bit. OXICLEAN was down significantly year-over-year because we did cut back on promotion. So remember that's at the premium end. If you look at the what's going on for value laundry detergent year-over-year see if you look at Tide simply Purex and so on -- ARM & HAMMER everybody's pulled back in the second quarter. So that's a trend we've seen now for pretty much four consecutive quarters. So we'd expect that continue in the second half and that is our plan right now. Of course if that changes, we can react quickly.
Rick Dierker: And I would just add Kevin even with that pull back ARM & HAMMER continues to gain share, right? Really the pull back in Oxi laundry is where maybe there's some share to find.
Matt Farrell: Yeah, I mean, ARM & HAMMER share is 11% of the laundry category and now we're up 80 bps in the second quarter, so it's pretty significant.
Kevin Grundy: Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. You may begin.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on the next quarter. So as we look at pricing, so if we look at the volume price trade off that you saw during the quarter, will that in line with your expectations?
Matt Farrell: Yeah, it was. I mean, for the company we talked about 4.8% price/mix and volume is relatively flat, for domestic business it was 5.9% positive price/mix and volume was down 0.9%. And if you strip out the record pull back on Oxi laundry volume would have been positive. So Q2 probably looks a lot like the full year the next few quarters in my mind.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then from a category perspective, it sounds like you actually had more categories that grew this quarter. So as you look at your data, what was the blended category growth in the areas you can see versus maybe the prior quarters?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. It's pretty consistent. It's about 3%.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then my final question on the FLAWLESS acquisition now that you've owned it a few months any surprises as far in what you're seeing in the business?
Rick Dierker: Yeah. Only good surprises. Really it's a terrific business. We expected 15-plus percent sales growth and we should easily exceed that target in 2019.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: All right, Rupesh.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Cody Ross: Hi. Good morning everyone. This is actually Cody on for Jason this morning. Thank you for taking our questions. Just want to stick on FLAWLESS for a little bit. On our math FLAWLESS boosted net sales by $7.4 million in the quarter, but was only there for about two months suggesting its full quarter sales were approximately $10 million. This came in below our expectations. How does this compare with the performance a year ago and relative to your expectations? And also what's the normal seasonality for this business?
Matt Farrell: Remember we didn't own it a year ago, number one. Number two, we generally do not comment on specific brand sales or factor sales within a quarter. I can tell you that they hit on number that we expected in Q2. We're very optimistic about full year as they continue to gain more traditional retail distribution.
Rick Dierker: The only thing I would add is there's a little bit of seasonality in the business, it's probably a little bit stronger in the back half of the year, but like Matt said it hit the numbers that we are expecting right on. And we think there's a lot of the momentum behind that business.
Cody Ross: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. And then also just as far as the stock buybacks, you didn't buy any stock this quarter. Last year you only repurchased stock in the first quarter of 2018, as you dealt with integrating acquisitions. You still have roughly $400 million in authorization and your leverage stands at just two times. How should we think about capital allocation priorities for the balance of the year? Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. Well back when we announced the acquisition for FLAWLESS, we've said, number one, capital allocation priority is M&A far and away, right? And that's what we've been doing, that's what we're going to continue to do. And at that time we said we would not do all the buyback that we previously thought we might do. So we are effectively done with the buyback for this year, as we continue to manage our debt EBITDA ratios just have dry powder for future acquisitions.
Cody Ross: Thank you very much. Congrats on the great quarter. I'll pass it.
Matt Farrell: Thank you, Cody.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Steve Powers: Thanks. Good morning. Look, I guess the question for me, just to start is, if you step back and with across the peer set, this is a bit a good quarter and a good year more or less across the board. Not to take any from your results, I mean your results have been great and your outlook seems upbeat and that's fantastic. But I guess, as you step back the question for me is, why do you think this is the year that things are finally falling to place across the industry after years of big brands struggling to get price protect margin and fend off competition? Are there specific drivers that you would call out? And do you see it as sustainable, or is this just a sweet spot we're going through here?
Matt Farrell: Well, you got to keep in mind that there has been a lot of price increases across many, many categories in CPG. And I think, there was probably a lot of fear for many years as to whether or not the prices actually could be raised and that they would stick. And so, consequently they have. And I think that's been maybe a surprise to maybe a lot of investor’s, maybe it's a surprise to some CPG companies. We certainly haven't raised prices in years. But the fact that the companies have raised prices, what it does suggest is that maybe we won't wait as long next time before the next round of price increases happen, as long as their costs are justified. But I don't have any magical answers as to why it kind of worked this year. I think one thing that helps is that the economy is strong. When you got a strong consumer that's the time to do it. We’d have a far different result, I expect if we were in a much weaker economy.
Steve Powers: Yes. Okay. And so I guess to follow on to that is, as you look out over the next couple of quarters maybe two questions on the makeup of organic growth. I guess, in the quarter, do you have a sense for how much of the price mix that you're seeing right now is, pure price versus more trade-up and mix? And as you look out over the next couple of quarters, how do you expect those drivers to put the balance of price versus volume and mix to shake out and maybe rebalance a bit?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the questions Steve. Price mix like we said for the company it was 4.8%, that's largely price, right? I mean that's -- with only parse of that between price and mix, but largely price. And like I said previously, maybe to Rupesh, we believe that trend to continue for the balance of the year. And for Q2 for domestic, it looks very positive 5.9% for price/mix and volume was down almost a point. And so we think that trend's going to continue as well. And we'll lap that early next year.
Steve Powers: Okay. If I could squeeze in one more specific to litter, the trends there seemed -- sorry? Okay. So just on litter, the trends there seemed still broadly positive. I guess just in the syndicated data, you’re starting to see some deceleration and some share trend degradation there with Nestlé and private label or the beneficiaries. Is there anything that you would call in that category that is shifting that you're on watch for?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I got a comment maybe Rick want to chime in too. But if you look at the category in the second quarter it grew 8.9%. And ARM & HAMMER cat litter grew 10.4%. So our share was up 30 bps in the second quarter to 23.4%. So we're the number two cat litter right now. And within -- the category isn't that promotional. I mean the category actually reduced shelf sold on deal by 50 basis points year-over-year. It is true the private label picked up 90 bps in the quarter to 10.8%. So there's definitely some strength in private label. But historically private label has been around 9% to 11% of the category. So I wouldn't say that that would necessarily be alarming private label at 10.8%.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I would just add Steve. You should expect our litter business to slow a little bit in the second half. Remember the competition raised price earlier than we did, so we've got a little bit of volume benefit early in the second half. So, on a stack basis we're still strong, but it's just, we're comping higher volume growth number.
Steve Powers: Yes. Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from -- will come from the line of Steve Strycula from UBS. You may begin.
Steve Strycula: Hi, good morning. So really solid quarter on organic sales throughout the consumer business, how do we think about 3Q in the back half? Why does it step down a little bit lower the two-year stacks aren't materially different? That would be the first part of my question. Is there anything sequentially decelerating?
Rick Dierker: No, not really. We talked about it. The two-year stack is a little different, right? The first half of this year is about 4.7% at the average that implies a 3.2% in the back half which is down 150 basis points. So 50 bps was just because the second half of 2018 was so strong 4.5% versus 4% in the first half of 2018. So 50 bps of 150 is really just comps. And then the other 100 bps is what we've been talking about Matt went through it in detail just lower promotional spending in general both trade and couponing.
Steve Strycula: Okay. And then Rick in the past quarters you've given us a nice like put and take for the various gross margin components. Would you mind kind of just rattling that off really quickly for us?
Rick Dierker: Yeah. No problem. So for the quarter right we're up 30 basis points. Price volume mix was really strong plus 230 basis points, productivity again strong plus 130 basis points, acquisition impact plus 40 basis points, and then inflation minus 370 basis points. That inflation number includes commodities, it includes other manufacturing, and it includes tariffs, it includes the fact that we have a prior year one-time benefit with the change in accounting and other stuff. So a lot in that number but that's the detail.
Steve Strycula: Okay. And to close out, Matt a strategic question for you. On Specialty Products, I know it's has performed maybe the way you'd like year –to-date. But taking the long-term view why is this a synergistic business with your consumer arm which is really doing quite well right now? How integrated is it into your core operations? And why is it core for the long term? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yeah. It's integrated into our core operations, because we have centralized our supply chain meaning that baking soda that's produced by our plants it has a destination of going to the consumer side of the business or to the specialty chemical side of the business where you have that bulk sodium bicarbonate. So it is fully integrated. We're doing separate plants for each of the businesses. The reason why we like this business long term is number one is these products are labeled ARM & HAMMER. And ARM & HAMMER has a fabulous name within the animal productivity industry particularly in dairy. And one of the things I mentioned in my remarks, upfront is that, if you look at the animal productivity, business which represents two-thirds of Specialty Product, the non-dairy business is growing double digits this year. And those are the businesses that we acquired over the past few years. We bought VI-COR Agro BioSciences and then Passport. So we think long-term the dairy side of the business is going to be less significant to us. Non-dairy is going to grow and it's got a nice challenge because of population growth. And the short story is demand for proteins going to grow over the next 20 30 years because population is going to grow from seven billion to nine billion and you got to feed people. So I think being cattle swine and poultry is a good move for the company. So, long-term we feel good about it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. You may begin.
Joe Altobello: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.
Matt Farrell: Hey, Joe.
Joe Altobello: So first question on personal care. Sales do continue be sluggish. I think it's more of the same really some of which seems to structural in some of your categories, but it was below what we were expecting despite having FLAWLESS for a portion of the quarter. So what do you think it turnaround some of these personal care categories that has been slow to really respond?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. You got to look at what's in the numbers. WATERPIK and BATISTE obviously are good growers for us. And then FLAWLESS is going to be another one. So that's going to help our overall numbers going forward, definitely as you point out, have some structural issues for example in condoms, the condom category, kids category declining birth rates alternatives for contraception beyond condoms being IUDs diaphragms Plan B. Then, we have a couple of other categories that are struggling for L'IL CRITTERS for example, which is a children's gummy vitamins struggle because of just intense competition lot of competition in there. And then in SPINBRUSH, again the SPINBRUSH had some struggles as well. We have a new entrant in that called quip, which is someone we're going to have to be dealing with. So yeah, you have a lot of the brands and maybe only growing small single digits or declining low-single digits, because we have a lot of brands in there. But they all add up so this quarter personal care was up 1%.
Rick Dierker: And I would just add on to that Joe, its Rick. I would say that 1% was maybe depressed a little bit, right? We had some price increases that got announced early in the year. And so whether it's TROJAN or ORAJEL, some retailers did buy in a couple of weeks into Q1. So, Q2 looks a little bit lower. But by and large I think we've met sort of our expectation.
Joe Altobello: Got it. Okay. And just secondly you guys have mentioned this earlier, but we do seem to be in unchartered territory in some of these categories, particularly, on the wholesale side or on the household side on pricing at promo levels, this has now been an industry that has always been disciplined on promotion to say the least. I understand it's early, but it seems like you guys are thinking about 2020 promo level to look a lot like what they're looking like in 2019 at this point.
Matt Farrell: No, we're really looking at a couple of quarters ahead Joe. So, we haven't made any commentary on what we expect to happen in the future. But considering only how hard people are fighting to increase their profits year-over-year. I don't expect that that's going to turn around at least in the next six months.
Joe Altobello: Okay. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I actually have a question on your marketing expense in the quarter. I'd like to hear more about why the lower spend happened in Q2 and actually Q1 was below as well. You guys did touch on this, but did this in any way suggests your pipeline of innovation was delayed? Also based on your full year guidance, which I think is for flat marketing spend as a percentage of sales, it suggests your second half spend will really need to ramp by maybe be as much as 16% to about 12.5% as a percentage of sales and that would be up from about I guess under 11% in the first half. So, I just really wanted to understand if that is realistic. Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes, thanks Bonnie. Just to give you some color on Q2, right? We said Q2 marketing spend was down 130 basis points. Part of that was just the FLAWLESS accounting impact. If you strip out the FLAWLESS impact, right, it is just going to net sales and their dollar spend in marketing happening in the marketing line. That was worth 30 bps. So, really down 100. I'd say we expected to be down 100, right? We knew that the retail reset shifted for litter and for additives as an example in the back half of the year. So, we didn't go into the detail in our outlook by quarter and we don't really intend to do that. I would just tell you to give you some confidence that yes marketing's supposed to be up pretty big in the back half probably up 30 or 40 bps in the third quarter and the balance will be in the fourth quarter.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And just something to add to that. We got a couple of our new products the resets are happening for some major retailers in the second half. They would be OxiClean Dark Protect and also Cloud Control which is a cat litter. So, right now we have a low ACV, so we're not going to turn on the advertising towards second half.
Bonnie Herzog: And then maybe on the same topic, looking forward, do you expect your spend or marketing spend level to stay kind of where they've been trending? They've been inching up over the years. Is that how we should think about this over the medium and long-term?
Rick Dierker: We've said right where we're at this range whether it's 11.7, 11.5, 11.9 this range has been really good for us, right? And you could see that in the share results, you can see that in the category growth results. So, we think we're in a sweet spot.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. And then if I may just wanted to circle back to something you mentioned which is M&A. You briefly touched on it. So, I was hoping you guys could give us a sense as to how strong your appetite is right now for acquisition, especially after you just completed the FLAWLESS acquisition. And then you mentioned you're kind of building the dry powder. So, do you have enough? And how do you view the current competitive environment for M&A?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, look we are in acquisition platform over serial acquirer and we continue to be active despite the FLAWLESS acquisition. Rick can take you through what our leverage ratio is right now. And acquisition is the number one destination for our cash flow. And as many of you know we have a very disciplined process. We have acquisition criteria and we will step up for opportunities that meet our criteria. Just to kind of illustrate how important this is for our business model, we've done 18 acquisitions since the year 2000. So, we actually have no restraints right now with respect to doing our next acquisition. But Rick can chime in on that.
Rick Dierker: Yes, I mean our leverage ratio is going to be sub two times by the end of 2019. So, plenty of room. I think the way we struck the FLAWLESS deal, did nothing but help that. And as Matt said we are busy looking for the next deal.
Bonnie Herzog: What's the environment like right now you guys? Has it changed dramatically since last year for instance?
Matt Farrell: I think the best way to respond to that is that generally anything that's for sale, particularly in the U.S. where we are aware of. And that's simply because we're regarded as a buyer. So a lot of people like to get us in the process. But I would say, it's no different than it was a year ago.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. You may begin.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning.
Matt Farrell: Hey, Bill.
Bill Chappell: Just to follow up on a couple of your comments. On innovation pipeline being delayed, maybe give some ideas of where that was? And where you would expect to kind of a lift in terms of products and as we move to the second half from those innovations?
Rick Dierker: Yes. No I've mentioned there was OXICLEAN dark protect, so that's the - our new additive for dark clothing. And the other one is CLUMP & SEAL CLOUD CONTROL, which is a cat litter. So those are the two where we have low ACV right now, low distribution. And we expect with some of the major resets in the second half, that's going to pick up quite a bit.
Bill Chappell: And is it safe to say that the cat litter would be the bigger of the innovations where you see more marketing dollars? I mean, OXI seems a little bit smaller?
Matt Thomas: Yes, I think, that's fair, to be more -- litter has been bigger for us, right?
Bill Chappell: And then, what are you seeing in terms of the outlook? It seems that you and your competitors are all benefiting from pricing and not a lot of it being dealt back. Is the expectation -- can there be another round of the pricing, as we move into 2020? Are you starting to see some deal backs as we move into the fall, or is it -- it seems much more rational than it's been in years past.
Rick Dierker: Yes. I think you got to remind -- everybody's got to remind, so it's only been four or less quarters of higher prices. So it's something like we've been living under this now new price umbrella. And remember all those price increases were cost justified. So, I do think, at some time in the future I think that the muscle that was really maybe atrophied or dormant for many years for CPG companies maybe now, who has just sprung to life. So people may be more likely to go forward with cost justified price increases. But I think the requirement is still there for cost justification. Without that, you won't have price increases.
Matt Thomas: And remember you can't go to retailers and say, this is what the forecast says, first is the commodity, because is what happened. Right? So even if that same prices are expect to go up 20% in 2020, you got to wait till that actually happens to have that conversation.
Bill Chappell: Got it. And just any further thoughts. I know that, on laundry, there's certainly a lot of conversation about P&G. But in terms of the other competitor trying to get the Henkel's comments of trying to be more aggressive. If you're seeing that more at the high-end on Brazil, or if that's -- if you feel like that might be more on the low-end Sun and mid-tier type priced products?
Matt Thomas: Well, if you just look at Q2 as an indication, I guess, I said earlier that value section both Tide Simply, Purex and Sun rolled down, sold on deals year-over-year. The same is true for Persil. So we pulled back on sold on deal coupon or might have transferred over there. But that's would suggest that there's been pull-back on price. The other side of the coin is that, at least Purex came back into the market with unit dose this year, having been absent for many years. So much rather see people compete on innovation and that would be a good example of it.
Bill Chappell: Got it Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America. You may begin.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thank you. I was wondering since you're with the team at WATERPIK, if you could provide a bit more color on that business. Just sort of opportunity ahead, beyond just higher penetration of consumer, your potential to expand into other adjacent categories as well with that brand. Thanks.
Matt Thomas: Yes. WATERPIK is a wonderful business. This business has been around since the 1960s. And the people out here, there's 190 people up in Fort Collins Colorado, are experts in water-jet technology. So they invented the WATERPIK. In fact, back in the '60s, it's kind of a fun fact, Lyndon Johnson [ph] gave WATERPIK as a -- to the foreign dignitaries as a sign of American ingenuity and innovation. So a fun fact for you, Olivia. But this is a business that really started to take off three years ago; maybe four years ago, as a result of instituting a bunch of learn program and really communicating to dentists and hygienists in the United States about the benefits of WATERPIK it then turnaround and recommended it to consumers. So there's a lot of runway ahead for this business. If you look at battery-operated toothbrush say what's the household penetration in the 40s, 40% would have powered toothbrushes. And water flosses are more in the low-20s. So we see there's a lot of opportunity if that were what we're going to be shooting for. A lot of opportunity to grow in the U.S. And then outside the U.S. is really the big opportunity. International is only 20% of the business today. There's no reason why the international business should far exceed the size of the U.S. business. So we just think focusing on water flosses and that opportunity had with all the science that's behind these water flosses and the greater interest now in gum health. And you even see that in the toothpaste category, both Crest and Colgate have products that are directed towards gum health and toothpaste. So I don't think there's no need really right now to say we're going to be branching into other categories. We want to nail the opportunity that we have in front of us.
Olivia Tong: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe if you could talk a bit about the whole portfolio. The spread and growth between household and personal care in consumer house line pretty dramatically this year. Obviously, the pricing is proportionately better in household. But what's your view on the go forward? And while we talk a lot about M&A with you guys, what about the other side? How often do you do a portfolio review and assess the brand and their contribution to the total company?
Rick Dierker: Olivia, this is Rick. I would just say that as we pull back more on our household business, you're going to see the gap narrow between household and personal care growth it should be more balanced in the back half of the year.
Matt Farrell: Yes. And longer term Olivia it is true that household has been around a lot longer and bigger than our personal care business. We've -- a lot of our acquisitions have been on the personal care side over time. But we're optimistic about our ability to grow on long term. We -- our algorithm is that we grow top line 3%; bottom line 8%. And we think we have the portfolio that can do that. So we don't have a lot of flash, but we're steady as a company. So people invest in the company can't bet that we're going to hit those numbers year after year after year with the portfolio that we have. And we are going to continue to add to it. And we have 12 brands today to make up 80% of our revenues and profits. And 12 today, 20 tomorrow. We have such cash, which is a flywheel, so we can continue to add good brands to the portfolio.
Olivia Tong: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. You may begin.
Andrea Teixeira: Thanks, good morning. So my question is on the organic sales growth bridge. Given that you had the 5% growth in the second quarter, why are you expecting a deceleration has occurred? And related to that, we have heard from some of your competitors calling about 50 bps of pull forward of inventory because of the one-day delivery. And just to match the service levels online. So in particular, if you continue to grow faster in e-commerce as we saw we heard you say 27, 28, did you call in a similar impact that you had in the quarter for your 5%, 4.9% to be precise and you're banking into that as a slow down? And you can also -- can you also please update on the international also kind of showing a sequential deceleration, but obviously it's still above your long-term algorithm? And if I can squeeze a little bit on Rick's commentary just a follow-up on gross margin. You said about 350 basis points inflation on the COGS. But if you're saying like obviously the commodity outlook is better, but you have the hedges so are you seeing that starting to benefit you in the fourth quarter, or just next year? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Okay, Andrea. I'm going to do my best. It's a long list. So we're getting sales growth deceleration from the first half, second half I already touched on that. It was 4.7% in the first half. 3.2% is the implied number for the back half, 4% for the full year. It's down 150 basis points. 50 bps because of kind of the stack of the comp first half of 2018 was 4% growth and it was 4.5% in the second half of 2018. Another 100 basis points as well as promotional spending both trade and couponing. We did not call out anything on retail inventory relative to e-commerce. We never call out anything about retail or inventory. I would tell you if anything we could have gone the other way and said there's a little bit of pre-buy in Q1 for condoms. And so that impacted us negatively in Q2. But by and large that's you're right e-commerce is going to one-day shipping, there's a small impact maybe, but we would never call that out or call it material. Number three is international. Again, you're saying there is a deceleration. I would tell you maybe a slight deceleration, but again we just raised our outlook for the full year to 7.5%, right? So I think it's on the margin, I think those guys have proven time and time again that they're delivering in excess of the evergreen model, or outlook that we have for that business. And then the fourth one was commodities. The fourth one I think you're right. I said in Q2 that, there was about 370 basis points of inflation/manufacturing cost increases. We that's a big bucket in there, there's a big bucket of commodities, but there's also a big bucket of tariffs and really not having some prior year one-time benefit. There's also incentive comp in that number and labor increases. But as we move through the year, if we were up 20 basis points in Q1, up 30 basis points in gross margin in Q2, it implies that we're going to be up 135 basis points in the second half. That means, we're going to accelerate from where we're at 500 basis points and it's largely, because commodities are coming down, but other manufacturing costs are coming down as well. So I hope that gives you a little bit more clarity.
Andrea Teixeira: No. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. You maybe begin.
Mark Astrachan: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask your expectations for the material increase in marketing spend in the back half of the year. I don't want to get into guidance or thought on next year, but directionally when you've done this historically how do you think about kind of the flow through impact to the business? It certainly seems like given innovation cadence given spend that there's going to be some kind of benefits maybe just directionally without looking at any specific number for guidance. Is there any way to kind of think about things as we head into the first half of next year?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. We have an evergreen business model as you know, and so I've mentioned that earlier in response to Olivia. I mean organic growth of 3% and earnings per share growth of 8%. And that said we're going to get 25 basis points of gross margin expansion annually. But generally, the marketing is not a contributor to the operating margin expansion on long term. We generally, as Rick said earlier, we are around 11.7, 11.5, 11.9. We're in kind of a sweet spot. So if someone were to ask us, what do you think your marketing spend as a percentage it's always going to be next year, the year after, the year after that? We'd say, it probably between 11.5% and 12%. That's been working for us. As far as where we put the money? We got a lot of choices. We got -- we're in lots of categories and we have 12 power brands. So we are always focused on brand health. And one of the things I don't know Rick or I mentioned it, but we said that we do have more flexibility in the second half. We do intend to reinvest not just in marketing brand health, but also in R&D, for innovation. So lots of areas to go, marketing, R&D, analytics, automation, sustainability even cybersecurity. So we've got lots of places we'd like to put more money in the second half of the year, should that materialize. But -- we have -- I made reference to the fact, we're going to exceed our evergreen business model this year and that's important too. That's how, we drive the company long-term, how we drive total shareholder return?
Mark Astrachan: Yes, I guess, I was more thinking about the impact on revenue growth, just in terms of how the flow through the market -- incremental marketing spend would look. So, maybe if you have any sort of color on that? Then I just wanted to ask an unrelated question on international, just trying to figure out how the new market and distribution especially in Southeast Asia, China have gone so far. Maybe if you could talk a bit about brand acceptance kind of what you've seen so far in brands that are gaining most traction or have the distribution sign the product? That would be helpful.
Rick Dierker: Yes just a one liner on the marketing spend. When we spend incremental marketing, it just bulletproofs our evergreen model. So we hit or hopefully beat our evegreen model for organic revenue because of the incremental investments on marketing, yes that's what we hope for and potentially that's what we expect.
Matt Farrell: Yes. As far as the China and Southeast Asia, we're off to a really good start with Shanghai, Jahwa. That's a CPG company public company that we signed on with a year ago. And the categories that we entered China with are baking soda, toothpaste dry shampoo and -- some hygiene. By and large the acceptance is good. Two call outs in particular in Southeast Asia and also in China that would be water flossers and gummy vitamins. So they seem to be really a hit with the Chinese and the Southeast Asian consumer. So I think the strategy is working. We got -- I think China and Southeast Asia can be a big part of our story going forward.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Matt for closing remarks.
Matt Farrell: Okay. All right folks. So we had a terrific quarter and looking forward to talking to everybody at the end of the third quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead sir.
Matt Farrell: Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a few comments on the quarter, then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions. Q1 was an outstanding quarter for our company as we saw strong organic sales growth and gross margin expansion. Q1 reported sales grew 3.8%. Organic sales growth was 4.5%, which exceeded our outlook of 3.5% to 4%. Earnings per share was $0.70 which exceeded our outlook by $0.04. In the U.S., organic sales grew 4.5% with volume growth and positive price. Our categories are growing and our market shares are healthy. 10 of our 14 domestic categories grew during the quarter. And beyond category growth, our share results were solid with eight out of 11 power brands growing share. We continue to have success in the online class of trade, global consumer online sales continues to grow rapidly, and we expect it to exceed 8% of our sales in 2019. Our international consumer business delivered another terrific quarter with 8.5% organic growth. International is a growth driver and a bright spot for Church & Dwight. Unlike many of our peers, Canada, Germany, and our global markets group, which we formally refer to as export, had particularly strong quarters. Our new partnership with Shanghai Jahwa is off to a good start and it is clear that the investments that we've made in our international business continue to pay off. Now, turning to Specialty Products, Q1 was a challenging quarter for us with a 4.2% decline in organic sales. We are seeing lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers who continue to be hurt by low milk prices. So, in the short-term, we are less optimistic about a sales recovery in 2019. However, we still feel good about our long-term 5% organic sales algorithm as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like poultry, cattle, and swine. Now, let's go back to the U.S. business for a moment and call out a couple of the bright lights in the quarter. In household, the laundry category grew 1.7%. ARM & HAMMER laundry consumption was up 8.2% and gained 0.7 share points. As anticipated the promotional environment moderated a bit in Q1. We reduced ARM & HAMMER laundry percentage sold on promotion by 110 basis points, while maintaining growth and we plan to reduce promotional levels more in the coming quarters. Over in personal care, BATISTE continued to gain share with a 28% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category nearly doubling the category growth of 15%. BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 13th consecutive quarter. Now, let's have an update on pricing. Late last year, we raised price in several of our household categories in the high single-digit range. The impact on volumes so far has been better than expected. Over the last few months, we have had additional conversations with our retail partners regarding price increases in personal care category such as dry shampoo and condoms. These products are currently shipping with the new pricing. And finally we closed the FLAWLESS acquisition yesterday. We're excited to own the market leader in women's electric hair removal products. FLAWLESS is a fast-growing brand which complements our specialty hair care business. We expect it to contribute to our long-term growth both domestically and internationally and Rick will comment more on the impact of FLAWLESS to our 2019 outlook in a moment. So, in conclusion, we had a terrific quarter. We're feeling really good about the rest of the year and our evergreen business model is helping. Next up is Rick to give you details on the first quarter and the outlook for Q2 and the full year.
Rick Dierker: Thank you, Matt and good morning everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter EPS was $0.70 per share compared to $0.63 in 2018, up 11%. The $0.70 was better than our $0.66 outlook, primarily due to higher gross margin. Reported revenue were up -- was up 3.8%. Organic sales were up 4.5% exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 3.5% to 4%. The organic sales beat was driven by our global consumer growth of 5.2%. We're extremely pleased with our results. This is the third consecutive quarter of global consumer product growth in excess of 5%. Now, let's review the segments. First Consumer Domestic, organic sales increased by 4.5% due to higher volume and positive price and product mix, as we see the benefit of our price increases flowing through. Growth was led by ARM & HAMMER liquid, unit dose laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter, TROJAN condoms, XTRA liquid laundry detergent, L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, and BATISTE dry shampoo. ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent continues to grow sales and gain share while decreasing the amount sold on promotion. International organic growth was up 8.5% driven largely by FEMFRESH BATISTE STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent in the global markets group. ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and liquid laundry detergent in Canada, BATISTE in Germany, and WATERPIK in several countries. For our Specialty Products Division, our organic sales declined 4.2%. Although demand for our products continues to grow in the poultry industry, demand in the dairy industry continues to be challenged. Turning now to gross margin, our first quarter gross margin was 45.1%, a 20 basis point increase from a year ago due to price increases, volume growth, and productivity programs, partially offset by higher commodity and manufacturing costs. This exceeded our expectations, and you will hear later that we are raising the full year gross margin outlook. Moving now to marketing, marketing was down $1.8 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 9.4%, largely due to timing. But as you heard from Matt, both our share performance and net sales are strong. For SG&A, Q1 SG&A decreased 50 basis points year-over-year. And net operating profit -- the operating margin for the quarter was 23.1%. This represents 120 basis point increased over Q1, 2018. Other expense all in was $17.4 million, primarily driven by interest expense. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 21.9% compared to 21.4% in 2018, an increase of 50 basis points. And now to cash, for the first three months of 2019, net cash from operating activities was $137.6 million, a $17.6 million decrease from the prior year, as higher cash earnings were more than offset by an increase in working capital, that's largely timing-related. I'd like to take a minute and talk about our FLAWLESS acquisition and the accounting treatment. As you know, typically when we do deals, we buy the inventory on day 1. Based on the agreement, FLAWLESS will continue to operate the business during the transition period with their systems, which will last approximately four months. During this period, operating results will be recorded in the company's net sales line, impacting many of our metrics as we detailed in the earnings release. For the remaining four months, FLAWLESS results will be consolidated within specific P&L line items. So the total FLAWLESS impact on the company is, net sales is expected to increase by 200 basis points; gross margin increases by 20 basis points; marketing decreases by 10 basis points; and SG&A increases by 50 basis points. From a cash perspective, the expected increase in cash earnings 4% accretion is offset by a one-time inventory purchase at the end of the transition period and a onetime working capital build, which will be approximately $30 million in total. As a result, the full year effect of the acquisition on 2019 operating cash flow is neutral. Additionally, as previously discussed, there will be quarterly adjustments to the FLAWLESS earn-out, which will impact the P&L. These will be excluded from our adjusted results, but will impact the reported numbers. Now turning to the second quarter outlook, we expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 3.5%. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.52, 6% increase over last year's quarter. And now for the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to be approximately 3.5%. In terms of organic outlook by division, we now expect 3% for the domestic business, 7% from international and flat for SPD. We now expect reported sales growth of approximately 5% to 6%. We now expect full year gross margin to be up 50 basis points. This represents a 40 basis point increase from our previous guidance of plus 10. Half of the increase is driven by the previously discussed FLAWLESS impact, and the other half is a combination of Q1 gross margin, coming in better as well as the additional pricing actions, which will impact the second half of the year. While we were pleased to see first quarter gross margins above prior year, we still anticipate the impact of commodities, transportation and manufacturing cost to negatively impact gross margin. One example of this is surfactants where we saw a market pricing below prior year in Q1 with a forecast for double-digit increases for the balance of the year. As a result of the amortization and transition expenses related to the FLAWLESS acquisition, SG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be approximately 13.8%. We continue to expect 2019 adjusted EPS range of $2.43 to $2.47 per share or adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 9%. And as we discussed a month ago the FLAWLESS impact to EPS in 2019 is neutral. The gross margin expansion on the base business is being offset by a reduction on our share buyback activity as we stated we would do with a larger acquisition. And with that Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Erica Eiler: Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So I actually had wanted to touch on the promotional backdrop. I was just curious if you could elaborate a little bit more about what you're seeing right now on the promotional front? And do you still expect promotion activity to abate further this year?
Matt Farrell: Okay. In thinking about the promotional environment we're generally talking about household categories. So if you look at the laundry category and look at what the percentage sold on deal was year-over-year, it was down about 340 basis points. So it went from like 40.3 down to 36.9, so it's quite a drop. So the average for the category is 36.9. Where we right now for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry is 34%. So we were down 100 basis points year-over-year. So I -- it's quite a move down year-over-year, so I would expect that to be sustained for the rest of the year. And as I said in my opening remarks we expect also to reduce more in the next three quarters. The other category to pay attention to is litter. So on the litter category, you've Tidy Cats you've Clorox and Church & Dwight and all of those brands are down year-over-year as a percentage sold on deal. So the category is down 400 basis points. It went from 21.9 to 17.7. So down quite a bit. So as expected all -- it seems all the manufacturers have pulled back quite a bit on promotions. Recall that last year that everybody has experienced commodity increases and transportation increases big jump from 2017 going to 2018, 2018 going to 2019 not as bad, but still up. So this behavior is consistent with the ability of the suppliers to offset those cost increases.
Erica Eiler: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Bill Chappell: Thanks good morning. Could you talk a little bit just about what you're seeing on the commodity front? We've heard some kind of improvement on freight logistics. I mean though I know you still have some kind of lagging inflation that's going to hit you. I mean is the outlook getting any better there? Or is it pretty status quo?
Rick Dierker: This is Rick. Hey Bill. I would say that transportation as an example status quo. I think we said mid single digit increases for us last time we talked back in February and that's still our expectation. Like we've touched on many times we are largely hedged about 75% hedged for a lot of our commodities. That piece that does float, we have some capability in Q1, right? And I think I alluded to in my remarks that ethylene as an example was actually down year-over-year in Q1. Now the forecast has it going up in Q2, Q3 and Q4. But so far April looks lot like Q1. So I think we're optimistic that for the first time in a long time commodities were actually abating.
Bill Chappell: Got it. And just a second question. Trying to understand the liquid laundry environment, I mean are you still seeing maybe you expect it to abate throughout the year in terms of promotional levels? Do you expect -- I mean there's certainly one player in Europe that kind of comes back time and time again. So I'm just trying to understand how long you think this lasts?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Look in the first quarter even the company you referred to that's in Europe was down sold on deal. We can't predict what the competition is going to do, but this isn't just one quarter Bill. We've kind of started to see this trend in the second half of 2018 that's continued into 2019. So it's not obvious that, that is just going to turn around very quickly.
Bill Chappell: Okay. And then last one for me. Just I'm actually surprised that litter is everybody is down on promotion, because it seems to be a kind of a major battlefront for all the players with new introductions in pricing, and promotion, and advertising. Is that starting to abate?
Matt Farrell: When you have all these price increases you also have to keep in mind that people aren't going to dealing it back, right? So it's somewhat consistent that you're not going to see as much sold on deal. People want to see the price increases take hold and be able to drop it down to gross profit.
Bill Chappell: Got it. But you're not seeing any real change in the competitive environment on litter?
Matt Farrell: No. No, we're not.
Bill Chappell: Okay. Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: All right. Okay, Bill.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Yes. Hey, great. So I missed some of the statistics that you opened with Matt on the number of categories and brands that are growing or gaining share. Maybe just run through those again briefly, and just talk about some of the categories or brands that aren't in the green? Obviously, great results overall. But are there any surprises or disappointments that you tied at the category brand level? And if so, are they kind of according to plan more or less? Or are there pockets where you could actually see incremental improvement?
Matt Farrell: Yes. I think that the one day, I'm not going to get that question is when it's 14 out of 14, they're up.
Steve Powers: Correct.
Matt Farrell: It was 10 out of 14 the categories were up in the first quarter. Some of the categories that are struggling would be like condoms, for example. There are secular reasons for that for the last couple of years, because there are alternative contraceptives to condoms including Plan B and intrauterine devices, et cetera. Kids is down as well year-over-year, the category. I'd say those are -- that's also -- you could argue that that may be also related to birth rates. But I'd say on the sexual health side of the house is where we see some weakness. So that's probably where I would spend most of my time.
Steve Powers: Okay.
Matt Farrell: As far as the shares go…
Steve Powers: Yes.
Matt Farrell: …our power brands eight out of 11 grew share in the quarter. So, it’s spectacular. Last year we had seven out of 11 on a full year basis. So we feel great about the strength of the brands.
Steve Powers: Okay. Cool. And then you'd spent a lot of time at the Investor Day on that More Power to You campaign. Can you just talk a little bit about metrics measurements that you're tracking against that campaign? And just how they are -- how you're assessing the ROI there? And how that ROI is trending versus what your expectations were?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Well, think of it this way, Steve. We're just turning that campaign on right now. As I said, when we're down at the Stock Exchange that is going to be a multi-year program. I really think we've hit upon something that resonates with consumers. You're going to start seeing it hit in the next couple of months both on television as well as in print and digital as well, but this is something that we think is going to be a big boost for us, because ARM & HAMMER is across so many different categories. So it's laundry. It's litter. It's toothpaste, underarm deodorant. It's a phenomenal brand, because it trades in so many different categories. So this campaign is going to halo all of those categories. So hope to give you an update on that in future quarters to let you know how it's going, but it's only just kicking off right now.
Rick Dierker: Yes. And I would just add Steve, this is Rick, that it's always encouraging that when we're spending our lowest quarter of the year in terms of marketing spend to have the results that we just had. So that's another good indication.
Steve Powers: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is now open.
Steve Strycula: Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First would be on the personal care segment. I believe last quarter WATERPIK drove about 100% of the organic sales growth. Is that the case again in the first quarter of this year?
Rick Dierker: No. It's not.
Steve Strycula: Okay. So some of the other business did they get sequentially better? Would you mind commenting? And the second piece would be, should we think about since you're calling out surfactant costs being escalating this quarter, is that open negotiations for another round of price increases there? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Yes. So, really we did have some strength in a couple of different personal care areas. I quoted L’IL CRITTERS as an example. I quoted BATISTE dry shampoo in the release. So those are kind of leading the way from a PC growth perspective. I know WATERPIK was slightly positive, but the price increases and volumes kind of offset. Your second question was on surfactants and another round of price increasing. Well surfactants were actually – like I said ethylene was actually down year-over-year in the quarter. It's expected to be up in Q2, Q3, Q4 consistent to how it was three months ago when we gave our outlook. And we said, many times that we're not going to lead with any type of price increases in that laundry category. But what you're seeing in the laundry category is promotions being peeled back and you're seeing coupon reductions kind of what Matt was alluding to before.
Steve Strycula:
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Cody Ross: Good morning. This is actually Cody Ross on for Jason English, this morning. Thank you for taking our question. Sticking with the household products segment. This segment's revenue acceleration was exceptional this period even in the wake of some of your competitors announcing increased investment in your product categories. What do you think is driving your growth in liquid laundry? Why do you think you've been able to take market share? And given your recent market share gains are you expecting any step-up in competitive activity as the year progresses?
Matt Farrell: Yeah. We've talked about this many times before about the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent. You have to keep in mind that ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry is a value detergent. It's on the high end of the scale but it is a value detergent. And the brands that we compete against are Purex and Sun others and they are unadvertised brands. So we have a distinct advantage in the way we compete in that. Our brand has a lot of brand equity and those resonate with the consumer. Now, we've been growing the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent year-over-year for years. And this is – and we did – again, we grew this quarter quite a bit at the same time that we reduced our promotional spend year-over-year. So it's – and behind that we have the More Power To You campaign coming, which is also going to help us. So I think this is largely due to brand equity more than it has to do with promotions.
Cody Ross: Great. Thank you. And just to juxtapose that to your Personal care segment. This segment growth decelerated quite significantly despite the strength that you guys called out in BATISTE and WATERPIK. Is this all really your condoms slowdown? Or what else have you seen in the market in this segment that has caused the slowdown? Thank you.
Rich Dierker: Yeah, it's really two things. I think Matt alluded to the sexual health businesses being a slower grower. And then it's also our WATERPIK business isn't – we took a bit price increase and so volume elasticity has happened. And so the net result is the WATERPIK business has grown a little slower. So we think that's kind of transitory as the price increase takes hold, but that's what happened in Q1.
Cody Ross: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your gross margins they inflected positive in the quarter which is great. So hoping you guys could talk through your outlook for gross margins for the rest of the year and if any of the key drivers have changed here and just really now wondering if your guidance for gross margin could actually end up being conservative. Do you see more upside now?
Rich Dierker: Well, we hope so Bonnie. Remember, our outlook for gross margin when we met back in February for the full year was plus 10 basis points. And the detail of that back in February was, we were counting on plus 125 from price/volume mix, right? Largely as we're getting these price increases through on at that time 30% of the portfolio. We said we were going to have 100 basis points of improvement from productivity. We said we were going to have minus 190 for inflation and then minus 25 for the tariff. That's how we got to the plus 10 back in February. Now I'd say, there is really two small changes in our outlook. The base business, we would say is plus 30 basis points now not plus 10, plus 30 so the 20 bps of a change, 10 comes from better price/mix and volume and then 10 comes from a little bit lower inflation. So that's how you get to plus 30 and then the other plus 20 is really from the acquisition impact and the transition accounting. So I think we're off to a great start. We feel really good about it. We have plus 20 in the first quarter. We think we will be down slightly in the second quarter, first half is flat. Second half is probably up 100. So that's how we get to our 50.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question. I know it's a small business for you guys, but hoping you could drill down a little further on the pressures you're seeing in specialty products and then maybe what changes you're making if any to deal with the headwinds. And you mentioned, you don't expect much recovery, but you're going to be lapping easier comps in that business. So just kind of trying to understand if we should expect continued inorganic sales declines for the remainder of the year? Or you expect some kind of recovery possibly Q4? Thanks.
Matt Farrell: Yes. Just a little bit of color on the dairy market. So dairy price, the dairy industry is influenced by the price of milk. So if you look at class three milk 2018, it was pretty low. It was $14.60 per hundred weight, that's how it's sold 100 pounds. Q1 was even less than that it was $14.30. So dairy farmers are definitely struggling. If you look at last year, I mean 2017 going to 2018 there was a 7% drop in the number of licensed dairy farms in the U.S. The number of cows didn't decline so much they only declined 1%. So all those cows got distributed around to those other dairy farms, but that was the single largest drop recorded by the USDA. So obviously tough going right now for the dairy industry. What we've been doing is, we've been diversifying away from dairy over for the past three years. So last year what we said was that about 25% of our Specialty Products sales I'll narrow that sales of our animal productivity business 25% was for nondairy. So absent that we would have an even greater difficulty. If you went back three years 2015, 100% of our animal productivity business was dairy. So it is a worry for us obviously. But we think long-term and we know this is a cyclical business, so it does come back eventually. But in the meantime, we continue to expand the businesses that are directed towards cattle swine and poultry. For a full year -- on a full year basis, we started out saying I think we said 9% organic growth. That is not going to happen. I think it's going to be flat for the full year for Specialty Products business.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit about pricing again. Clearly, you're having very good flow-through and like you commented volumes have held in very, very well. I was just curious about I guess your perspective on some of the gross margin pressures that retailers are facing? And what that may mean in terms of sustainability in terms of pricing from an industry standpoint, not just Church specific. But given it's gone so nicely for you, I was just curious kind of how that's going? What you're seeing day-to-day? Retailers many are opting to absorb the price increases that you guys are putting through on a cost justified basis. But I just worry about sustainability for the industry. So anything you could offer there would be really helpful? Thanks.
Rick Dierker: Yes. Look I think we all know that retailers are challenged and oftentimes retailers have to turn to suppliers for some help with respect to their profitability. And different brands are in a better position to deal with those asks than others. And the reason we focus on having a number one and number two brands is so that when that conversation takes place that we can work -- we actually have something to bring to the party. And so if the retailer should say I need x then we might say hey, we need an endcap, we need to be moved up to eye level. When you're a number one and number two brand, you can have those conversations with the retailers. When you are the number three, four and five brand that's far more difficult. So I think those are the brands that are going to be far more at risk than the brands that are number one and number two. But what you described Lauren is something we've been dealing with for the last several years. You might say, okay it's going to become more acute now, if you raise price. But you would expect that some -- the penny profit for the retailer is also going to go up as well. So all of that profit is not winding up in our pockets.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay. All right. Great. And then just one more thing was on the vitamins category. There was a recent article in the journal, just about potentially increased regulation from the FDA over claims and so on. Anything that you've seen in terms of competitive activity in this space so far from some of the smaller players that might be facing increased scrutiny or changes in terms of retail shelf effect as there may be a different level of scrutiny on the category?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Hey we'd love to see that. I can't talk specifically about the journal article I don't remember seeing that. But when we bought the business it had a handful of competitors and today it's got 30. So we stand to benefit to the extent that there's going to be more scrutiny regarding disclosure and content of the gummy vitamins that we compete with.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thank you so much.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Olivia Tong: Hey, thank you. Can you talk about any change in your view on the makeup of your organic sales growth target just effectively in terms of price/mix versus volume particularly in Consumer Domestic? And then also a little bit in terms of how much of that price/mix is lower promo versus actual list price increases? And then were there any categories where promo didn't decline? Or potentially was up? Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Olivia, here Rick. A lot of questions there. First question was really just a split between volume and price/mix. For the company we said it was for Q1 about half 50-50. For the domestic division it was 1% volume 3.5% for price/mix, so maybe 25% -- 75%. I would expect that trend to continue throughout the year. I think that's a good ballpark. Second question was maybe some other categories that weren't being promoted as much. Was that it?
Olivia Tong: Yes.
Rick Dierker: What I would just say...
Olivia Tong: Sorry. Just if there were any categories where promo didn't go down or it was actually up?
Matt Farrell: Yes. No the big ones are -- we went through earlier we did look at the liquid laundry detergent and litter those are the big ones. Personal care side of the house is less driven by promotion it is far more driven by a marketing. So that's generally not a topic for conversation in personal care.
Olivia Tong: Got it. And then in terms of international I know it's not as big. But on price/mix there I know it's an elevated comp in Q1, but given the FX moves like I guess I was a little surprised to see that it was down year-over-year. So can you talk about what's driving that? Is that trial building? Is it just a mix of businesses? Anything else there to call out?
Rick Dierker: Well, no you hit it on the head. More than anything it's a comp issue. If you look at that business it was -- price/mix was positive 5.2% in Q1 in 2018. For the year it was 2%. So if you just, almost at the stack bar if you had the stack up in Q1 5.2 minus 1.7 is 3.5. So that's 2% to 3% is right where that business is usually at for price/mix. So it's more of a comp issue back in 2018. We did have some favorable price/mix as we were exiting and had to reverse some charges from our China venture. So it's really just a comp issue.
Olivia Tong: Got it. And then just lastly in terms of Consumer Domestic obviously a lot better than you had expected specialty worse but net-net you'll obviously not be changing, you're maintaining your full year total company expectations. So can you just update us in terms of your expectations by segment from the full year basis?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I did it in my prepared remarks. But just to do it real quick again. Previously we had said for the full year back in February we said 2.5% domestic, 6% international and 9% for SPD that's 3.5% organic. Now we're saying 3% domestic, 7% international and flat for SPD to get to the 3.5%.
Olivia Tong: Got it. Thank you so much.
Rick Dierker: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Joe Altobello : Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.
Rick Dierker: Hey, Joe.
Joe Altobello : I have a question on the pricing that you guys took in dry shampoo and condoms. I believe that's incremental to your prior guide. So is there any EPS impact from that? And was it cost justified? Or was it more innovation-driven?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I'll take the EPS question Joe. It's -- it was, every single price increase that we talk about has to be cost justified in this environment. So it was cost justified to answer the first question. In terms of gross margin if you exclude FLAWLESS because sometimes it's just easier to think of it like that let's just strip out all the noise and FLAWLESS, we would've raised our gross margin from 10 basis points to 30 basis points of improvement right? So that 30 basis points is made up of partly the new pricing that we got in the back half of the year for these personal care categories. We would've stayed at 10 basis points down for marketing would have stayed at 30 basis points of leverage for SG&A and we would've been 70 basis points of op margin expansion. And you say, okay, where do that flow through for EPS? Well, remember, back in February, I said, if we did a larger deal, we would take our $300 million buyback program and just do $100 million of it and that's what we did. So EPS is neutral, but operating margin is higher.
Joe Altobello: Okay. So it's just the lower share count, effectively. Secondly, just out of curiosity, Amazon going to one-day delivery for Prime members. Does that have an impact you think on the industry in terms of e-comm sales? Or do you think same day is really the game changer that has to happen?
Matt Farrell: I think, yes, it's a game changer. I think, everybody just going to have to move towards one-day and maybe same-day at some point in the future. I think that Amazon just keeps turning up the heat on all the bricks and mortar retailers. So that will be a competitive advantage for them until such time as others catch up. Now it may not matter to some consumers at some point that whether you get it same day or next day. But the option -- having the option may matter to people. But it's definitely something to watch, something we're watching closely too, Joe.
Joe Altobello: But does it help you get to 10% faster, for example?
Matt Farrell: 10% of online sales?
Joe Altobello: Of total sales, yes.
Matt Farrell: It's -- I don't know that's going to get us there. Whether it's two-day or one-day, that's going to change consumer behavior as far as buying online. We were up 40% year-over-year in the first quarter, our online sales. We got a big jump. So we're easily going to pass the 8% for the year. So we're all happy with the direction we're going and the skills that we're developing to compete digitally and online.
Joe Altobello: Okay, great. Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Okay. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So can you comment on the performance of the non-tracked channels? I believe the gap of growth had narrowed last quarter and Rick spoke to that on the Analyst Day. But it seems that it accelerated again this quarter. How is the rate of growth for e-commerce and club? I know just in context of one of your competitors gaining more shelf space in laundry at some -- at one of the clubs. And just trying to seize the 3.5% organic that you called for the second quarter is, just be more conservative as you just printed 4.5%? I mean, just trying to -- because the tone about pricing and positioning into the second quarter has been I think more benign than what we heard from competitors. And also a modeling question, if I can, just ask on the mechanics for the revenue recognition for FLAWLESS, because the old operator is still operating it. So I don't want to think -- it's not going to go, obviously, in organic growth. I was just wondering how to account for the different divisions and how it would be accounted in growth. Thank you.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Let's start with the tracked and untracked channels. So if you look at our -- if you look at Nielsen, our consumption growth would have been around 4%. Unmeasured would add about 1.5% or 150 basis points. We had really strong growth in e-commerce, as Matt alluded to, and other untracked channels as well. That would get offset, though, by couponing of about -- around 70 basis points and all other around 30 basis points. So that will take you to the 4.5% organic that we're talking about. You also alluded to just a deceleration in Q2 for organic growth and really through maybe the back half of the year. Well, remember, we are pulling back on promotions as we've talked about many times as we go through the year. So that does have an impact on volume. But we feel like we're in such a good spot that we can do that. Your third question was on FLAWLESS. And that was related to helping on the divisional breakout. We're not ready to do that yet. This is -- we just closed yesterday. We're dealing -- and I -- we try to go into a lot of the detail on the -- kind of the transition portion of FLAWLESS for four months and then when it goes through every line of the P&L for four months. And the best guide we can give you right now is, plus 200 basis points or so to net sales for the company.
Andrea Teixeira: And that is implying the 15%, kind of, run rate of growth for that business?
Rick Dierker: It is. We said that business was $180 million trailing. If you times that by 15% you get low 200s. Divide that by 12 months times it by eight months, since we closed on May 1, that's around $140 million. That's around 300-and-some basis points. But remember, the funny accounting is that, we could only recognize the operating profit and net sales for the first four months. And so it's really less than -- it's around half of that. So we can go through it in more detail if you like offline. But it's -- that's why it's less than maybe what you think.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay, perfect. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to go back to the specialty segment. So I get some of the moving parts behind it. But I'm curious about just the dramatic change in expectations from February to now. What does it kind of say about the visibility that there is in the business? And does some of that incremental volatility perhaps make you, I don't know reconsider the segment itself? Or accelerating the change away from cattle to other animals, other categories within that? And you've talked about it, but it doesn't seem like it's enough to potentially stem some of that volatility.
Matt Farrell: No, the way you should think about that business is, it's got mid to high 30s of gross margins. And so it's moved up quite a bit over the last few years as we have made acquisitions into other categories. When you say, hey you went into the year looking for 9% and now you're looking for flat, some of the things that informed us about 2019 were; A, the milk prices would be recovering. There are some industry estimates that come out, that predict what -- essentially what they are milk futures since they predict what milk prices are going to do in the back half of 2019. We're less optimistic that that actually is going to happen right now. The other thing that's hurting the business is the tariff war. So, for example, China is the number one importer of whey protein from the United States. So, obviously, that's depressing milk prices. And as the NAFTA-2 still hasn't been ratified, so that -- all those changes haven't wound up helping the dairy farmers. So looking at that now in April, we're saying, we feel more like it's going to be flattish for the year. But long-term we still feel good about the business because we are effectively making the move diversifying away from dairy.
Mark Astrachan: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And also wanted to go back to the prior question on the retailer dynamics and the puts and takes of the pressures that they are dealing with. Perhaps help us in reminding how the businesses have trended or how the pricing dynamics have fared in historical periods where input costs are lessening as price increases or accelerating but the underlying inputs are actually becoming a bit more benign. So is there any chance that the retailers push back a bit more on price or that some of that is given back in the form of increased promotions going forward? So anything there certainly based on historical views would be helpful.
Rick Dierker: Hey, it's Rick. I'll just correct one thing. Commodities are not abating right now, right? Commodities are up year-over-year. We said Q1 for ethylene as an example was a little bit favorable to what our outlook was. But that's it. In general commodities are up significantly still from 2019 to 2018. So that's -- in this environment -- and oil as you guys know is back up to around $64, $65 a barrel. So that's not what the narrative is right now. Price increases are happening because of commodity inflation that's existing out there.
Matt Farrell: Yeah, abating doesn't mean going backwards. But look these things move like glaciers over time. So what you're talking about is at some point if commodities now go in a down cycle and then what happens? Well, what happens historically is it creates a price umbrella and it gives suppliers the ability to promote. But we're a long way away from that.
Mark Astrachan: Thank you.
Matt Farrell: All right. I think that's it folks. Hey, we had a great quarter, sales were up, gross margin expanded and we'll talk to you all at the end of the second quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-06 12:00:00) =====
Matthew Farrell: Thanks for coming. We have a lot of familiar faces here today and we have got a great program planned for you. I am going to start off with the Safe Harbor statement. I encourage everybody to when you have some time take a look at it and read it. And I have a very packed agenda. Many of these topics are familiar to you, who we are, why we are winning and take you through the ARM & HAMMER brand today, also all our exciting innovation in ‘19 and then our other couple businesses, international and animal productivity. I will also talk about how we run the company and Rick will come up and talk about the financials. So, we just wrapped up another strong year. And we entered 2019 with a lot of confidence. So, our EPS is expected to increase 7% to 9% driven by operating income growth and that is top tier in the CPG space. Our 3.5% organic sales outlook is above our evergreen model. All three businesses are healthy. In the U.S. we are enjoying strong demand for our products, we are in the right categories and we have low exposure to private label. Our international business continues to be a juggernaut and we will hear more about that today from Steve Cugine who leads our international business. Our Specialty Products business is also setup for a good year. We have an impressive lineup of innovative products across many categories that you are going to hear about today and our ability to rapidly innovate is differentiating among CPG companies. In 2019 we are going to return to gross margin expansion as we have price and productivity programs at our backs. Our price increases have been well executed for ARM & HAMMER cat litter, baking soda and carpet deodorizers and OXICLEAN pre-wash additives. Those price increases hit the shelves late in the quarter and will benefit 2019 gross margins and the good news is the competitors are raising price in those categories as we speak. And we have other levers to bolster 2019 gross margin expansion and those include pricing in personal care categories and also an opportunity to reduce promotions in the laundry category. So, before we get into the formal program, I want to recap a few reasons why we are a standout in consumer products. We have an evergreen model which leads to two things, consistency and financial literacy. We delivered top line and bottom line growth year after year after year. The shareholders know the model very well and so do the Church & Dwight employees, all 4,700 of us. We all know what success looks like. With only 4,700 employees, we are a lean company and we adapt to change quickly. There is no better example of that than the growth of our online sales. We succeed, because our employees are committed to our success. We have brands consumers love and today you are going to hear from Britta Bomhard, our Chief Marketing Officer, you are going to hear about ARM & HAMMER and the More Power to You campaign. The More Power to You campaign is a shining example of our brand building skills. And finally, we made good choices when it comes to acquisitions. Those choices led us to dry shampoo, hair thinning, gummy vitamins and gum health. Our acquisition experience and skills will serve us well in the future. We believe there is no better place to invest in the CPG space than Church & Dwight. Alright. I will get into the formal program. Who we are? Well, the evergreen model is 3% top line, 8% bottom line. It’s been like that for many years and will continue in the future. The way the 3% breaks out is we expect 2% from the U.S., 6% from international and 5% from Specialty Products. We have 11 power brands that are listed on the slide there and those 11 brands account for 80% of our revenues and profits. And we have a very balanced portfolio between household and personal care, household 45%, personal care 48% and Specialty Products bringing up the rear with 7%. And we also have a nice balance between premium and value, 65% premium, 35% value. And we are an acquisition platform. We have a fabulous integration track record. When we buy businesses, we grow revenue and we bring operational efficiencies and because we have a strong balance sheet, we have a lot of access to capital to do more in the future. And we have a long history of growth through acquisitions. So what you see in that slide there is 15 years. So we went from $1.5 billion to $4.1 billion. So out of those 15 years, 12 out of the 15 years, we completed a transaction. And 10 of our 11 power brands were acquired since the year 2001. And when you have leading brands, it gives you the ability to take price. So, you read in our release that we are taking price on 30% of the portfolio and we are having discussions about other categories to add to that. And we have very clear acquisition criteria. Number one or number two brands, they need to be high growth, high margin. We are fans of asset-light businesses and we like businesses where we can leverage our existing supply chain. And finally, these brands need to have a sustainable competitive advantage. So, 11 brands today, 20 brands tomorrow. And we do operate in the land of giants. All of our competitors are far, far larger than we are. As I said earlier, we only have 4,700 employees. That gives us a huge advantage. We are a lot faster than they are. We can make decisions quicker and we adapt to change. You have heard us say before. Change is our friend. And we deliver phenomenal results to our shareholders over any period you want to pick, 1, 3, 5, or 10 years. So, why are we winning? First is this scorecard. So here is 2018. So we have algorithm, we grow 3% top line we grew 4.3% top line 2018. The consumer business had a phenomenal year, United States 4.3%, international 7.8%. Combined that was a 5% growth rate for our consumer business in 2018. Specialty Products had a rugged year, but that’s going to turn around in ‘19. Okay, we are in the right categories. We know how to grow share. Low exposure to private label and we win in e-commerce, so some stats. So here is 2015, ‘16, ‘17 and ‘18. You can see in general our categories grow about 3%. That’s the underpinning for the growth in the U.S. And we know how to grow share. So this is our share scorecard. In 2018, 7 out of our 11 brands maintained or grew share. And we have low exposure to private label. So if you went and calculated what’s the weighted average private label share for our categories it’s around 12%. And out of those 15 categories you saw on that earlier slide, 5 of them have exposure to private label, but if you take a look at those five charts, you can see that the shares are relatively stable. And we continue to win in e-commerce. So let’s look back at 2015. 2015 we were in the basement. We had 1% of our sales online. Today we are 7%, grew 40% in 2018. So, now we are top tier in CPG when it comes to online sales. We are expecting to hit 8% in 2019. And we have lots of number one brands online. Amazon generally is about 50% of online sales for most CPG companies. It’s very important class of trade. All of those products are rated there number one. And now I want to bring up Britta to take you through the ARM & HAMMER campaign.
Britta Bomhard: Hello, everyone. As Matt just talked about, we are all about brands, consumers, love. And how we bring that to life, I want to share with you today. You have heard we have 11 power brands and I think about a year ago when I was here, I shared actually what we are doing on OXICLEAN. You might remember, it’s been a whole year I know that we talked about how we activate in digital and how we do targeted marketing and predictive analytics as one of the key tools. And as you know, we are all about transparency and results. So, Matt loves to talk about our report card. So I thought I would share today the results of the year of OXICLEAN. So what you can see behind me is OXICLEAN had the highest share ever at more than 53% and we have actually grown 4x the category. So that’s what great marketing can do for brands. And today we are actually here to talk about our biggest and most exciting brand, ARM & HAMMER. And I know that I want to refresh briefly what you should know about ARM & HAMMER. It is one of the oldest brands in the United States. It was actually one of the first ones trademarked in 1905, which gives it more than 100 years. It is truly part of the American DNA. So one of my colleagues was actually in a museum in Utah and on the wagon displays of the wagons going west, there was a baking soda box, because the versatility of that product is so ingrained in American philosophy about making yourself a brighter future, but it’s not only a historical brand. Even today one in two households buy an ARM & HAMMER product every year and I hope all of you are part of that and you over index. So baking soda, just to put it into few fun facts and what it actually does in America. So, one of the first things I want to talk, we all know the juice for cookies. If you used all the baking soda last year to make cookies, you would actually get up to 688 billion chocolate chip cookies, but it’s not only used for baking, you might be aware that it’s used for cleaning and refreshing. So it actually filled 31 billion gallons of swimming pool water. And the third exciting usage is it also has medicinal usage. So, 300,000 patients in the U.S. rely on ARM & HAMMER baking soda to purify their blood. It is such an essential product for this nation. And obviously, the one you should all be most familiar with is half of fridges in the U.S. are actually kept fresh with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. And in case you missed yours, there is a few baking soda to grab on the tables, remember to refresh every 30 days. It’s not only baking soda. In other categories, it is such a key brand in this country. So if we put all our laundry together and only wash white T-shirts, we would actually get 62.5 billion pounds of laundry. Now I know that’s a hard number to imagine, so I thought I would give you an easier one to imagine, how many elephants would that be? 6.5 million adult elephants. Now, I know you all imagine adult elephants everyday, so I thought maybe you just imagine the whole of Manhattan Island covered with elephants. That’s about how much laundry is done with ARM & HAMMER laundry every year. So needless to say, it’s our $1 billion brand, our biggest and our crown jewel, so I think we are very excited to share how we keep this iconic brand going to work in the future. In the past, we have been very much communicating about the benefits and how it is better and the superiority of the product, but we are actually leaning in much more on connecting with our consumers in an emotional way, because we are all as I said about brands, consumers, love. So a new campaign which you hopefully at least saw coming in or experienced somewhere here is called More Power To You. And even if I call it a campaign, you really should think about a unifying creative idea, which is going to go and last us for years towards the future. So, what’s the base idea behind More Power To You? Well, no brand would exist today without the love of the consumers and what we are celebrating is actually the true power for ARM & HAMMER is the ingenuity of the people using it. So, we are elevating our consumers to the heart, because they are the ones, which make this brand great. So, let me talk you through what that feels like and what’s the emotion around it. So if you can laugh over spilled milk, More Power To You. If you work a 60-hour week and still get the kids to school looking fresh, More Power To You. If things get gross and nasty, don’t panic, you have the tools to make it right, More Power To You. That’s why we created powerful products stacked with solutions to tackle everyday’s challenges with strength and a smile, More Power To You. Now I know this is probably not your usual what you see, but I think I want to show to you how our consumers took to this in a big event where we launched the campaign here in Bryant Park. And we asked our consumers what they were thinking about ARM & HAMMER. So, let’s go to the first video. [Video Presentation] So I think the video gives you a little bit of a flavor what this experience of experiencing ARM & HAMMER is like. But actually, I think when we say we celebrate the ingenuity of our consumers, they are our celebrities and where would you find celebrities, obviously, in People Magazine. So we highlighted our consumers as our celebrities in an edition in People Magazine in January to just show how important they are to us. So everybody you see here are real consumers as everybody you see on the wall here or as you see on the banner outside. But not only did we celebrate them, we invited them to share their experiences of baking soda, so they are telling the world about their unique experience or how they use it and we are amplifying that in our media. And more than that, we make it even easier to connect with ARM & HAMMER. So if you want to connect today, we will have QR codes on our products, which lead you immediately to either the usages or participation in the campaign. And if you haven’t had yet the opportunity to test it, you will see on the right all these banners with QR codes, so an easier way for you to get that experience yourself. That will allow us to tell this rich ARM & HAMMER story in such a bigger way than just a couple of lines on the packaging. If you remember, there is more than 101 usages for baking soda. No box will ever be big enough to print all of them. So, these new medias are God sent for us to actually invite people into the ARM & HAMMER brand and educate even more. So with that, somebody asked me earlier, we will have about 40% of our ARM & HAMMER spend on digital, because we find that it’s a fantastic tool to interact in a two-way communication with our consumers as well as make sure we target them the right way. But we also and I want to show you similar to what I showed in OXICLEAN a year ago, how this campaign ladders up for different target groups on the example of laundry. And hold your breath because nobody else has seen these campaigns yet, so you are the first one. So I want to show you the versatility of this creative idea with three very differently targeted executions for laundry. Let’s start with the first one. [Video Presentation] So if you have sensitive skin like me, you know this yucky feeling. I think this is a great visualization of what this looks like. So, this is clearly in the direction of elevating a benefit. But we also know that a lot of Americans are actually strapped for money and so we also know that we are one of the best value brands out there to doing your laundry. So we actually target those people with a different message, which I want to show to you now. [Video Presentation] So I think those two executions already show how versatile this campaign is. And we also have more emotional executions, particularly for those of you in the room who are parents you know what the strain of parenting can be. So I hope you enjoy the next campaign, which actually leads into that emotion of bringing up the family. Video? [Video Presentation] So I think you have experienced now the ability of this campaign all laddering up to More Power To You in targeting very different segments of laundry users. But as you know, ARM & HAMMER is much broader. It’s one of the brands with most different aisles in the U.S. So, we also have cat litter. So you might wonder how we bring this to life in cat litter and you are in for a treat. [Video Presentation] So it sounds like we have couple of pet parents in the room. So as you know, pets are often today are kind of treated as persons and children. So, I think by personifying the cat, that actually gave great emotional resonance, so we have excellent test results in that commercial. And as you can see here, it’s a unique way and we can own and breakthrough to a lot of boring cat litter communication. So I think it’s a very unique way for us to communicate and own a message in that category. So nothing works like experiencing a campaign. Instead of me telling you about it, I think what you want to do is be part of it. And as you haven’t yet, we have a box setup there to get your picture taken and know what it’s like to be part of the ARM & HAMMER community, because obviously, there is More Power To You. So thank you very much and join us on that campaign.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Thank you, Britta. Now we have got some really exciting things to talk about. I mentioned earlier that we have quite a scale as an innovator in CPG and I think this little show here is going to give you a real pace of the breadth of the innovation that we have in 2019. We will start off with Waterpik Sonic-Fusion. So we have the world’s first flossing toothbrush. Now you can brush and floss at the same time and only 16% of American adults floss daily. And this is clinically proven to be twice as effective as traditional brushing and flossing. So, this is a fabulous new product. And there is a lot of science behind this. So I am going to roll a couple of minutes here. So everybody can appreciate the design behind this product. [Video Presentation] Okay, gang. Everybody run out there and buy one today. Alright, next up is OXICLEAN. So we all know OXICLEAN for its whitening powers. But now we are launching OXICLEAN Dark Protect. So this is directed towards dark and black fabrics. So 42% of our wash loads are dark loads. So we are bringing anti-fade technology to OXICLEAN and it includes OXICLEAN Stain Fighters, it’s cold water soluble. This keeps dark and black fabrics looking newer. And we are also bringing that technology to value detergent. So, ARM & HAMMER plus OXICLEAN Fade Defense. This is for vibrant whites and bright colors. So, color fading is the number two laundry frustration. So this is a new benefit, Fade Defense that we are bringing to the value detergent category. Litter, so we have ARM & HAMMER Cloud Control, so you can breathe easy. If you are a cat owner, you know there is a cloud of nasties when you are emptying the litter pad. Now you can breathe easy with no cloud of nasties when cleaning the litter box. So this is dust-free, it’s got dandruff control technology, and an allergy-free light scent and we still have our 7-day odor-control guarantee. In vitamins, we are coming out both for VITAFUSION and Li’l Critters with organic vitamins, USDA organic. So a couple of proof points here, 50% of Americans now consume organic products at least occasionally. And millennials, more than half of millennials prefer supplements derived from organic sources. So we are giving consumers more of what they want and less of what they don’t want. So we all know that facial masks are the rage. So, NAIR is coming out with a NAIR leg mask. This is the first mask for legs that not only beautifies skin, but also removes hair. So when you ask facial mask users, 86% are interested in purchasing or using a mask for legs. We think we have a great insight here. We are going to run an ad right now so you can get a better appreciation for this. [Video Presentation] Okay, next would be oral care. So we are coming out with ORAJEL toothache strips. So we have patent pending on this particular product. This is where you are going to get targeted long lasting pain from strips that you apply to your toothache. Our strips stay in place for targeted relief, they dissolve slowly for long lasting relief and a cool mint taste. So, this is really a revolution for oral analgesics. BATISTE. BATISTE is a fast growing brand for us globally. We have two new variants coming out this year, one is a hydrating dry shampoo, the other one is volumizing. So a couple of proof points here. So, 80% of women don’t wash their hair everyday and only 24% are currently using dry shampoo. So, why is that? Well, it’s because some of them think it’s not for their hair type. So, we have a hydrating dry shampoo for dry hair with moisturizing avocado and volumizing dry shampoo for fine hair with plumping hair collagen. So, these are going to be two winners in 2019. It wouldn’t be an Analyst Day without TROJAN. So here is the TROJAN Edge, take pleasure to the limit. This is with lubricants to change sensations. Gen Z as we all know places a lot of value on experience, adventure and living boldly and to reach that crowd, we have a new TROJAN man. [Video Presentation] And no one in this room is in the target group, so you haven’t seen any of the digital ads, but I encourage you to look for them. Okay. Now, I am going to bring up Steven Cugine to take us through the international story.
Steve Cugine: Well, it certainly is a big sexy world. So I guess that’s why I am up next to talk about the international story. As Matt said, I think everybody is familiar with our evergreen target international at 6%, but I thought I would give a little color here on international. For the last several years, we have been focusing on building scale. As you can see in 2013, we were $430 million in sales and we exit 2018 with $710 million in sales. Not only have we increased scale to the point where we believe we can really have access to every major market around the world, we have doubled our organic growth on a much larger base from 3% to almost 8% and exiting 2018 at 7.8%. When we started this journey, we started really implementing our new strategies in 2014. We saw the fruits of that labor by Q4 and you could see from every year from 2015 to 2018, we have exceeded our 6% evergreen growth target exiting 2018 at 7.8%. Even better news is we had a very strong quarter finishing Q4 at 9%. So, we leave 2018 with a lot of momentum. The net sales composition for international is really 8% Mexico and Australia; 23% Europe, which is made up of three subsidiaries, France, UK, Germany; Canada at 31%; and total export or our global markets at 28%. Breaking that down for 2018 even further, our subsidiaries delivered a solid 4.3% organic growth and export continues to deliver strong double-digit growth every year. As we look forward and we say where is the engine of growth coming from? And what is the fuel for that growth? In our subsidiary markets that now exceed $0.5 billion in sales we focus growth in three areas one, brand expansion, that’s expanding the offerings of the brands that we offer today like OXICLEAN Ultra Gel entry in Mexico, where we entered the liquid segment; VMS expansion and of course, BATISTE, Matt talked about the great new products, but we are also expanding in new subsidiary markets. Last year, I talked about how excited I was about the acquisitions that we recently made and that I thought Waterpik represented a real engine of growth, not only for the company domestically, but for our international business. Now I am happy to say that international delivered 20% growth in the Waterpik business in 2018 versus year ago. Lastly, pricing, so in 2018, we have initiated pricing actions over a third of our products that we sell in our international markets and we will reap the benefits of that initiative in 2019. Another example for growth for the future is Asia. Last year when I was here I talked about a spotlight on Asia, both Southeast Asia and China and I am pleased to be here today to say that our sales exceeded $90 million in these markets in 2018. That is up from $25 million in 2013. This is enabled by a new relationship that we started in 2018 with DKSH, a partner of ours covering all of Southeast Asia. This year, we are implementing an initiative to really drive and expand our distribution in all of these markets through this partner. Another exciting development is China. I personally spent almost 2 years in studying the China market and doing consumer research in every major city in China on our brands, identified those brands, took that research and identified partners that would really expand the China opportunity for Church & Dwight, but there are several characteristics that were very important. We needed a company that had certainly the traditional distribution access into retail, because it’s certainly a big part of the China market, but also had already developed a strong capability on e-commerce. This is something that even local Chinese companies are struggling with in terms of the dynamic change in this marketplace. So, we identified Shanghai Jahwa, which is a strong personal care, CPG company, $1 billion in size, publicly traded company, to be our partner in this market we spend a lot of time with them getting to know them and ultimately negotiating a very unique agreement, which gives us both transparency and access to the online and offline markets in China. Beyond this, I’m excited about the capabilities that we’re building to drive long-term growth in our international markets. We have established local teams in Shanghai and in Taiwan. In Shanghai, our employees of Church & Dwight are actually embedded with and live and work with the Jahwa employees in their corporate offices. So, they’re really fully integrated into the Jahwa team to support sales, marketing, and operations and distribution in the China market. We doubled our staff in Singapore and Panama. So, we’re investing in the markets where we see the fastest growth. We built a DTC capability in Europe and Australia. As you know, we launched a new subsidiary in Germany last year, and that’s off to a fast start. We’re also committed to brand building, both in our developed subsidiary markets as well as in our export markets. And so, we have customized talent for each market and I just I’m going to share with you a brief snippet of some of our assets. [Video Presentation] Okay. So last slide, we are committed, certainly myself and the international team, to deliver at 6% or more for international organic growth, and I’m pleased to put this slide up in particular because it is the identical slide that I ended with last year because what was true then remains true today. Our existing brands still have a lot of runway and we look at Batiste and its growth in the international markets, ARM & HAMMER baking soda and ARM & HAMMER related products that were premiering today continue to deliver strong organic growth in our international markets. Our acquired brands are building strength too. As I mentioned Waterpik growing 20% in 2018. Our export business has been and will continue to deliver double-digit growth. We’re making significant investments in Southeast Asia and China, and that will fuel growth for years to come. So, it is certainly a big sexy world out there, and I’m pleased to represent Church & Dwight’s international business. Matt, back to you.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Animal Productivity, so we have a 5% algorithm here. Remember we said that the Company grows 3%, U.S. is 2%, international 6% as Steve just took you through, and Specialty Products 5%. So, you might think, hey, that’s kind of a big number considering that we went backwards in 2018 minus the 3.4%. Here’s how that 5% breaks out. So, we have a bulk chemical business. That’s essentially bulk sodium bicarbonate. It’s a real steady-Eddie business. Animal Productivity is the one that we expect to grow at 6%. Two-thirds of the businesses is Animal Productivity; one-third is bulk chemicals. Now the Animal Productivity part of the business is the one that’s been most volatile and the most cyclical over time. The reason we like being in that space is just because of this statistic is there’s 7.5 billion people on the planet today; going to 10 billion by 2015. So, animals have to be more productive. If you went back to the 1970s, that’s when we first got into the dairy business. Essentially baking soda was Alka-Seltzer for cows. They could pretty much eat more and more grass. From there we moved into nutritional supplements, still in dairy. And then 3 years ago we decided we have a great brand in ARM & HAMMER. We can move into other species; that will be cattle, swine, and poultry. So first we bought into pre-biotics, then we bought into probiotics. So now today, 2018, 24% of the business is non-dairy and growing. This is good for us going forward. Second thing is that 13% of the business is now international. So, the population growth is outside the U.S. That’s where we need to be. So, we’ve made a lot of progress over the last three years and that’s what gives us confidence in the 5% top line long-term. So just as Steve said, the same slide this year as last year. We have a great brand. All of these products are labeled ARM & HAMMER. The consumer trend is away from antibiotics. So, we make prebiotics, probiotics, and nutritional supplements. And we’re not wedded to dairy anymore. We’ve moved into other species, and the global growth and the growth of population is going to help us. So, this is going to be a winner for us, and this business has terrific financials. Alright. Then how we run the company? First off, you heard from Britta today, we have number one brands we have brands that consumers love. We also are friend of the environment. We leverage people. We have highly productive people and we want Church & Dwight to be a place where people matter. And we leverage our assets heavily. And if you do all four of those well, you get really good returns. But because we are an acquisition platform, we deliver great shareholder returns. If you look at how we’re incented, it’s very simple; net revenue, gross margin, cash from operations, and EPS, 25% each and all 4,700 employees understand it. I want to particular gross margin is 25% of all employees’ annual bonus. If you look at our numbers for 2018, you know we’re pretty sad about that. So we’re going to turn that around in 2019. These are the four ways we do it. So good to great cost optimization. That’s our continuous improvement program. We have supply chain optimization as well with our plants. New products we have accretive new products. All these products you saw today are premium priced and acquisition synergies. And with respect to being, a friend of the environment, in the early 1900s, we started to use recycled paperboard in our packages. In the 1970s we were the only sponsor of the first Earth Day. We were the company that took phosphates out of laundry detergent in the 1970s. And more recently, in 2018, a 100% of our electricity globally comes from renewable sources of wind and solar. And we planted 3 million trees through the Arbor Day Foundation last year. Why do you plant trees, because trees take CO2 out of the atmosphere. So, we have three goals. One of them is we want to reduce the use of water by 25% by 2022 that’s water. Second is solid waste recycling. We want to move from 67% to 75%. And here is the big one. We intend to be carbon-neutral by 2025, and today we are 55% carbon-neutral. What does that mean? That means we take out of the atmosphere a little bit more half of what we put in the CO2. And we’ve been getting recognized for that; Barron’s, Forbes, FTSE, the EPA, Drucker Institute WSJ Management Top 250, all of them recognizing the efforts we’re putting into this. Alright. Now financials from Rick, come on up.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Alright. Thanks, Matt. I am going to go through three things, look at the 2018 results, quarter, full year, talking about the outlook, and will start with evergreen model like we always do. So just as a reminder and we have been doing this for over 10 years, but organic net sales growth of 3% is kind of our algorithm, 25 basis points from gross margin, flat marketing, higher dollars of course, and then leverage SG&A by 25 basis points to get to the 50 basis points on operating margin, which translates into 8% EPS growth. I’m sure all of you guys can tell me the same thing. And as Matt alluded to earlier, it breaks out by division, 2% domestic, 6% international, and 5% for SPD. So, Q4 highlights; 4.3% organic growth in the quarter, which is really strong top line performance. Our outlook was 3%, domestic was 4%, international was 9%, and SPD went backwards by around 4%, consumer organic also almost a 5% grower. Adjusted gross margin; now this is where we’ve had a lot of conversation. Our full-year outlook was down 120 basis points that implied down 160 basis points. In the quarter we finished down 250 basis points in the quarter. So, what happened? Three things; first of all, there was a mix impact of about 40 to 50 basis points. Our household business grew faster than we expected. Our personal care business, excluding Waterpik, grew a little bit slower than we expected. And so that was one. Number two was tariffs, so the timing of tariffs, right. As our Waterpik business grew faster, we thought that tariff impact was going to really hit ‘19. It got pulled forward into 2018 and then the third thing was on gross margin. We really blew the doors off of cash from an incentive comp perspective. We missed on margin, but we really blew the doors off the cash flow, free cash flow conversion. We’ll get to that in a minute and so gross margin has an impact. Incentive comp has an impact on gross margin. Marketing was up 10 basis points. So, we invested $5 million or $6 million year-over-year in marketing really to start the year with momentum, which is actually happening, right. I think Nielsen information came out today, plus 6% on consumption growth, so really starting off the year strong and EPS was up 10%. So for the quarter 3.8%, 4.4%, 4.7% and 4.3%, so just really strong broad-based growth across the year, on a stacked basis, the second half of the year was around 8%, alright, so just growth on top of growth. This is probably the most important slide or one of them in the deck. This is our progression on price/mix. Remember organic has two components. One is volume growth and one is price/mix growth. And for a long time, we were bumping along in the negative price/mix growth, for about a 1.5 year. In Q3 we inflected, right. And lower promotional spending, especially in laundry, and positive price/mix happened in Q3, happened again in Q4. Now remember in Q4 list price changes that we’ve gone to retail with aren’t even in these numbers yet, right, because it takes it typically protects a month or two months or even three months sometimes retail pricing, and so really that benefits on the come in Q1 and for 2019. I already walked through the details of Q4, but I’ll just recap gross margin for the full year. So plus 20 basis points on volume, price/mix, down 170 basis points for commodities and transportation, and we’ve talked many times about the headwinds on commodities, whether it’s resin, oil, diesel, surfactants, the headwinds in the industry on transportation, and we’ll talk little bit more about that in 2019 outlook area. And then other manufacturing costs, whether it’s tariffs or incentive comp or labor increases. Productivity program was plus 80 basis points and then FX and acquisitions was, really immaterial, so that’s down 140 basis points for the year. For the full year 4.3% growth, down 140 basis points for gross margin. We just spoke about that. Marketing was strong, 11.7%. SG&A was a good baseline of 13.6%. EPS was 17%. And I think too many times we look past our EPS growth. So, 17% EPS growth, and yes, we had some tax reform benefit in there. Our peer average was about 5.5% apples-to-apples. So, we’re just we feel like we’re top tier performance here. Cash from operations was $763 million and free cash flow conversion was 124%. You’ll see in our slides later on cash, the peer average is 91% on free cash flow conversion. So, just doing a great job of converting those sales and earnings into cash. Okay. Moving to the outlook, so 3.5% organic sales. This is the highest organic sales outlook we’ve given since 2014. Gross margin is expanding 10 basis points. Excluding tariffs, it’s up 35 basis points. And I’ll walk you through that detail in a minute. Marketing is down 10 basis points, but that’s really just math. Our SPD growth is around 9% for next year. We, don’t advertise to the dairy industry that much or to cows. So, it doesn’t have much marketing. So, it’s just math. Our marketing dollars are up year-over-year. SG&A is down 30 basis points as we leverage pretty much in line with the operating model and 50 basis points expansion for operating margin, 21% effective tax rate. So, 2018 we were at 21%. In 2019 we’re at 21%. That’s two things; one is stock option exercises and the other one is favorable tax matter internationally. But the good news is its flat year-over-year and so that means what does that mean? It means our EPS growth is all operating in 2019. Cash from operations is around $800 million is our outlook. So again, really just strong free cash flow conversion. And it’s not on the page, but the assumption for buyback is about $300 million, $100 million of which we’ve already done. And, of course, if we do an acquisition, we would probably dial that back and just focus on using that money for M&A. Here’s the detail for the organic sales outlook, 2.5% domestic, international was 6%, SPD was 9%, that’s how we get to 3.5% as a baseline. Okay. I want to spend a minute on this slide. This is gross margin expansion in 2019. This is the key part of our story in ‘19. Really two things to call your attention to, in 2018 we are only plus 20 basis points for price, volume, mix. In 2019 the net benefit of price, volume, mix is 125 basis points, so this is plus 100 basis points largely because of the retail price increases. The other thing I will call your attention to is inflation. So it was a 250 basis point headwind in 2018. It’s another headwind in 2019, although not as much, 190 basis points. I think there is a false narrative out there about commodities and how quickly they came down and the – maybe favorability that they are throwing off. As an example, in Q3 to Q4 oil was down about 30%. A couple of key commodities that we had diesel, resin, surfactants, they were down 4%, 7% and 13%. And so it takes a while and you have heard this from many of our peer set. It takes three months, six months, nine months for oil to be down for the rest of the inputs to really fall at the same rate. The good news though is what Matt alluded to is we have certain pricing actions, those four that Matt already talked about embedded in our outlook, but there are other pricing actions for personal care items that we are working on and that would be in addition to our outlook. Productivity programs is plus 100, we are making great traction on our good to great program and then the tariff impact is minus 25 basis points. So remember, we have talked about this briefly, but we price to protect profit dollars and not margin. So that’s largely the Waterpik tariff impact. And while we are protected from a profit dollar perspective, it still has an impact on margin. And so net-net we had a 10 basis point increase from a – on a reported basis and then if you add back the tariffs, we are at plus 35 basis points. So we feel really good about margin expansion for 2019. And here is some color on some of the key P&L items. So organic growth, we have had a great track record of organic growth and we are ahead of our evergreen model in ‘19 at 3.5%. Gross margin, I just went through that in detail. This is a hallmark of the company and Matt told you how much it’s important to the entire company, 25% of our incentive comp is tied to gross margin. Nobody else in the industry really does that. Marketing spend, we are still in the top 20 advertiser in the U.S. and dollars were up. And it’s essentially flat year-over-year. SG&A management, this is a great baseline for us we are leveraging back down to 13.3% in 2019. Now if you exclude amortization, a few years it looked like we are building SG&A. That was really tied to some of those smaller deals we are doing and all the amortization that we are throwing off. So if you take a step back, you can see the trends pretty flat over time. We have had great adjusted EPS growth over the last few years and we expect ‘19 to be no different. So 7% to 9% EPS growth in 2019, which is top tier in the industry again. I think the peer group when we did a list of about nine or ten peers, on average it was around 1% or 2%, okay. Strong margin expansion over time, gross margin matters for this company. Gross margin drives EBITDA margin. EBITDA margin drives cash flow, we believe that drives valuation. So just a great progress on and we expect more to come. Free cash flow conversion, this is my favorite slide, 124% for Church & Dwight, peer average is 91%, lot of companies target 100%. And we do that a few different ways, but one of them is working capital management. We have gone from 52 day cash conversion cycle all the way down to 20 days. And we have a very strong balance sheet. We ended the year about 2.2x levered, we will be sub-2x in 2019. And what does that mean, well, especially when we are under-levered, capital allocation is very important. But number one far and away is M&A. Number two is debt reduction because it enables number one. Number three is new product development. Number four is CapEx. Number five is return cash to shareholders. So we have a lot of firepower, $2.5 billion is our math and we can maintain our investment grade rating. And we are not a capital intensive company. We are about 2x or sub-2x typically on CapEx. We have announced a 5% dividend increase in 2019. This is strong track record of dividend increases and we have been paying one for 118 years. And I think Bill Chappell had to leave, but this slide was specifically for Bill because he came in late a couple of years ago. Our TSR is 20% over 10 years. It’s about 18% over the 3-year and 5-year horizon and it was 33% in 2018. And with that, I think we have a public service announcement before we start our Q&A. [Video Presentation] Alright, so I am going to invite up the rest of management team and we will go through our Q&A.
A - Matthew Farrell: Okay. We have got the whole squad coming up here, every function is represented. There would be chance to pepper us with questions, so we got a microphone for the crowd.
Rick Dierker: Yes.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Joe Altobello.
Joe Altobello: Thanks. Couple of questions on gross margin, I guess first for Rick, can you walk us through why the cash flow over-delivery was a drag to gross margin in the fourth quarter?
Rick Dierker: Yes, sure. The question is why is cash flow over-delivery from an incentive comp perspective a drag to gross margin rate, right. Well, we have 4,700 employees, two-thirds of whom are at the manufacturing facilities all over the world. And so when you do incentive comp or salaries, that goes through direct labor or overheads at the plants. And so increases in compensation flow through the gross margin line as part of COGS, so that’s why.
Joe Altobello: Got it. And secondly in terms of the ‘19 outlook for gross margin, what level of promotion activity you are expecting, is it going to get better than it was this year or worse than it was this year or pretty much equal?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. One of the things I have said upfront is that we see an opportunity to reduce promotional spending in the laundry category. If you looked at two big household categories right now, so if you looked at laundry detergent and litter and you looked at the last six quarters, you see that the fourth quarter was the lowest quarter in 1.5 year. Unilaterally we think because the strength of our brands and the strength of the consumer that we can go further.
Joe Altobello: Okay. Thank you.
Matthew Farrell: Kevin?
Kevin Grundy: Thanks. My question is on the international business, how big can the China opportunity be, what’s potentially the role of M&A with respect to that growth strategy. And then lastly, touching on that with the guidance that was the one segment where you are guiding in line with the evergreen target, but it seems like this would be a year with the – with your alliance Jahwa coming on where maybe we would see above sort of evergreen target growth, but that’s not at least initially anticipated in the outlook, so maybe you could touch on that as well? Thank you.
Matthew Farrell: It’s never enough, Kevin is it. We have got a 6% algorithm. We said we are going to hit the 6%, but…
Kevin Grundy: [Question Inaudible]
Matthew Farrell: Yes, okay, alright. Well, I am very curious to hear what Steve has to say about how big the international business can be particularly in China.
Steve Cugine: Okay. So put it in perspective, right. So outside the U.S. for Procter, China is the number two largest country. For us, it represents about 1% of total sales. So it’s a very significant opportunity for us. So we believe that we are putting in the foundation for what I think is a decade, maybe two decades worth of growth, right. To maintain a 6% plus algorithm, you are going to need to have some large markets contributing for a long period of time. So how big can it be, I think it can be pretty big, but I won’t put a number on it today. We are just starting with Jahwa as of Q1 in ‘19, so we would like to get a little momentum under our belt. Your second question was on why only 6% growth and I would say there is two reasons for that. First is that we are investing both in Southeast Asia and in China, right, particularly in terms of expanding distribution. That is a net negative against organic sales. If we looked at a unit basis, we think there would be faster growth, but we are really ceding that for 2020 and beyond, that’s number one. And number two we are being just a little cautious as it relates to Brexit. So we have a large manufacturing plant in the Southern UK that supports a lot of our international personal care brands.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Jason.
Jason English: Thank you for the question. Two quick questions, first on cadence to gross margins, obviously we finished on a slightly softer note, can you give us any directional indication of what the shape of it may look like throughout next year? And then second question, I will just plow them both in now. Can you update us on your M&A ambitions? I know a lot of observers of Church & Dwight had a sense that there maybe acquisitions coming sort of late last year. Clearly, we are into the next year and nothing has happened. Is there reason to have a heightened sense of anticipation that there is something happening sometime in the near-term?
Matthew Farrell: I am going to let our attorney answer that second question. So I will take the second question first. So you know that there is no property that is sold in the United States without us being aware of it. So any book that’s floating around, we have it. So we look at everything that comes to market, but we never tip our hand with respect to what we are going to hunt for or if something is imminent. But rest assured, we are very busy looking at opportunities, so that’s as far as we can go. Patrick, are you good with that? Alright.
Rick Dierker: And then your second question on gross margin just the curve, largely because of commodities it’s, I’d say, first half, second half. So the first half will have to be down on gross margin, the second half will be up on gross margin, because of the timing on commodities.
Matthew Farrell: Okay.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. So, following up on a question on guidance and a question on international for Steve, on the guidance 2.5% consumer domestic growth, your commentary was very bullish on pricing and optimistic on lower promotion, some of that 2.5% price mix versus volume, should we expect that to be skewed significantly more towards price mix? If so, how do we square that and the flat A&P against the backdrop where just a couple of your competitors, Henkel and Colgate are reinvesting pretty significantly? Maybe not all the funds in the U.S. market in your categories, but they are investing. P&G is not relenting. So is your spending outlook enough and the price mix optimism, how do you square that with the investment backdrop competitively? Secondly...
Matthew Farrell: Do you want to pause there and let us answer that?
Unidentified Analyst: Sure.
Matthew Farrell: So one of your questions is we have some competitors talking in high-pitched voices about they are going to be investing more money, whether it’s P&G or Colgate or Henkel. We don’t view this as something new. These guys have been spending lots of money the last few years. So I don’t look at this as a sea change. So Henkel, for example, yes, they bought a business a few years ago and they got bigger in the U.S. Obviously, they want to make a big splash into premium laundry and they have with Persil. They have less than a 3% share today. They do have other brands in the mid-tier and in value, but we have been winning in value for the last 2 years and it’s not from them lack of trying. Our share of laundry today is 15%. 2 years ago, it was 14.1%. So we have had huge growth in the last 2 years and it’s defined everyday. So we don’t really view this as something we got to sweat. If you go back to Henkel and mid-tier, one of their brands is all. Two-thirds of all is a sensitive skin consumer. That’s not the lion’s share of our brands. So obviously, it’s something we are going to watch. I would imagine OXICLEAN liquid laundry will get knocked around a little bit up in the premium tier, because of average for Persil, but that’s not something that we think is going to influence our 2019 results.
Rick Dierker: And I would just add to your question on volume versus price mix, probably two-thirds price mix and one-third volume is a good kind of general direction. And then in terms of why you are growing faster is kind of the crux of the outlook on revenue. And 3.5%, we think is a great number relative not just to our history, but also relative to the peer set. We are not going to go lead with a 4% growth when the rest of peers are growing 2%. So is there conservatism, maybe but 3.5% feels right at this point in time.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. This one will be quicker. Just on the international horizon, thinking long-term, at what point you are leading with a lot of export-led, distributor-led growth, at what point, as you realize that, do you foresee organically you need to step up like cash investment in those markets to really build your own infrastructure versus going on the back of distributors? Is that something that’s within a 5-year time horizon or is it going to be just more even keel as you go forward?
Steve Cugine: Yes. Today, I would say Church & Dwight is 82% sales in the United States, right. We have a big world and that’s why I was joking. I don’t know who put the TROJAN spot in before me, but I really do believe passionately that we have a lot of runway for growth before we really need to put in kind of big assets. And the big assets are usually around SG&A frankly if you’re going to go direct, and we have a model that we prescribe in terms of the size of the business and the percent of SG&A required to make that math work. It works in Germany, but – and that’s really just because there are a few large customers. So, the SG&A as a percentage of sales makes the math work. In other countries like China, we said we’re never going to be able to get to the scale that would be required that say P&G has been able to do over decades of time. So, we’re taking that partner route and we’re going to do that in most of our markets. But what we’re doing is we’re attacking that market through a brand building partnership approach for large markets. And in that case, we see that playing out for years to come. So even in the 5-year timeframe, I think we have a lot of runway in the current model that we have structured so far.
Rick Dierker: I would just add to that, it’s also a pay-as-you-go model. I mean, these guys are doing a great job. We’re not calling out of our EPS or investment like we’re spending millions of dollars in China, that we spent millions of dollars going direct in Germany. That’s embedded in our outlook of 7% to 9%.
Matthew Farrell: Let’s stay with the same table.
Olivia Tong: Thanks, Matt. Appreciate it. Wanted to talk about pricing. The 30% of the business that you’re planning to price on, are those price plans already in market? If not, when are they coming? And then also are your peers, have they announced their pricing plans? And just on gross margin, mix, tariff, these are kinds of things I think that they’ll continue. So, why does it get better from here?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. So, with respect to pricing, when we say 30% of the portfolio is price that’s across all three businesses. It’s U.S., International, and also Specialty Products. Within Specialty Products, it’s the bulk sodium bicarbonate driven by rises in soda ash. As far as announcements go, yes, they have been announced. The 30% has been announced globally, and one of your questions was have competitors moved in the U.S., the 30% they all moved. So, it’s still early days. This is just a measure of price elasticity, but we’ll be watching out over the next 3 months to 6 months.
Rick Dierker: Maybe you want to – Paul, do you want to comment on just the volume elasticities in just early days?
Paul Wood: Everything – generically speaking it’s always tough to take price anywhere, but those are progressing as expected and similar to Matt’s. The price elasticity, the volume, mix that we put on has been positive. As expected, we’re making progress. So, we’re going into this – these are always tough conversations, but I think no surprises and going exactly as we expected and planned.
Rick Dierker: Yes, great. And then, Olivia, your second question was on gross margin and mix continues and tariffs continue. I already talked about tariffs, right. Tariffs are implicitly in there, but we’ve already priced those. Those prices are effective already. And so from a profit dollar perspective, we’re protected, right. If those roll back then great. From a mix perspective, this was a year that we just missed gross margin in a big way, right. I was here a year ago and I told we were going to be flat and then commodities came in a big way, transportation came in a big way, and mix came in a way. So, we planned 2019 a little more conservatively from a mix perspective. So, I feel pretty good up here in February talking about it.
Olivia Tong: Got it. And then if I could just pivot over to SG&A, obviously that’s a big bucket of your operating margin delivery for 2019. And SG&A has actually been going up as a percentage of sales the last couple of years. Obviously, last year you got the tax benefit that you put back into the business, but what’s going to drive that SG&A improvement for 2019?
Rick Dierker: Good question. Three things, one, and this is just consistent with our evergreen model. I’ve said it many times. If we can grow our SG&A dollars at half the rate, we can – we grow our top-line. That’s worth about 15 basis points, okay? We’ve done the math there many times. We get about 15 basis points again just from incentive comp, right. Again, we really blew the doors off the cash, and so that is going to be a benefit year-over-year in 2019. And then the third thing, we’re really – working really hard on systems and automation, whether it’s the quality system, whether it’s our PLM system for R&D, our SAP system or whatnot. All these systems that we put in place so that we don’t have to add people that we get more effective and efficient that way. So those are the three reasons.
Matthew Farrell: So, here’s a fun fact. So, we have just about the same number of employees on December 31, 2018 as December 31, 2017. And we expect to be the same way December 31, 2019. So, we’re a really lean shop. And one of the beauties of that is it forces the Company to prioritize. We can’t do everything. So, we just focus on high-value activities. Who’s next? Let’s come forward here.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. So, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the Nielsen data. For the first time actually the fourth quarter kind of tracked the Nielsen data and usually you would be – we are aspired to see you’re growing faster than that. So, I was wondering, if there is an indication of like the gains that you had in distribution in off-track channel kind of like easing off? And kind of related to that also, Amazon, you mentioned that 50% of your e-commerce now is through Amazon, which does make sense in terms of like share. But like there’s a lot of sampling talks about Amazon asking for more support from the manufacturers. So, I wonder if embedded in your guidance there is also some investment within e-commerce?
Rick Dierker: Yes, I’ll take the first one. So, the question is organic versus what Nielsen would say. So, I think organic for us is 4% for consumer domestic, Nielsen was 3.9%. And you’re right, typically we’ve had around, I don’t know, 100 basis points of a tailwind from untracked channels, whether that’s online or club. It was 150 basis points this quarter, so that 4% – 3.9% plus 150, right, becomes 5.40% 15 [ph] and then we had incremental couponing that was already in place 6 months ago for Q4 around one of our laundry brands. And so that part brings it back down because coupons are not in Nielsen. So that brings it back down as well as some SRAs, sales returns and allowances back down to 4%. So that’s how you get there. It looks like it’s the same, but there’s really two moving pieces.
Matthew Farrell: Britta, you want to take a swing at the Amazon?
Britta Bomhard: Sure. I can talk about investment in Amazon. So, I think with all our marketing investment we actually evaluate efficiency. So, Amazon’s part of the mix, and from that we read rather how effective it is. We don’t do it like specific by any retailer ads. It’s much more about what can we achieve in total results.
Andrea Teixeira: [indiscernible].
Britta Bomhard: Of course, at Amazon, I would say what you will see is that effectiveness in their advertising, if you go on their sites, the search engine has been improving. So, with that, yes, we are investing with Amazon in line with the results we’re getting.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Nik?
Nik Modi: Yes. I have one question with 11 parts. Just on the business, I’m just looking at slide number 25 with some of the businesses, the power brands have been struggling. Matt, maybe you can just give us some context on what the challenges are, so we can kind of think about 2019 and some of the drivers?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, which – you’re looking at this slide with the 7 out of 11?
Nik Modi: Yes. So vitamins, XTRA, SPINBRUSH, ORAJEL?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, okay. Yes, generally, investors are only interested in things that are red or that can hurt you. So, we would generally say 7 out of 11 is a win, that’s a high five year.
Nik Modi: High five. Got it.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. So, let’s just bound through them. So, vitamins, for example. So the vitamin category you know when we bought the business, it had 6 competitors, now it has 30. So, it’s very cluttered right now. We continue to grow our consumption year-over-year, but we’re just not growing as fast as the category. What’s happened is that a lot of the pill brands are now moving to gummies. Net they’re about standing still, but gummies is growing faster, right, than the pill category. So, consequently, it looks like we’re losing share. But we’ve been happy about our growth. We grew at 6% consumption in 2018. So, we feel good about that. What’s the next one?
Nik Modi: XTRA?
Matthew Farrell: Okay, so XTRA, XTRA has been in decline for a number of years up until this year. So, this year we’re just slightly – a slight decline in 2018. So, we – actually that is a good story for us. That one almost turned green. We almost got to 8%. So that’s terrific and one of the reasons that has done better it’s because of our Odor Blasters campaign. We brought Odor Blasters into the XTRA story.
Nik Modi: Okay. And then just on ORAJEL and SPINBRUSH?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. SPINBRUSH has been a tough one for a number of years, again a cluttered category. That’s where we shipped 40% of our units in the fourth quarter. There’s a lot of competition from Colgate, Crest, others. There isn’t a really great story. It’s not that big a business, but we’re still the number one battery-operated toothbrush, but it’s very competitive. What’s your last one?
Nik Modi: And ORAJEL?
Matthew Farrell: ORAJEL. You want to take ORAJEL?
Britta Bomhard: Sure. So first of all, I have to extend more love to XTRA than actually Matt has done. I think if you look at the laundry category in total in the different price segments, XTRA competes in a very value-priced tier. We’ve actually done significantly better than anybody else in that segment. And as I said, we were so close to being flat. It was minus 10 bps in market share in the end of the year. So, I think that’s a tremendous improvement and if you look at total laundry, an absolutely success. So sorry if I think there is a little bit more passion behind XTRA and we love this brand. Secondly, I would say on ORAJEL. You might have seen it. We had an FDA change of mind regarding benzocaine and teething products and that has had an impact. We are the number one in teething and in young kids, and as we had to withdraw from that segment that’s why you’ve seen a decline. But all our other ORAJEL businesses, so we have canker sore, you’ve seen the new strips, and the kids toothpaste are doing very well. So, that’s actually, as you know, sometimes regulation can be surprising.
Matthew Farrell: Nik, I didn’t hear you thank us for providing that scorecard so that you could ask that question. Okay. Anybody else? Here Caroline.
Caroline Levy: Sorry for the repetition, but can we go back to gross margins, because I think going into the fourth quarter, we saw great sales trends, and we were definitely surprised as it sounds as if you were by the margins. My understanding then is more people in the Company are incentivized by cash flows and by gross margin. Is that what affected the pay?
Rick Dierker: Yes, no, what I’m saying is and Matt said, we have a simple incentive comp program, 25% each, but when cash flow maxes out because of great working capital management, the P&L expense for that is split between SG&A and cost of goods sold. And so it’s only 10 basis points or 20 basis points really. I mean, we’re going through to – maybe 20 basis points on the gross margin impact from higher incentive comp.
Caroline Levy: Okay. And then on the pricing, you took your pricing up, but the retail price hasn’t gone up, but your income statements affected by what you get from the stores? So, can you just explain on that?
Rick Dierker: Right. So we – but typically in industry if you protect, you price protect for the retailers for a period of time, right, because they have their own pricing policies of, yes, you can do your announcement, but you’re going to protect me for 30 days or 60 days or 90 days, right. And so what we’re saying is there was a price protection program even to our pricing to retailers, but that’s all labs and so in Q1 and going forward, it’s a new retail price.
Caroline Levy: Was there forward buying in the fourth quarter, so the volumes – 
Rick Dierker: We don’t let – I mean you limit the amount that can ever happen, it’s an immaterial amount. We limit the amount our retailers can order when you have a pre-buy for pricing.
Caroline Levy: Okay. And then if I might, on the WATERPIK. Is WATERPIK lower than average margin to the Company at the gross level?
Rick Dierker: No, it’s not. Gross margins are on par with the company. Now with tariffs, it’s a few 100 basis points lower than the company margin, right, but normal operating – normal gross margins are on par with the company.
Caroline Levy: So to the extent – and this is my last one, but to the extent that household continues to grow faster plus WATERPIK grows faster, that’s just a negative mix shift that – 
Rick Dierker: Well the household business, WATERPIK rolls up in the personal care business, but when the household business grows faster and if the WATERPIK business grows faster with tariffs, then that’s a negative drag on mix. But we were conservative when we planned 2019 was my earlier comment.
Caroline Levy: Got it. Thank you.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Lauren, you’re next.
Lauren Lieberman: Thank you. So first, I just wanted to continue on WATERPIK. I was curious if it’s possible to shift sourcing for WATERPIK to outside of China, so you can just get around the whole tariff issue to begin with? And on top of that, I just want to be clear because I think last quarter when you talked about pricing plans on WATERPIK, I just would have expected it to hurt so much this quarter because the plans were in place and it was discussed. So, is it that your retail partners or your distributors kind of was a longer period of price protection, there was maybe some buying ahead of that pricing going into place that really kind of threw the balance off, because it feels like a lot of the gross margin shortfall in the quarter was related to the dynamic of tariffs and also WATERPIK?
Rick Dierker: Yes, let me answer the second one first. And really Steve Cugine’s Group is doing a great job with WATERPIK, right. They had explosive growth internationally. We’re not changing the price of WATERPIK internationally. But when you have explosive growth internationally and sales are higher than you expected, then all of a sudden, the tariffs which you thought were going to be in inventory are now flowing to the P&L. That’s what happened.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay.
Matthew Farrell: And your other question is with respect to sourcing, so, I’ll let Rick take a swing at that. The short story is, this is a fairly sophisticated product. So, it’s not something that’s easily moved nor do we have plans to move it. So right now, we’re planning on riding things out, but maybe see Rick can give you a little more color on what’s involved at the plan?
Rick Dierker: Yes. So we have a great network of contract manufacturers making the WATERPIK products and we’ve been working with them for a number of years. We are exploring other alternatives outside of China, but as Matt said, it’s a complicated product and we don’t want to jump the gun on that given that the tariff situation is pretty dynamic right now, but we’re doing our homework, so that if they’re here to stay, we will have some options hopefully.
Lauren Lieberman: And then I just had one more on gross margins. The long-term algorithm, everyone else had like seven questions. So, the long-term algorithm though for gross margin, I just want to talk about kind of some of the contributors because in terms of what’s growing fastest in your portfolio, International, SPD, right, temporary hopefully the tariff situation, retail environment arguably only getting tougher and tougher in the U.S., all these components. Like why is 25 basis points kind of the right algorithm going forward? And also in terms of the closer in promotional environment, you definitely cited the continued more rational environment in laundry as being contributing to your outlook for ‘19. But at the same time, we know you’ve got Henkel with very, very clear objectives. I know you talked about nothing’s changed. These guys never step back. But the numbers are big what they’re throwing around. And again, if we’re talking about promotion being lower and a positive contributor in the near-term, why isn’t that something we should be worried about changing course as we go through ‘19?
Matthew Farrell: Look, whenever you build a plan, you build some flexibility, so you have some bullets to fire if something different happens. So, of course, if there’s something unforeseen that happens, we’ll react to that. But I don’t have anything to add to what I said earlier about what our expectations are. We actually think we can pull back further on promotions in laundry in 2019.
Rick Dierker: And the other thing that’s kind of under the radar, but we put a slide up about it was how much progress we’re making with our productivity program. It was plus 80 basis points in 2018, plus 100 basis points is the outlook in 2019. We’re in the early days of reinvigorating our productivity program with incremental dedicated resources in R&D and supply chain. So, we’re doing things that give us the flexibility, the degrees of freedom so we can confidently say 25 basis points is the evergreen model.
Matthew Farrell: So while we have a robust continuous improvement program, it’s just that in ‘17 and ‘18, all the cost increases from – ‘18 I should say, outran whatever we could do with continuous improvement. And there was another step up this year with costs, but not as much. It was 250 basis points in ‘18, I’d say 190 basis points negative in ‘19. But as Rick said, we’ve got a lot more juice in continuous improvement, but not enough to overcome that next year. So, pricing is what gets us over the hurdle. But we still see plenty of runway in future to become far more efficient as a company.
Rick Dierker: Okay. Alright, last one.
Lauren Lieberman: I just had a quick follow-on on the pricing what you just mentioned. If I understand it correctly, you have pricing in the market on about 30% of your portfolio and then you’re considering doing more pricing. Is that a decision you’re going to be making in the next few weeks or months or is that more of a second half decision when we can expect to see more pricing going in the market?
Rick Dierker: Yes. We’ve said – we’ve said in the release, we’re already talking to retailers about categories beyond the initial 30%. As far as when that would hit, we wouldn’t be able to disclose that. But those conversations are happening right now and particularly in the personal care categories.
Lauren Lieberman: Would it be then more than half of your portfolio in terms of the discussions you’re having right now in terms of price increases?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, we’re not prepared to say. We will update everybody in May. Okay. One more question. Okay. You’re the absolute last. Okay Michael, what have we got?
Michael Steib: Thank you, Matt. It’s a marketing question. It’s about the millennials. Could you share your thoughts about that particular group of the population and specifically what behavior are you observing that are helping you, hurting you, or what are the bigger trends that will affect us over the next 3 years to 5 years?
Britta Bomhard: Well, that’s a very philosophical question. So first of all, question is how many of you have millennials in your household already? So first of all, I would say what do we see. I mean, we’ve all heard about it. Maybe a little bit more sheltered lives early on later moving out and forming their own households, a little bit more, how would I say, media consumption very different. I think we’re showing how we’re responding to that in all our different avenues. Overall, I see nothing, but opportunity for us. I think millennials are great, because it gives you opportunity to have a dialog with consumers going forward. And as I would say, we are very fast, agile at adapting, that works in our favor.
Matthew Farrell: Okay. We’re going to pull the plug right now. Thanks for coming today, gang. We’re very enthusiastic about 2019. We’ve got a lot of confidence in delivering our plan. Thank you all for coming today.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk, uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a few comments on the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions. So Q3 was an outstanding quarter for our company. Q3 net sales grew 7.2%, which reflects both strong organic sales growth and sales from prior year acquisitions. Sales growth is clearly a powerful earnings lever in an environment with rising input costs. Organic sales growth was 4.7%, which exceeded our outlook of 3%. Global consumer organic net sales have accelerated sequentially over the last five quarters, as price mix continues to improve. And this performance was a clear standout in comparison to our peers. Earnings per share was $0.58, which exceeded our outlook by $0.05. In the U.S., organic sales grew 4.7% with both volume growth and positive price. Our categories are growing and our market shares are healthy: 11 of our 15 categories grew during the quarter, 9 categories have grown for at least four consecutive quarters, and beyond category growth, our share results are solid with 7 out of 11 power brands growing share. As we have said in the past, we have low exposure to private label, about 12% share on a weighted average basis. Now we're having success in the online class of trade. Global consumer online sales continue to grow. And we continue to expect it to exceed 6% of sales in 2018. With respect to the promotional environment, 8 of our 11 power brands had a lower percentage of products sold on promotion in Q3 compared to Q3 2017 and still we grew. And this is the second quarter that we've seen this. And we don't expect that to change in Q4. Our International Consumer business delivered 8.3% organic growth. As you know, International has emerged as a growth driver for our company for the past four years. International markets are a bright spot for Church & Dwight, unlike many of our peers. Canada, Mexico and export had particularly strong quarters. The investments that we've made in new leadership, regional hubs, and our brand focus continue to pay off. On August 29, the company entered into a long-term cooperation agreement with Shanghai Jahwa, a respected and well established local Chinese CPG company. Shanghai Jahwa will be the exclusive omni-channel distributor for four of our categories, and they would be baking soda, toothpaste, dry shampoo and fem hy. And this is in Mainland China. This is an important step in our Asia-Pacific strategy. And we're very excited about the partnership, as Jahwa has demonstrated the ability to build strong brands for themselves and other CPG companies in the past in Mainland China. Our algorithm is 6% annual organic growth for the International business. And we expect to meet or beat that number in 2018. Now turning to specialty products. Q3 was another challenging quarter for us with a 3.3% decline in organic sales. And this of course reflects lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers, who continue to be hurt by low milk prices. However, we still feel good about our long-term 5% organic sales algorithm, as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like cattle, swine and poultry. Now let's go back to the U.S. business for a moment to call out a couple of the big consumption winners in the quarter. In household, ARM & HAMMER detergent reached an all-time high quarterly share of 10.3%. And ARM & HAMMER unit dose consumption grew 31%. In personal care, BATISTE continued to gain share with 33.5% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category, while the category grew 26.7% in the quarter. Now BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 11th consecutive quarter and continues to be the number one dry shampoo in the world. So to conclude, we had a terrific quarter. We have a sustainable evergreen business model, because we have brands consumers' love, our company is a friend of the environment, and that is important both to us and to our consumers, and our people make Church & Dwight just a great place to work. Next up is Rick to give you details on the third quarter and the outlook for Q4 and the full year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.58 per share, compared to an adjusted $0.49 in 2017, up 18.4%. The $0.58 was better than our $0.53 outlook due to a stronger top line and a lower tax rate. Reported revenues were up 7.2%. Organic sales were up 4.7%, exceeding our Q3 outlook of approximately 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our global consumer growth of 5.4%. We're extremely pleased with our results. This is the second consecutive quarter of global consumer product growth in excess of 5%. Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic, organic sales increased by 4.7%. As communicated last earnings call, we expected price mix to be positive in the back half of 2018, which is exactly what happened in Q3 with 2.1% price mix growth largely due to year-over-year couponing declines and lower promotional levels. International organic growth was up 8.3%, driven largely by BATISTE, VITAFUSION and FEMFRESH in the export business. We also had strong growth in Canada and Mexico. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales declined 3.3% due to lower volume as the dairy economy continues to struggle. Turning now to gross margin, our third quarter gross margin was 44.3%, a 100 basis point decrease from a year ago. This includes 160 basis point drag for higher commodities, a 70 basis point drag from higher transportation costs, and a 60 basis point drag from other manufacturing, offset by 100 basis points for our productivity program and 90 basis points of favorable volume and price. Moving now to marketing. Marketing was up $8.6 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was flat at 11.6%, despite recent acquisitions which have a lower spend rate. For SG&A, Q3 SG&A decreased 20 basis points year-over-year. The $7.5 million increase was primarily due to acquisitions, including intangible amortization costs, incentive comp and IT plus R&D investment spending. Net operating profit, the operating margin for the quarter was 19.7%. Other expense all in was $16.9 million (sic) [$19.4 million] (7:49), primarily driven by interest expense and higher debt levels related to acquisition. Next is income tax. Our effective rate for the quarter was 21.9%, compared to 28.7% in 2017, primarily due to tax reform. We now expect the full year rate to be approximately 22%. And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. For the first nine months of 2018, net cash from operating activities was $568 million, an increase of about $145 million from the prior year due to higher cash earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. A bit of housekeeping here, diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were approximately 251 million and that is the expectation for the full year. So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights are 4.7% organic sales growth and adjusted EPS growth of 18.4%. Now, turning to the fourth quarter outlook, we continue to expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.57, a 10% increase over last year's adjusted Q4 EPS or a reported decline of 64% due to 2017 tax law changes. And now turning to the full year, we now expect organic sales to be approximately 4%. We continue to expect reported sales growth to exceed 9%. We continue to expect full year gross margin to be down 120 basis points, in line with previous guidance. And we are tightening our EPS range to $2.27 per share, or adjusted EPS growth of 17%. We're raising our marketing for the full year to be in excess of 11.5%, as we spend back any earnings beat to continue our momentum as we enter 2019. And with that, we'll turn it back over to Matt to discuss pricing before we open it up for questions.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Rick. Yeah. Before we open up the line for Q&A, I am going to cover a couple topics. Few words about pricing and tariffs. So rising commodity and logistics costs have put pressure on our gross margins over the last few months. We've had discussions with our retail partners and made decisions on pricing. In several household categories and geographies we are raising list price in the high single-digit range. And the price increases will start showing up on shelves in Q4. And the pricing covers about a third of our portfolio. Other categories are being planned for early 2019. Too early to talk about those. Naturally if input costs remain high, promotional support in 2019 would be reduced. And that would be consistent with recent trends. And then beyond cost inflation, we are impacted by the tariff war, notably in WATERPIK water flossers. And as a result, we are raising price there as well to protect gross profit dollars in 2019. And with that, I'll turn it over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Congratulations on a great quarter. Matt, can we start on the detail, a little bit more color on the China agreement. How quickly can that ramp for you guys? What does that mean for the growth of the International business. That business has obviously been doing very, very well. What – why should we not think that this would lead to an acceleration above the 6% target at this point?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Kevin, you're like, 6% is not high enough. Huh?
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Yeah.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, look we started making investments almost a year ago in Southeast Asia. You may recall we signed up with DKSH, earlier this year, they're a master distributor. And we've done a lot of training with their people early in this year. And that's starting to pay dividends later in the year in that part of the world. China is more of a long role too. I mean, this company has in the past been a partner with both Cow (12:13) and SC Johnson. And they're going to be our exclusive distributor in Mainland China. But we think it's going to be a slow build. But once again just like DKSH, we think Shanghai Jahwa is going to help make sure we sustain comfortably a 6% growth rate in the future.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, just one more for Rick. Rick, can you talk a little bit, not that I'm not asking you guys to guide on fiscal 2019. But the higher input cost pressure that everyone is dealing with, higher freight costs that everyone is dealing with. Can you talk a little bit about how much visibility you guys have looking out to 2019 at this point in time? Maybe a little bit of color on how much you have hedged at this point. And then maybe even comment a little bit, if we kind of stay where we are at this point in time, what level of pressure should we consider on the company's gross margins, both with respect to commodities, freight, tariffs? So we can kind of ascertain that relative to what might be necessary from a pricing perspective, so that the company may or may not be able to deliver on its longer-term algorithm. Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, Kevin. I would just say that we don't really go into a lot of detail at this point in time on 2019. What I would tell you is you are very familiar with our long-term evergreen model. We aim to have gross margin expansion. We aim to have 3% organic sales growth and around 8% EPS growth. All that is kind of the framework in which we operate under. Yeah, as you know, commodity costs are high. But that is also why companies are leading with pricing decisions and also with lower promotional support. And we're also encouraged as our supply chain continues to build even more incremental productivity programs and progress. So we're not going to go into gross margin expectations now. I'd tell you, just like any year, we do have a big chunk of the portfolio hedged for next year. So we do have good visibility into what we think is going to happen. But we're doing everything we can to make sure we're in a great position for 2019.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and also congrats on a really nice quarter.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thanks, Rupesh.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So on pricing, two questions. So first in the – I guess, the categories that you plan to take pricing in Q4. Are you seeing other players within your categories also taking pricing? And secondly, related to pricing, do you historically see a negative impact on volume when you have the price increases?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, well, first question, one of the obvious ones I'm sure is one of the categories, litter. And yes, it is. We saw earlier in the year that Clorox announced publicly that they were going to raise price. And we also know that Nestle has done the same with Tidy Cat. So that's one that we're following on. As far as how we plan these things, yeah, we're planning that conservatively that there will be some impact on volumes as a result of the price increases. And that's sort of baked into our thinking not only for the fourth quarter, but for next year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And the only thing I would add to that, Rupesh, is these price changes are just hitting retail right in Q4. So it's too early to see or tell you if any private label or other competitors would be following.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then a second question, on the M&A front, there clearly – we're now in a rising rate backdrop. So from a Church & Dwight perspective, do you guys think you're better positioned in this type of environment on the M&A front maybe versus some of the other players out there?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We absolutely do, Rupesh. I think, as you know we're significantly under levered, we're right around 2 times. We have a lot of firepower in the balance sheet. So I think we're in a great spot.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you for squeezing me in. Congratulations on a great quarter.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason, you're the third caller, man. We're not squeezing you in.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I know, I'm sorry. I'm used to being squeezed in. It's just – you're right. It's just a matter of habit. No. Thank you, guys, for slotting me so early. I really appreciate this. This is special.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: That's more like it.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: It's a special day for me. I had a question on M&A, the contribution from WATERPIK. You came in – you were looking for around $10 million of synergies. Where do you stack and rack on that? And you flagged some of the tariff risk going forward. Can you comment on where the profitability of the business is today?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So two things. So yes, you're right, we had signed up for $10 million of synergies. A lot of that was also international growth, incremental international growth. And we're happy to say that we expect all that to come, which is great. And we really integrated the operations, part of the operations, part of the IT piece, and then largely international. So that's where we stand on integration and synergies. Your other question was WATERPIK margin. Yeah, it's right where we said it's been at for the last maybe year, year-and-a-half. It's right at company average, around 45%.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's great. When we flow our best estimate of profitability on that business through, we're kind of landing at a organic profit line, EBIT line for you guys, it's been kind of flattish for the year, maybe down a little bit. Is – A, is that consistent with how you're seeing it? And, B, if so, can you unpack some of the headwinds? How much is commodities? And it's probably the vast majority of it. And how much of it's reinvestment? And as we think forward, clearly pricing has been in the news today. Do you expect that pricing, net of commodities, to be enough of a swing factor going into next year to accelerate the organic EBIT?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, a lot of questions there to unpack. I probably won't go back through our full year gross margin bridge. And early on we said we were getting a little bit of help from acquisitions and divestitures, not necessarily WATERPIK in nature, but some of the smaller bolt-on deals that we had done. I think from an EBIT growth perspective, again we decided to make some choices when we got a great benefit from tax reform. We felt like we were the one company out of many that let most of the tax reform benefit flow through down to EPS. If you look at our peer group, many people ended up spending that or competing it away. We did not, right? We're going to deliver around 17% EPS growth in 2018. So EBIT growth is – for the quarter was actually up as well. But remember, we made some choices to spend back part of that in things that will help us over the next two years, three years, four years, five years. And so we kind of went through that back in February when we gave original outlook, so I wasn't really going to go through that again today.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Very well. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question this morning on your guidance. I'm wondering why you guys expect your Q4 organic sales growth to slow versus Q3 levels. I guess I'm asking this, especially considering the year-over-year comp is pretty similar and the fact that you're stepping up marketing expense in Q4, I guess I would think you'd expect to see some acceleration. So I guess are you guys just being conservative? Or does that have something to do with the pricing actions that you mentioned that you're putting in for the market?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Let me try to take that, it's Rick. From Q3 to Q4 deceleration, so Q3 organic was 4.7%, right. Our implied organic growth is 3%, 3.5% in Q4. When you say the full year is a 4%. So that's a decline of about 130 basis points. And then if WATERPIK is growing around 10%, then that would imply that the base business is decelerating by around 200 basis points, 230 basis points. So that's probably the crux of your question. So around 20 basis points or 30 basis points is because of just, year ago comps, there's a little bit of deceleration, maybe 30 basis points or 40 basis points for SPD, further decelerating because of the dairy economy. But then pretty much the entire piece, around 170 basis points, is because we have lower promotional spending. It's our lowest trade quarter of the year. It's the lowest couponing quarter of the year. And so what we just saw in Q3 with 8 of 11 power brands being down on promotional spending, we just expect that to continue in this environment.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then I had a question on your sell in versus sell-through. We're still seeing a pretty big gap in the Nielsen data, I think it's about a 300 bp difference in your consumers' domestic business. This came up on your Q2 call. And I think that part of the gap was attributed to certainly the strength you're seeing in non-tracked channels and then maybe a little bit from lower couponing. So just wanted to hear from you guys if those are still two of the key drivers of the difference this quarter? And then how should we see this gap going forward? Do you expect it to kind of close in the future?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, no, it's a good question, Bonnie. I think you're right, it's a recurring theme that we talk about every quarter. We were – I think measured channels were around 2%, if you look at Nielsen data. We report 4.7%, so that's 270 basis points. About a third of that is unmeasured channels. So whether it's online growing strongly or Costco or club, those types of unmeasured channels. And then two-thirds of it is coupon reduction and lower promotional spending. So what doesn't show up in Nielsen, as we talk about all the time, is couponing. And so a big chunk. If you go back to laundry even, and we use Nielsen panel data to – as an indication. People can use that as an indication. I think the category for laundry was down 300 basis points in couponing, Church & Dwight was down 1,000 basis points on couponing.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Great quarter, guys.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Steve.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Maybe to follow up on Jason's question or build on that and also your comments in response, Rick. As you said, we started the year, you'd elected to reinvest a sizable portion of the tax reform benefits back in the business. Given the strength this quarter, obviously you're reinvesting further into year-end, which I think makes sense to set yourself up for next year. I guess I'm just trying to parse that a little bit. As we think about all the incremental investments that you've made in totality. Is there a way to frame to what degree they're more kind of one-year discretionary investments, that are likely to or at least could fall away next year? Versus the more structural investments that you mentioned, the ones that may carry a longer term ROI and be with us for the next several years?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I would couch it as most of them are longer term ROI investments, right. Whether it's marketing spending, which is laying the groundwork for not just the next three months, but the next 12 to 24 months in the future, as we build brand equity. Incremental spending for R&D, right? As we lay the groundwork to build a new product portfolio that continues to perform great, like we have in Litter. Laying the groundwork, as an example we added a few heads around our productivity program and how we organize and really get the ideation sessions around that, in order to increase our productivity target long-term. So all these things are building as long-term investments is what I would say.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair. And then I guess just one quick follow-up, it's sort of nitpicky. But the WATERPIK pricing that you mentioned, I just, I don't have any familiarity with elastically in that business. So can you, just based on what you've learned about that business and what you've sort of learned from their past history, as that business has taken pricing to the extent – to the same degree that you're planning to next year, what's been the reaction of the brand in the market.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Steve, it's a good question. We bought the business last August. Not too long after we bought the business, we did some elasticity studies with respect to pricing. And so we don't think there is going to be a significant down tick in volume. And it's a couple of intuitive reasons for that. One is the purchase cycle for water flossers is about kind of every three years. The second thing is that 60% of water flosses are purchased on a doctor's recommendation. And the last thing would be, we're kind of like 98% share of the category, so sort of are the category. So for those reasons, I think there is opportunity to increase price.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Nik.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, Matt. So just two quick questions. One is on just the M&A environment. Obviously you guys have a very good balance sheet with some capacity to do some stuff. So just curious on what you're seeing out there. Looks like at least from the publicly traded companies, valuations are coming down. I'm wondering if that's also happening in the private world as well. So that's the first question. And then the second question is, most companies this quarter have had really good numbers in the U.S. And maybe you can just provide some context around, is this just category growth picking up all of a sudden? Or is the fact that Walmart, which is typically everyone's biggest customer, is having some pretty good same-store sales numbers? Maybe any color around that I think would be really useful. Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Nik, in my remarks, one of the things I said was, in the U.S. our categories are growing, and they have been growing. We have 9 categories out of our 15 that have grown in last four quarters consecutively. So and then if you look at our 15 categories on a weighted average basis, we're over 3%. And last quarter was, I think we said it was 2.7%, the quarter before that was 3% plus as well. So when you look at companies, you have to say, what categories are they in? So we're all not the same. So we happen to have categories that have strength, and we also have strong brands as well. Now your question on M&A would be, obviously we do have a strong balance sheet. But we're very fussy about what we're going to buy. So you need to be number one or two brands, right, they have to have corporate or higher gross margins, got to be able to grow, and they need to be asset light. So it does knock a lot of things out when we start looking at things, but we are always in the hunt.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And just on the...
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And as this...
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, sorry.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I would just add, in terms of your value question, Nik, as interest rates continue to go up, then you're right, valuations tend to come in. I mean, that's overarching what happens over time.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, just back on WATERPIK, just trying to understand. I think you walked a little bit through its impact to organic growth. But is there a thought that – I mean I'm just trying to understand how it's infecting international business? I know it's all kind of classified in consumer domestic. But maybe you can help me understand if that's a driver of the International business? And also from the International, like is there a region – I know you had invested in three different regions over the past few years. If there was one that was kind of exceeding expectations? Or they were all kind of consistent?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Let me take a swing at that, Bill. So we have this 6% algorithm. And when you look at the 8.3% organic growth in the quarter, we're over 6% without WATERPIK. So we're not going to actually call out, well, what – how many basis points. But International is healthy and hitting its algorithm without WATERPIK. But obviously it did become part of our organic in the quarter, so that helped to pop it a bit.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. So it is split for Consumer Domestic and International in terms of the organic...
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. WATERPIK goes...
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: ...into both divisions. I would tell you, just to expand on Matt's comments, it was – it went organic for about a month, maybe a month and a week. And actually I think with or without WATERPIK, the rate for International would've been the same in the quarter.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And I mean just sticking on that theme, I mean was there anything else International? Like is BATISTE continuing to do extremely well in the UK? Or is there any other key driver? Or is it just kind of across the board steady?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, if you think about the International business, some of the businesses that are doing really well are, in export, it would be BATISTE, VITAFUSION and FEMFRESH, which is a feminine hygiene product but not sold in the U.S., but outside the U.S. But we've had strength in the countries as well. So if you want to know, in Mexico, it's pretty much ARM & HAMMER across the board, ARM & HAMMER products, so ARM & HAMMER laundry, ARM & HAMMER dental care, ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico doing extremely well. And Canada, BATISTE and VITAFUSION, similar to export, but also ARM & HAMMER litter. You may remember a few years ago, we took litter up into Canada, and that continues to grow. So we've had strength in the countries as well as strength in export this quarter.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thanks so much.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. I'm not going to ask a WATERPIK question. But wanted to ask you on your consumer products pricing announcements. Wanted to make sure I heard everything correctly. Did you say you're taking 30% – or sorry, high single-digit pricing across 30% of the portfolio. Is that math correct?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, we said – I said a third. But yeah, you're right.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And that's on top of the reduced couponing. So I think that this is – this announcement is incremental to kind of the success we saw in 3Q?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Correct.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then if we kind of like roll that through to think about what that implies for volume, you're still implying that volumes are going to be up slightly for the fourth quarter. Is that the right framework?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. That's correct. We think we're going to have balanced positive volume and positive price mix for Q4.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then the last one would be for the marketing spend. It sounds like you guys feel pretty encouraged and are putting some more back into the business in Q4. What specific brands are you seeing the most responsive to with the ad spend in the marketplace that you felt like taking that up? Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, we have over 80 brands, but we have 11 brands that represent 80% of our revenues and profits. So we'd be ploughing these back into the power brands.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I have two questions around SG&A. First, in terms of the marketing spend increase plans. Are there specific categories where you've decided you want to push the spend? Or is it pretty much across the board, since you have that capability at this point? And then in terms of the SG&A leverage – or the SG&A for Q3, I'm surprised that you didn't get a little bit more leverage off of a pretty strong top-line beat. So I was wondering if you could go into that a little bit? Because your results were pretty impressive. But obviously you didn't see too much leverage on SG&A. Thank you.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So the first question, Matt just answered that from Steve, Olivia. I don't know if you didn't hear it when he was in queue. But really saying that we have 80 brands, but we're going to be spending back the marketing incrementally on the power brands that matter. Your second question on SG&A. We're actually thrilled that we did leverage it, all right? We're down 20 basis points from a leverage perspective. And this whole front part of the year, we haven't been leveraging SG&A, because of all these small deals that have higher SG&A rates. And so just the fact that the WATERPIK amortization kind of rolled, we're comping that now, as an example, in a large way. It just gives us great confidence that our model is intact, once we get through this transition 11, 12 months.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, thanks. And then I'm interested in this China agreement that you referenced earlier in your prepared remarks. I mean what's the plan there? Is it going to be more around personal care brands versus household? And just a little bit more color on that would be great.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Are you talking about the Jahwa partnership? You kind of broke up a little bit.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Yeah.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So we did reference it in our prepared remarks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You mean the categories, are you interested in? Yeah.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Exactly.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So it's – yeah, it's ARM & HAMMER baking soda, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste, BATISTE dry shampoo and feminine hy products would be FEMFRESH. Those will be the four categories.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about China. Because I know I think it was about 1% of International back in 2016. So I was just kind of curious why these are the four categories you chose to go with? I don't really know anything honestly about the baking soda I guess category, or sort of the Chinese view of baking soda as an ingredient. So just anything you could offer on again these four categories and what's already in the market? Because I know it was a little small piece of the business before this announcement? Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So before going forward and picking a partner, we did a lot of homework on what categories would resonate most with the Chinese consumer. And one in particular we thought was very important, it was ARM & HAMMER baking soda. So ARM & HAMMER for our company is $1 billion of our $4 billion dollars in sales. And we've had some success with going internationally with ARM & HAMMER. And we thought that was an important one to set as a foundation for the future in China. And then the other categories we picked like toothpaste, dry shampoo and fem hy, again, because of our market studies, we thought that we had products that would resonate with the Chinese consumer. So that's why we picked those. And our partner is pretty excited about taking those to market for us.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. And I think I could say thanks for squeezing me in by the way. Appreciate that.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Wow, I didn't know you guys were so sensitive to the queue.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: No. Just kidding. It's all good. So first question I guess is on guidance, and if you look at the third quarter you beat your guidance by about a nickel, you're effectively keeping your full year unchanged. And I know you mentioned you're spending a lot of that upside back in marketing. And I'm sure there is probably some conservatism baked into that as well. But beyond those two items, is there something else that sort of changed materially from 3Q to 4Q? Was it really just the higher marketing and conservatism?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Not really. You're right. It's predominantly higher marketing. We might spend a couple million bucks more on R&D again to lay the groundwork for the future but those are – marketing is the bigger one by far.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And, Joe, you know at the end of the second quarter we had a beat as well. And we said we're going to – to the extent that that continues for the year, we're going to spend it back primarily in marketing or any other areas we think can help us long term. And people who have followed us for years know that's consistent with our past practices.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Is retail destocking still an issue at this point? Or is sell in and sell through sort of converging?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, Joe, you can go back and look at the script for the last in perpetuity. We've never called out retailer destocking as an issue. I think it is an issue sometimes in different competitors or different categories, but it just so happens in our categories, we've never really called that out as an issue.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay and just last one, SPD, how big is dairy for that business, given all the acquisitions you've done (38:01)?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: It's kind of round numbers we have, it's a $300 million business. You could see that in the K. And the simple way to think about it is, it's two-thirds, one-third; one-third is bulk sodium bicarbonate, two-thirds is the animal productivity business and that is largely the dairy business. But wouldn't go into too much more detail than that.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's fine. Okay, thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Thank you. So on the organic sales drivers, can you update us on how Trojan performed during the quarter? So historically, you've seen some share losses, but has it stabilized recently? And how are you thinking of the way to reposition the brand to go back to market share gains and potentially grow the category again? And on a separate basis, I was wondering how you did so well in laundry? And you – and Rick commented on couponing being less of an issue. I was wondering how the pie as in total in the U.S. has expanded. So I wonder how, if you can comment on the category from the second quarter to the third quarter, how it expanded. Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. With respect to Trojan and condoms. So the condom category has been under pressure now for many, many quarters. And the reason for that is because a lot of other alternatives that are out there, like Plan B, for example, and the resurgence of IUDs, etc. So we are the category leader. The good news is that in our most recent quarter, we gained share, although consumption is down in the category, our consumption was not as down as much as in the category. And more recently things have been turning more positive for consumption of Trojan condoms. And this is largely due to we have a new Trojan campaign, and we have a new Trojan Man. So I encourage everybody to go out there and look for it. And the new Trojan Man is promoting, it's a big sexy world, so you want to protect yourself with a condom. So the condoms like I said is, there's some secular changes that are going on there with respect to other alternatives. But it is up to us to drive the category. And we think we have a really great campaign right now that's going to help us do that. With respect to laundry, yeah. So the laundry category is less promotional that it was. It's down 130 basis points year over year. As far as in liquid laundry, the liquid laundry category grew 1%, ARM & HAMMER grew 5%. And in unit dose, unit dose category grew 9%, so that sort of reaccelerated. In previous three or four quarters, unit dose only grew – the category only grew 5%. But this quarter up 9%. But we grew at – ARM & HAMMER grew 31%. And ARM & HAMMER now has a 4.4% share in unit dose, so it's up 70 bps. So ARM & HAMMER had a really spectacular quarter. The other two brands, XTRA. We have – in the prior years, XTRA was declining in share. Last quarter it actually held, was up a little bit. And this quarter down 10 basis points. So we think we've stabilized XTRA. OXICLEAN on the other hand, there was a pullback in the quarter for us. And we found that OXICLEAN does well when it's promoted and less well when it's not. So we've kind of been banging around between a 1.1% share when we don't promote, and 1.8% or 1.9% share when we do promote. So all-in, I mean ARM & HAMMER was the star in the quarter. OXICLEAN fell back. And XTRA was – pretty much went sideways.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, that's very help. And, Matt, just to make sure I – it's, all your comments on the percentages, it's all-in dollars, right, I'm assuming? Category growth in dollars.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. That's consumption. Yeah, consumption dollars.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Oh, perfect. All right. Thank you. Appreciate.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. One is you talked about being price sensitive on M&A. But I'm just wondering what the quality of the deals that you are being shown is like compared to history? Are you seeing things that are very interesting, and it's a price issue? Or you're just not seeing anything that interests you?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, look, we would never comment on what we're looking at or what categories. But we have huge discipline with respect to what we'll buy in the company. And as you know, Caroline, we don't – we look at what the fully synergized multiple is when we pay something. So I mean for example, we bought OXICLEAN, we paid 17 times trailing. We bought ORAJEL, we paid 13.5 times trailing EBITDA. But when you look at – so you might say, wow, those are expensive. But when you look at after we've owned them for a year and after we've increased distribution or share or taken out costs, you find that we've paid close to 10 times for these. So I would say there's always something to buy. And so you can only buy what's for sale. But there are plenty of things for sale right now.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And as Matt points out, his comment is really valuation hasn't been the biggest hurdle for us in our past.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And you had a couple of categories where you didn't gain share. And not to take anything away from really spectacular results for the whole year, but what do you think the challenges are in those categories versus others? Is it anything systemic? And was vitamins one of them? If you could just update us on vitamins, because it was an area where there was a lot of private label. How are you doing there?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Even though you got 7 out of 11 brands that grew, it's always what's not going well. So of the four, yeah, vitamins is one of them. But the good news is vitamin continues to grow. So it is a growth area for us. It's just that we're not growing as fast as the category. And there's certainly been – there are a lot of entrants into gummy vitamins, and that's okay. But we're – even though we didn't grow share in – we didn't grow as fast as the category, we are growing. So that's the good news, Caroline, on vitamins.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and morning, everybody. Two unrelated questions. One just back on the specialty business. I think you said at the Investor Day, non-dairy was going to be a little more than 15% of the business. I guess you sort of directionally answered that to Joe's question. I guess the question there is, dairy production certainly seems increasingly competitive. How do you think about where you are in that business at this point? Maybe even relative to where you were 12 months ago or the future competitiveness of it? Or does it need to shift a bit towards other animals, other categories within it?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, we've made three acquisitions over the last three years to get us into other species. And you saw we were down 3% organically this quarter. We would have been way down if we had not gotten into these other species. So that is the good news. As far as the dairy industry goes, the trade war has made things far worse for pricing than we had expected. And so you may know this, is that Mexico is the number one importer of cheese from the U.S. And China is the number one importer of whey protein from the U.S., all from the dairy industry. So that's put a lot of pressure on exports, being – particularly to China. Hasn't hurt as much for Mexico. Now the – those retaliatory tariffs have not come down yet. All that stuff has to be ratified before they're going to come down. So they're still in place. But we do expect dairy prices to recover next year. And it is a cyclical business. So we've seen this movie before. But because we're getting into these other species, we think that over time it's going to flatten out. And we'll have sustainable organic growth of around 5%.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then shifting to WATERPIK, kind of unrelated to some of the other questions. I guess just thinking about it more holistically. So what are you learning so far in selling a product that's a bit different than the other products that you're selling? And can you lever the platform for other similar type non-staple-y products? And then sort of related to that, the innovation you introduced with the whitening tablets, which does seem a bit more staple-y, how has that performed relative to expectations? And kind of what does that mean for the future in terms of what you can do with it?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The opportunity for WATERPIK is both U.S. and international. You may recall when we bought the business that household penetration outside the U.S. was in the mid to low single-digits. And the company had hit upon just a terrific strategy in how to reach hygienists and dentists. And that was by having a large number of hygienists, not employees, but more third parties, calling on hygienists and dentists, promoting the product. So in the U.S. we reach about a quarter of all the dentists in the United States in that manner. And we're replicating that model outside the U.S. right now, both in Europe and in Canada. So early signs are that the model works outside the U.S. as well as it does in the U.S. So I hope that answers your question about how we expect to grow this in the future and where the growth is going to come from. We still think we have plenty of runway in the U.S. as well.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for closing remarks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Well, thank everybody. We'll be announcing our fourth quarter results in early February. As usual, we'll be down at the New York Stock Exchange when we do that. And we'll hope to see you all then.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you on this call that the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filing. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Sir, please go ahead.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a few comments on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is finished I will conclude with some final comments and we'll open up the call for questions. Q2 was an outstanding quarter for our company. Organic sales growth was 4.4%, which exceeded our outlook of 3%, this performance was a clear standout in comparison to our peers. Earnings per share was $0.49 which exceeded our outlook by $0.03. Our reported sales growth was 14.5% which reflects strong organic growth and prior year acquisitions. Sales growth is clearly a powerful earnings lever in an environment with rising input costs. In the U.S. organic sales grew 5% with 6.2% volume growth. Our categories are growing and our market shares are healthy; 11 of our 15 categories grew during the quarter, 9 categories have grown for at least three consecutive quarters. Beyond category growth our share results are solid with 7 out of 11 power brands growing or maintaining share. As we have said in the past, we have low exposure to private label, about 12% share on a weighted average basis. We're having success in the online class of trade. Global consumer online sales continue to grow and we expect it to exceed 6% of sales in 2018. And finally, I'd like to give you perspective on the promotional environment, 8 of our 11 power brands had a lower percentage of products sold on promotion in Q2 compared to Q2 2017, and still we grew. And this is the second quarter that we've seen this and we don't expect that to change in the second half. Our International Consumer business delivered 6.8% organic growth. As you know International has emerged as a growth driver for our company for the past four years. International markets are a bright spot for Church & Dwight, unlike many of our peers, the investments that we have made in new leadership, regional hubs and our brand focus continue to pay off. Our algorithm is 6% annual organic growth for the International business and we expect to meet or beat that number in 2018. Turning to Specialty Products. Q2 was another challenging quarter for us with a 5% decline in organic sales. This reflects lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers, who are being hurt by low milk prices. There is a silver lining though, the acquisitions that we've made over the past couple of years, which got us into the poultry business have reduced our dependence on the dairy economy. So we continue to have confidence in our long-term algorithm of 5% organic sales growth for this business. Now let's go back to the U.S. business for a minute to call out the drivers of our outstanding organic sales growth in the quarter. Our laundry brands reached an all-time high 18.8% share of liquid laundry in the quarter lead by OxiClean. Oxi Liquid Laundry had its highest ever share of 1.9%. ARM & HAMMER unit grew consumption 28%. Consistent with my earlier comment, the amount of detergent sold on promotion in the category was down 500 basis points sequentially from Q1 and down 70 basis points year-over-year. vitafusion vitamins turned in a strong quarter with 6.2% consumption growth on the strength of increased distribution and velocity. Batiste continued to gain share with 36% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category and the category grew 33% in the quarter. Batiste is the number one dry shampoo for the tenth consecutive quarter and continues to be the number one dry shampoo in the world. Toppik and Viviscal turned in a strong quarter with 16% consumption growth. These outstanding hair care brands are growing because they deliver results to consumers with thinning hair. Turning to innovation, innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. We have new products shipping in several categories, all of which have been performing well. In fact sales of our new products are ahead of our 2018 plan. We launched ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL lightweight unscented cat litter with guaranteed seven-day odor control which builds on the success of our CLUMP & SEAL franchise. We expanded our Odor Blasters laundry platform, leveraging technology that helps eliminate tough odors. We introduced new vitafusion and L'il Critters probiotics gummy vitamins which support digestive health. Trojan has launched NIRVANA which is an assortment of sensation condoms in an exclusive package design. Batiste continues to expand distribution with three unique fragrances leveraging our number one share position. And finally Waterpik, Waterpik launched a really cool product this year. It's a water flosser to restore whiteness while flossing. Waterpik has been in the Church & Dwight family for a year now. The business is performing extremely well and we continue to expect high single-digit sales growth in 2018. We are looking at Waterpik as a global opportunity. The power of the combination of Waterpik and Church & Dwight is evident. We are laying the groundwork to sustain a strong growth rate in the future, particularly in international markets where household penetration is much lower than in the U.S. So to conclude, we had a strong second quarter, we had a strong first half. We continue to outperform the market because we have brands consumers love, we have right strategies to grow and our company is a friend of the environment, which is important to us and our consumers, and our people make Church & Dwight a great place to work. Next up is Rick, give you details on the second quarter, and the outlook for Q3 and the full year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning everybody. I will start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49 per share compared to an adjusted $0.41 in 2017, up 19.5%. The $0.49 was better than our $0.46 outlook. The $0.03 beat versus our outlook is made up of $0.03 from a stronger top line, a $0.02 drag on margin due to an oral care withdrawal and then $0.02 from a lower tax rate. Reported revenues were up 14.5% to over $1 billion. Organic sales were up 4.4%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our domestic and international Consumer business. We're extremely pleased with our strong volume growth domestically of 6.2%. And as expected, our negative price mix continues to move in the right direction as I mentioned last quarter. We expect that improvement to continue as we move through the year and for the second half we expect that to be flat to positive. Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic, the organic sales increased by 5%, primarily due to ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, Batiste dry shampoo, Viviscal and Toppik hair care brands, vitafusion and L'il Critters gummy vitamins, and XTRA Laundry Detergent. International organic growth was up 6.8%, driven largely by OxiClean, Batiste, and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent in the export business. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and clumping cat litter, and Batiste in Canada, and OxiClean Ultra Gel and Nair in Mexico. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales declined 5% due to the lower volume offset a bit by pricing. Turning now to gross margin, our second quarter gross margin was 44.3%, a 140 basis point decrease from a year ago. This includes a one-time 70 basis point impact from a voluntary recall and an FDA mandated withdrawal associated with certain oral care products. Other drivers were a 120 basis point drag for higher commodities, a 40 basis point drag from higher transportation costs, partially offset by our productivity program of 80 basis points and acquisitions of 10 basis points. Moving now to marketing. Marketing was up $5.5 million year-over-year. The good news is we didn't cut any marketing, even excluding acquisitions our spending was up slightly. As a percentage of revenue marketing was 13.3%. Compared to Q1 marketing increased 340 basis points. For SG&A, Q2 SG&A increased 110 basis points year-over-year, higher SG&A primarily due to acquisitions, including intangible amortization and higher IT and R&D investment spending. Now to operating profit. The operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%. Other expense all in was $18.4 million primarily driven by incremental interest expense and higher debt levels related to acquisitions. Next is income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 21.7% on an adjusted basis compared to 37.6% in 2017. We now expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%. And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. For the first six months of 2018, net cash from operating activities was $322 million, an increase of $73 million from the prior year due to higher cash earnings and a smaller increase in working capital. Excluding prior year payments totaling $25 million for the UK pension plan settlement, and higher than normal deferred comp payments, cash from ops would have increased $48 million. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights were 4.4% organic sales growth and adjusted EPS growth of 19.5%. Now turning to the third quarter outlook. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.53; a 2% reported increase year-over-year or an 8% increase on an adjusted basis. We expect marketing to be up in Q3 despite the acquisition mix impact I've spoken about. And now turning to the full year, to summarize our thinking, we now expect organic sales to be 3.5%, reported sales growth to exceed 9%, which offsets the headwinds we discussed on gross margin. Full year gross margin will now be 120 basis points down, reflecting the full year impact of the oral care charges as well as higher logistics costs. As a recap, our full year gross margin bridge is made up of a 130 basis points drag due to transportation and commodities, a 25 basis point drag for the oral care issues, a positive 35 basis points of price volume mix driven largely by volume and our full year marketing as a percent of sales will be 11.5%, reflecting the lower spend rates for recent acquisitions. In other words, absent acquisitions our marketing spend rate will be 12%, which again means our marketing dollars are up year-over-year. We are raising our EPS outlook to be $2.26 to $2.28 per share or adjusted EPS growth of 17% to 18% despite the incremental headwinds from margin and currency. This continues to be top tier among the entire industry. And finally turning to cash, we're raising our expectations for cash from ops to $690 million. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Matt for a few more comments on pricing.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, before we open up the line for questions, I just want to take a minute to talk about pricing because I know it's on everybody's minds. So gross margin pressure has been felt across many industries over the past 12 months. We certainly have had our share of commodity and logistic cost increases and we have shared with you our actions to contain those costs, continuous improvement programs, hedging promotional efficiencies, just to name a few. Raising price is the other side of the equation, it's been top of mind this earnings season. So as you know, many CPG companies have already announced their intentions to take pricing to help offset their cost increases. We have reviewed our categories to determine if list price increases are cost justified and would deliver a positive financial result for both our company and for our retailers. And like our competitors, we have determined that in certain categories, pricing actions are necessary to help offset our cost increases. We are in the process of discussing those decisions with our retailers right now. We will not be going into specific details in this call in order to allow time for discussions with our retail partners to take place. But, we will report back with details in early November. We'll now open the line for your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning guys.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Matt, I wanted to start on sort of state of union with the laundry category, your results were great, but specifically around Henkel and the strategy there where it seems like they're really leaning (14:17) and little else where you see (14:19) on some of their other key brands really under quite a bit of pressure and declining year-over-year. And I'm not sure if you (14:26) specifically on sort of a key competitor strategy, but given your price point, you're positioning with ARM & HAMMER in the category. It would seem fair to say that the way their strategy is going really opens up quite a long runway for you to continue to source market share. So if you want to comment on that number one. And then number two, you know as you guys look at the data, is it fair to say that some of the strength in ARM & HAMMER, that you think it's coming from some of those brands that I just mentioned, then I have a follow up.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, well, it's difficult for me to comment on Henkel's strategy, but if you look at where the money is being spent, there's a significant amount of product sold on deal for Persil on the high-end, the same for Tide. So those guys are slugging it out at the high-end of the category and obviously you have to pay for that. So you could say that they're shifting some of the spend from their deep value brands which would be Purex and Sun and shifting it to Persil. I can't comment on whether or not that's going to continue. We have both XTRA and ARM & HAMMER both grew consumption in the second quarter, in fact, all three brands were up. So I would agree with you that ARM & HAMMER has a lot of runway for many years to come, it has been the banner brand for this company, it's a $1 billion brand if you add all the categories. It's the only advertised value brand. So we have so many things going for us that suggest that the train is going to keep on running in the future. And, OxiClean we're encouraged by as well because it has its all-time high share, 1.9, in the quarter. As you know we've been trying to make inroads there into more of the premium end of the category. And XTRA – you remember XTRA last quarter stopped its slide, so it grew consumption last quarter and this quarter. So all three brands are clicking right now. So we feel real good about the laundry category.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: And, Matt, just, we'll stick with that and then I'll pass it on, but a couple of other questions in laundry. How do you feel about pricing – frontline pricing, the category is benefiting from some favorable mix for the reasons we just talked about with Henkel leaning in on Persil. What's your view on pricing? We've obviously had episodic price wars over the years in the category; that doesn't seem to be the case now. If you can just comment on that and maybe the outlook for the balance of the year. And then also early observations on Tide Simply and Proctor's introduction there in unit dose? And then I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well look, when it comes to activity in pricing, it's really a broader issue. So, it all goes back to pressure on gross margins. So, you know, cost increases have been seen for raw impacting inputs pretty broadly and you got a tightening labor market. So wages can also be a contributing factor. So, you got a lot of things going against you and everybody is dealing with this. And productivity gains have been outrun by cost increases and that's why you're seeing people reaching for – for pricing finally. And the commodity pressure has led to two quarters of year-over-year decline in the amount sold on deal. I don't think that's coincidental, that, I think that will likely continue. And I think the need for profits will likely result in greater reluctance to even deal back price increases once people implement them.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And, Kevin, it's Rick. I think one thing that we said last quarter and I want to repeat it again this quarter is our negative price mix trend in the Domestic business, right, in Q1 it was down 170 bps, in Q2 it is down 120 bps. We expect that to be flat to positive in the second half because as some of those promotions don't get repeated, or some of the couponings don't get repeated, not just in laundry but in general, in this environment we expect that to happen.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And back to your question on the launch of Tide Simply unit dosed. So the unit dose category grew 4.3% in the quarter. I think it's the fourth consecutive quarter that unit dose as a category has grown less than 5%. And if the short answer is to how are we doing is, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 28% in the quarter. So I would say that the Simply Tide launch has not slowed down our growth.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you. Good morning.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I had a question on your strong Consumer Domestic organic sales. I guess, I'm wondering why there is such a big disconnect between your very strong results in the quarter and then the weaker Nielsen scanner data. Was the difference mainly driven by non-tracked channels or were there timing impacts from your shipments? And then going forward, how should we think about the contribution from non-tracked business? And then maybe finally, could you characterize the overall health of your inventory levels at retail? Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I'll start with the last one first. It's Rick, Bonnie. But we track shipment to consumption data all the time. We feel like that's very healthy. It's right in line where it should be. So we don't think that's an issue. Your first question is really, help bridge the organic growth for the domestic division of around 5% back to what we would call the Nielsen tracked growth, which is around 2%.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Right.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: So that's about 300 basis points. About 200 basis points is untracked channels whether that's e-commerce, you know e-commerce for us is growing you know 30%, 40%, which is really strong. As Matt said in his prepared remarks that's, for a company, for the consumer business to be in excess of 6% of sales, and then other non-tracked partners as well. And then, so that's around 200 basis points of that 300 basis points gap and another 100 basis points is just lower couponing, right, as we talked about before. We're lapping, for example, we launched a major litter innovation last year for trial, some of the coupon has come down in laundry as well. So the disconnect is really just from a net sales perspective.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then just maybe a quick follow on to that because as I look over the last three quarters, it was more in line. So just thinking through the strength that you're seeing in online, was there a huge step up this quarter for your business? Because you didn't really see that kind of spread in the last few quarters relative to the tracked channel. So just trying to think through how your online business has been performing?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I would just tell you that typically the untrack stuff is just lumpy; online in general is lumpy. So, I think anybody who gives you a forecast on trying to bridge for organic growth to what reported or Nielsen information shows you is just, is asking for trouble. It's just too lumpy to do that accurately. I would tell you there's always going to be a disconnect and in some quarters there's going to be larger than others.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then, just maybe one final question from me on your Q3 EPS growth guidance, it seems a little light versus what you just printed and then what's implied for Q4, you called out stepped up marketing spend. So, I'm curious you know how much is maybe being pulled forward from Q4 and if so, why? And then also, you know, you're expecting commodity and freight headwinds, you know, are you expecting that to moderate by the time we get to Q4? Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, a couple, two good questions. The first one on just the timing. Remember first half of the year, on average, we're about 20% EPS growth. In Q3, we're calling 8% EPS growth. Behind that is we have a step up investment in marketing, we've moved some marketing from Q4 as an example into Q3. So, we're up on a dollar basis about $8 million to $10 million of marketing year-over-year in Q3, which is about another $0.03 and if you just kind of add that back then you're really up around 14% adjusted in the third quarter.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And something else just to keep in mind, we've seen this phenomenon before. Sometimes, we have a front-end loaded year and the way we manage the business is to deliver on the EPS call that we gave in February. So to the extent that we're out running that, we're going to be able to spend it back.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And then in terms of your other question on distribution or commodities, in general, we gave you the full year outlook from gross margin and I did a bridge for you, about 130 basis points year-over-year for the full year. That's pretty consistent in the second half. You know as logistics costs have come through and I think you heard from Kimberly as an example, the pulp prices are up and diesel prices remain high.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, I guess first one maybe just a little more color on Waterpik a year later and just kind of where that growth is coming from? And then, I would assume this is the one business that could be affected by tariffs. So maybe kind of any commentary on what you see on margins, pricing there.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, yes, the business has been, was growing well in 2017 and it's growing high single digits this year. And the formula is that 60% of the purchases are based on a hygienist or a dentist recommendation. And that continues, and one thing we've done is we've expanded the number of hygienists that we have calling on dentists in the United States with great success. That would be one element. The second element is international, this is just a huge opportunity internationally, and we're beginning to establish in a small way the hygienist program in other countries. And that's going to bear fruit for us for years. With respect to the tariff, this is kind of a global comment. It's, the tariff, with respect to China, the current thinking is the exposure's mainly batteries and electronics, but it's not anything that's material right now. The new layers of tariffs could impact a broad range of products, materials, but it's something that we'll just be monitoring closely in the coming months. But so far the stuff that is in place wouldn't have a material effect on us. And just while we're on the topic of tariffs, I know some people have some interest in Canada, and Canada, with Canada's retaliatory tariffs were a larger issue for some of our competitors because it's a very broad list of categories, including things like shaving products, automatic dish washing, products for deodorizing rooms, skin care products. For us, it had a minimal impact essentially on deodorizing products, so like Fridge Fresh would be one that would be caught up on that, it's like a 10% tariff. But really Canadian retaliatory tariffs and Chinese retaliatory tariffs are immaterial right now.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. And then, and just going back to Waterpik real quick.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: You say it's going to, two-thirds of the growth is coming domestic and one-third of that is coming in the international expansion, is that the right way to think about it?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I'd still say that it's more skewed towards the domestic business than international.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then just the other question, back on laundry, I actually was kind of surprised by Oxi's market share and kind of resurgence. Anything more, I mean is that sustainable, is there something that you're replacing? It seemed to be, I wouldn't say left for dead but it had been very quiet on Oxi detergent for quite some time.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, look, Bill, we're still fighting an uphill battle there, because you know we have formidable competitors there in both Tide and Persil. So we're still trying to make sure we have a sustainable beachhead going forward. And it has been, use the word lumpy, it's been a bit of a seesaw. We're up 1.9% one quarter, you're down – your share is 1.5% the next quarter, so we're still trying to break through there and we do that through both coupons, digital coupons, et cetera. So I wouldn't say that we're declaring victory right now.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thanks so much.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. I'm not hearing anybody. Wonder if we lost the connection.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Operator, why don't we go to the next caller?
Operator: Your line is open, sir.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right. Somebody bailed. Go to the next one.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Hey. So, more on pricing if I could. So, I know you said that 8 of 11 categories this quarter showed a lower percentage of products sold on deal versus 2017. And Rick, I think you even called out lower couponing in the quarter which is great. But how do we reconcile that with your overall price mix still being negative in the consumer domestic segment, despite lapping some extremely intense promotions in the year-ago period. That just to me, it doesn't all tie together and it's very surprising. So what's the missing variable? Is it that the breadth of promotion may be down, but the depth is still up or is something else going on that I'm missing?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, no, it's a good question. I think I want you to ask that same question next quarter, Steve. And I think a lot of the heavier promotion that we had was actually in Q3, not as much in Q2. So that's why we're expecting as we go through the second half to have positive price mix and a flat to positive price mix in the second half.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But I mean, okay, your price mix was negative 6% last year, that's pretty intense. You got some big launches, no in Q2?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. No. You're right. We had plus 6% on volume, minus 6% on negative price mix, but it wasn't all promotional spending. That was also, I think I talked about it last year, our household business was growing very fast. Our personal care business was actually in decline, all right. So there are other attributes besides just spending promotional dollars.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I mean, that's fair. But I guess I just want to press a little bit more and just and test it in the context of what we heard from P&G a few days ago. Because on the one hand, and others, but on the one hand, their intention to raise pricing in a couple categories, tissues, diapers, got a lot of attention and I think has prompted a lot of optimism, and I appreciate your optimism with respect to kind of net pricing going forward. But at the same time if I look at what they actually did, they spent a whole lot more than expected in the quarter on couponing and trade investments and essentially signaled that pricing would remain negative for them through the duration of the calendar year. And I just – it doesn't – it just it seems like there is a disconnect between what we're seeing in the quarter and that optimism and I just want to test where your optimism is coming from in that context.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I have one or two comments then maybe Matt has something to add too, but in general we just went through with Kevin Grundy's question about how a lot of the spending in laundry between Tide and Persil has happened in the premium end, right. In general it's encouraging to say sequentially from Q1 to Q2 amount sold on deal's down by almost 500 basis points. So, yeah they might be up, they might be up, but the category was down even sequentially Procter, as an example, was down 770 basis points sequentially, in amount sold on deal from Q1 to Q2. In a world where commodities are rising, labor is rising; I think that promotional spending will come in line.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add to that, Steve, is we've been jumping around here between Kimberly in paper products and back to Tide and detergent. I think, you know, when you are looking at a company, you have to look at what are the categories that we're in; we're in 15 categories. So, on a weighted average basis, our categories have been growing, you know, close to 3% for several quarters now. And, you know, that's what's, makes it so buoyant for us. And you know Rick's right in that, you can look at how, what the laundry war is going on in the premium end, but it's not going on in the value end.
Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. I will look forward to a positive number in Q3. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning and thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thanks, Rupesh.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So, I have two housekeeping, I guess questions, to start. So first, is it possible to get the blended category growth rates in the U.S. and then with your full year guidance for this year, do you at all incorporate any pricing benefits that you expect to take?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: What is the second one?
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: For your guidance this year, your full year guidance. Do you – have you built in any pricing benefits for some of the pricing actions you're hoping to take down the road?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We would make no commentary on pricing just yet, what categories we're, what retailers or what impact it may have.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, more than happy to answer that, Rupesh, next quarter when you ask.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. You had another housekeeping question.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. The blended, yeah I was hoping to get the blending category growth rates in the U.S. if you look at all your categories?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, well, I mentioned earlier that in general that the weighted average rate has been approximately 3% for the last four quarters, specifically it was 2.7% weighted growth in Q2.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, okay. Okay, great. Then in the Specialty Products business, so clearly the dairy side has been challenged lately. So what gives you confidence that you can get back up to that 5% type growth longer term?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, you know it has been a cyclical business historically. We do have some things right now that are exacerbating the situation with what our government is doing. So we have retaliatory tariffs being imposed on being imposed on cheese by Mexico. Mexico is the largest export market for U.S. cheese. So, our retaliatory tariffs by China on whey protein, that's another derivative of dairy industry. And China is the largest export market for U.S. whey protein. So, these duties are slowing the exports of U.S. products and the prices of all dairy products are expected to be soft as a result. We've got storm clouds right now. So, I do think that's going to clear at some point. What gives us confidence long term is the fact that we've now made three acquisitions that have got us into other species, meaning cattle and pork. And we do think that over time that's going to even out. And because those three acquisitions were in prebiotics, probiotics and also food safety, we think there's a lot of runway there and that because we've put those three businesses together and we can now go to food producers and offer control of bacteria both pre-harvest and post-harvest, we think we got a big runway, but we do have to even it out. We've got to get more balance between dairy and the other species in the future, but we're confident we're going to get there, Rupesh.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning. First, just a point of clarification actually on price mix on international, because that moved – that was a pretty big change relative to Q1, the one – the down 1.4% versus a plus 5% in Q1. And the things you cited last quarter don't seem like things that would whip around that much. So, was there any rollback on the pricing in Mexico or a big step change in the mix of products or if you could just give a little bit more color on that dynamic between Q1 and Q2?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Sure. Hi Olivia, it's Rick. In general it was two things. Everything we said last quarter is still true right, going direct to the German subsidy helped in a positive way, price mix for example. But it was overshadowed by a couple things. Now we have heavier trade promotion in the UK and Australia, we have good volume growth there too, but just heavier trade promotion in those two countries and then in Mexico we also have our household business growing very quickly and so that also hurt the mix impact a little bit. And so in general for the balance of the year we expect it to look, actually, a lot like Q2, high volume growth and a little bit of price mix.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks. And then just in terms of the second half organic sales growth obviously it implies, if you're going to get to 3.5% for the year, for growth to decelerate. Obviously, you don't want to get too far ahead of your skis, but what are some of the key factors driving a potential slowdown in second half growth versus first half, because you seem to downplay the benefits from Henkel's challenges, you're obviously feel quite bullish about laundry. Would assume that you expect price mix to improve based on the comments that you cited earlier. So, just trying to understand whether that's just healthy conservatism or something that you see coming down the road?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I think you need to take a step up a little bit, Olivia. It's more, we think we have momentum going into the second half at or exceeding our first half. And the way we look at that is we just look at it on a two year stack basis and really if you remember domestic growth in the first half of the year, last year was really low, the second half it was stronger. So on a stacked basis, the first half the year is 6.2% for example and we expect to exceed that you know 6.3%, 6.4% in the back half of the year. So again it's, just look at it on a two year basis. So it's more of a comp story.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Fair enough. Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Joe.
Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Just want to go back to pricing, not surprisingly, in terms of the pricing that you're contemplating. I know that you know you don't want to get very specific here, but is that mostly U.S. or will that be an international component to it? Given the move in the dollar I would think that that might make that a little more challenging?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, look the – here's what I can say. I mean this is internationally we have raised price already in 2018 in emerging markets; that would be places like Mexico and Brazil as well as our Latin export markets, and that's both for household and for personal care products. So, that's one thing I can tell you that's been in place in 2018. I wouldn't make any comments about 2019 or even second half changes for international. But look, the U.S. is 80% of our business, right. So obviously it's going to be a pretty important lever to affect price increases in the U.S., but no comment on percentages or categories.
Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And in terms of whether you guys are leading or following, I imagine most of these categories will be situations where you're following somebody else or could you be leading in categories like condoms, for example?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, you know what, we're starting to play 20 questions. So, no – good try, Joe. But I think we really don't want to comment any further that. We really want to give ourselves a chance to have our conversations with retailers.
Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And just one last one, this is a little bit easier I think. Are you guys surprise you haven't seen more competition and in more new entrance in the dry shampoo category given how fast it's growing?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, actually there have been you know some new entrants. So for example you know J&J showed up with OGX, right, OGX dry shampoo. And I know in Germany, Nivea has got a dry shampoo that they launched. So, yeah, I mean it's attracting a lot attention. But you know the category grew, in the U.S. grew 33%. Our brand grew 36%, so this is even with new entrants, so...
Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Still taking share despite that obviously.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Right, right, right. So it's a fabulous brand, it's just, it really delivers a great consumer experience and I think that's the reason why we continue to grow.
Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning. We've covered a lot already, but I was curious one point, Rick, you said earlier that the, that online sales were going to be and have been pretty lumpy. And I was just curious why. Like, I can certainly understand untracked channel sales being lumpy whether it's club or whatever else. But I just, I would think online would be sort of steady rate of demand. So if you could just explain a little bit why that would be the case just as for my understanding? Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, so Lauren, this is Matt. You may remember at CAGNY we talked about this at one point where we woke up one Monday morning and none of our litter products were being offered. Amazon decided that they weren't making enough margin on that, so they were gonzo. So the online retailers do control the shelf and they can with a keystroke they could pretty much take you off. We have been making some adjustments in some of our categories as far as what SKUs we offer online. In some cases, we say you know what, we're a little bit too broad and we pare back. So, if we say, let's say we had 40 SKUs in one particular category and we say, now we're going to go down to 10, you could have a loss of online sales for that particular category. And the inverse is true as well. So, it's a shift from the online, from the bricks-and-mortar to online, but it doesn't all, it's a little choppy at times.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Your line is open.
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Good morning. Thanks very much. Question for Matthew, and a question for Rick. Matthew where, obviously with the price and value dynamics, where do you think in terms of household penetration, size of the category, unit dose in laundry peaks and maybe both for yourself and for the category? You referenced the slower growth in unit dose over the past few quarters. Just curious your thoughts on that. And for Rick, what dynamics are allowing for the better cash flow realization particularly seems like better payables performance so far this year? Thanks very much.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'd say this, when unit dose was first launched, I think a lot of people look to Europe and say okay, there's more prevalence of unit dose in Europe and that comes in different forms and if you're including tablets and said well, hey there's one country that 30% of the laundry detergent is a unit dose. The other analogy is, dish washing detergent in the U.S. that's 30 and higher percentage of product is unit dose. So that was sort of the going in expectation, but it has plateaued for the last four quarters. It's in 17% and then went up to 17.4%, 17.6%, maybe it's 17.8% right now. And what we have found over time is that when unit dose was first launched, there was a decline in the liquid laundry detergent category. And the reason for that was because overdosing really stopped with the use of unit dose. But then the growth restarted and liquid laundry has been growing alongside a unit dose for several years now. So, I don't have a crystal ball, but it's not obvious that there's a path to 30%.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And then to follow on your second question, just what's leading to our great cash flow generation. I think even the raise that we just talked about, the incremental $10 million, typically it's half cash earnings and half of that's working capital. Over the long term we've done a phenomenal job on working capital, talked many times about how we've gone from 52 days to in the 20s on our cash conversion cycle. And that has been lead – we're top tier in inventory. We're right in line with everybody else on DSO or receivables. And then, we still have some room to improve on payables and so that does continue. So hopefully that gives you a flavor for it.
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. So my questions are like just two clarifications. First on the pricing as it relates to guidance. Should we assume reducing couponing the third quarter (45:15) and list pricing more into the fourth quarter and also are you expecting to increase prices on the private labels you manufacture as well or this is mostly on the branded products? And second, on the taxes, your new guidance is around 23%, if I understood it correctly from your prepared remarks for the year. So that is to imply because your taxes were so low in the first half of the year, so that is to imply about 24% on the second half. So if that is the case, are you expecting really like this whole pricing situation and lapping a lot of the components you mentioned before and also with increased marketing spending into the third quarter and then that's going to ease off. So your operating results are really going to have to be very strong in the fourth quarter for you to meet the guidance. Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Part one, let me try to take those in order. First of all on pricing, we said we're not going to comment anymore on pricing, so we're not going to comment on private label, on branded, on list price. Come back next quarter and we'll go through any impact that may or may not have on the outlook. You asked about couponing. When I said positive, flat to positive price mix on the organic line for the Consumer Domestic business in the back half, yes it's promotions are lower and couponing is lower year-over-year. That's a fair comment to make. On the tax outlook, yes, it implies a 23% for the year implies a 24% rate in the back half. We had a lower than 24% rate in the front half largely because of option exercises, and that number is volatile and that moves around, and it's difficult to forecast. But in general, we said approximately 23% now for the full year. And then, you did allude as well to marketing shifts, I talked about that in Q3, higher marketing spending Q3, coming out of Q4 operating results are going to be just as solid as they were in the first half, in the second half. So, we – you should see our confidence in our guidance, because we raised our outlook.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason, there's always room for you man.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I appreciate that. Congratulations on the great volume this quarter. It was impressive. I wanted to come back. I have two questions, one on price and one on gross margin. Imagine that, another price question. But I wanted to come back and just re-ask Steve Powers' question, because I thought it was a good one. You're lapping some promotions. You've got 100 basis point benefit from couponing in price this quarter. Personal Care is now mixing higher 8 of 11 brands, power brands promos down. Why is price negative? I still don't understand that.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we have incremental trade spending in a couple of our categories, right. We have – that's probably in essence the easiest way to say it. That's why price mix is still negative in the Consumer business. It's a competitive environment. Although, it is getting better, I think people forget context sometimes. Back in Q3 of 2017, also goes back to your question, Q2 of 2017, price mix was minus 630 bps; in Q3, it was minus 490 bps; in Q4, it's down to 130 bps; and in Q1, we're down 170 bps; in Q2, we're down 120 bps. And so, the curve is coming down in the right direction. We're seeing the macro stuff support that and that's why we have confidence in the back half to continue to improve.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Very good. I appreciate that. And then, quickly on gross margins. I guess there are a few moving pieces, I could throw a few questions at you, but I'm going to try to stay focused on one. Commodities and freight, you're calling for a 130 basis point headwind for the full year, I think it was 100 basis point last quarter, you were 85% hedged, suggesting you're seeing movement on that 15%, is that right? And given the hedge position and I know if you go through you 10-Q, you've got a lot of commodity derivatives that historically you haven't really had. Should we be – should we be concerned that as your hedges sort of roll off you've got another step higher of inflationary pressure as we roll into next year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, good question, both of them were good questions. On the first one, I would tell you, let me try to simplify it; our outlook was 80 basis points of decline in margin. We've moved to 120 basis point decline in margin for the year, that's two pieces, 25 basis points was really because of the oral care withdrawal and then about 15 basis points is logistics. And logistics, just to give you a sense of what that really is, now we're – we saw some more inflation on inbound freight as an example that gets rolled through on material pricing. And we also are seeing, you know that we have shipments that go from the U.S. to Canada, there is a higher spot pricing because truckers don't want to come down from Canada into the U.S. in a more regulatory environment with all the new labor laws and whatnot for truckers. So there's a little more spot pricing there than we expected, nothing that material. So in general commodities are still and distribution is about 130 basis points year-over-year drag. I guess that's the big picture. Your second question Jason, can you remind me with that was?
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: 85% hedged as of last quarter, lots of derivative contracts in the 10-Q that we haven't seen in the past, what's the risk of you sort of these rolling off into a higher cost environment into next year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Really, the biggest hedges we have out there are really for and you'll see this in the 10-Q are for surfactants or ethylene for HTPE for resin and for diesel, and net-net as they're close to washing. I mean it's nice to have certainty and now we're 88% hedged and we're already hedging 2019 in some cases in order to again have predictable movements on our cost structure. But in general, I'd say those net differences aren't that material.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Helpful. I appreciate it, I'll pass it on.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Jason.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to go back to Olivia's question, just as a clarification first. So I still don't necessarily understand the back half commentary, especially as you have Waterpik hitting the organic base, so that would suggest if you sort of backed that away, that the two-year gets somewhat worse. So I guess are you being conservative or are there things that you're baking in there from a geopolitical standpoint that you're expecting potentially to worsen, maybe just a little bit of color in that context? And then just secondly, separately, the growth in the untracked channels online specifically. How should we think about the opportunity or white space to put more product into those channels going forward, meaning sustainability of that relative to not the overall category growth, but just incremental in terms of putting more product there on the virtual shelve. And then just what about the broad level of support or spending for brands in that channel versus track channels, meaning is it lower, is that rate increasing sort of normalizing versus traditional brick-and-mortar? Any sort of help there will be useful.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, I'll take a swing at the online class of trade and then Rick will comment on your second half sales question. So, the online class of trade sales grew 40% in the quarter year-over-year. So, that would include both our direct-to-consumer business as well as anything we sell in the online class of trade. Now, all of that as you know is not incremental. So, you essentially have consumers moving from one class of trade off from bricks-and-mortar to the online class of trade. You had a question about the cost associated with that and it is more costly to serve the online class of trade, because you do have to create web pages, you have to maintain them to your; so the maintenance part of it is expensive. It can be less expensive for digital marketing, because I'm sure you've heard that over the past couple of years that the number of impression is less expensive online than actually going through television for example. So, it's a bit of mix there. We had 1% of our sales were online in 2015, it was 5%, 2017. We expect to easily exceed 6% this year. So, it is going to continue to grow. The gross margins right now are somewhat comparable between the online class of trade and bricks-and-motors, so it's not really hurting us from a profitability standpoint on the gross profit line. But it is more expensive to serve that class of trade from an SG&A standpoint. I hope that helps you.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And then in terms of the second half dynamic you're asking about and Olivia did as well. Again, on a stacked basis, we have a strong first half and we have even higher second half. And yes, Waterpik is a tailwind, but let's drill into the volume for a second. First half, volume domestically on average was around 3.5%. And last year, volume on average was 5.5%. And so, we've told you a couple of times that we don't need to spend as much on coupon as an example in the back half of the year because we do have all these tailwinds that we've talked about. So, in general, we think the momentum was very strong and we feel good about it. Is that it?
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right. That concludes the call today. We'll be talking to you again in November after the end of the third quarter. Thanks for joining us today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filing. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to provide some color on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO, and when Rick's finished, we'll open up the call for questions. So Q1 was an outstanding quarter for our company and there is lots of good news. Our reported growth was 14.7%, which reflects the Waterpik acquisition and strong organic growth. Organic sales growth of 3.8% exceeded our outlook of approximately 2% and we also exceeded our EPS outlook. In the U.S., organic sales grew 3.6% with 5.3% volume growth. I'll take a few minutes on the environment. It's instructive to take a moment to look at our playing field and see just how good the results are in Q1, despite what you're hearing about the environment. Of the 14 primary categories in which we compete, 10 of the 14 grew consumption year-over-year. More than half of those categories grew at 3% or better. We have low exposure to private label relative to our peers, which contributes to our success. And with respect to the pricing environment, 8 of our 11 power brands had flat or lower percentage of products sold on promotion in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017, and still we grew. Most important, 10 of our 11 power brands grew or maintained share in the quarter; 8 of the 11 grew share, so we are winning in the marketplace. This signals the relevance and long-term health of our brands, which is grounded in innovation, and gives us confidence in our long-term algorithm to grow our U.S. business by 2% annually; and, we expect to exceed that goal this year. Now, let's take a look at a few categories. In liquid detergent, which accounts for almost three-quarters of the category, ARM & HAMMER liquid share hit a 12.2% share, our second highest quarterly share ever; Q1 is the 33rd consecutive quarter or more, and that'll be eight years of continued share growth. Turning to cat litter, the clumping cat litter category grew 3% in Q1. ARM & HAMMER litter grew faster than the category and, consequently, grew share. In VMS, consumption was up for both vitafusion and L'il Critters. Two key drivers were our new ad campaign, which drove online sales up significantly, and of course, the flu season, which drove sales of vitafusion Power C and L'IL CRITTERS Immune C. Dry shampoo consumption grew 32% in Q1 and dry shampoo is now a $170 million category in the U.S. Our BATISTE brand grew consumption 50% and now commands a 33% share of that category. We have launched new variants to continue to broaden our line, and BATISTE continues to be the number one dry shampoo in the world. Our International Consumer business delivered 6.8% organic growth. International has emerged as a growth driver for our company over the past four years. The investments that we made in new leadership, regional hubs and our brand focus have been paying off. International markets are a positive for Church & Dwight, unlike many of our peers. Our algorithm is 6% annual organic growth for the International business and we expect to meet or beat that number in 2018. And by the way, our global consumer online sales continues to grow and is now in excess of 5% of sales. Turning to Specialty Products, Q1 was a challenging quarter for us. Our animal productivity business saw a decline in demand due to low milk prices and higher feed costs. There is a silver lining, though. The acquisitions that we've made over the past couple of years, which got us into the poultry business, have reduced our dependence on the dairy economy. If you went back a couple years when we saw a similar decline in milk prices, sales declined approximately 5%. This quarter, the business declined less than 1%. So we continue to have confidence in our 5% long term growth algorithm for this business and we believe our diversification moves are working. Turning to innovation, innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. We have new products shipping in several categories. We launched ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL LIGHTWEIGHT UNSCENTED cat litter with guaranteed seven-day odor control, which builds on the success of our CLUMP & SEAL franchise. We expanded our Odor Blasters laundry platform, leveraging technology that helps eliminate tough odors. We introduced new vitafusion and L'IL CRITTERS Probiotics gummy vitamins, which support digestive health. Waterpik launched a really cool product, a water flosser to restore whiteness while flossing with the new infuser technology. TROJAN has launched NIRVANA, which is an assortment of sensation condoms in an exclusive package design. And finally, BATISTE continues to expand distribution with three unique fragrances, leveraging its 2017 growth and our number one U.S. share position. Now finally, Waterpik. Waterpik joined the Church & Dwight family last August. At the time, we had expectations that the business would grow faster than our evergreen target of 3%. The business is performing extremely well and we now expect high single digit sales growth in 2018. Last year, we found that the business is responsive to advertising and we expect to continue to invest. Previously, it was largely an unadvertised business. The power of the combination of the Waterpik and Church & Dwight teams is evident. We look at Waterpik as a global opportunity. We are laying the groundwork to sustain this strong growth rate in the future, particularly in the international markets where household penetration is much lower than the U.S. So just to wrap it up, we're off to a great start this year. We continue to outperform the market because we have brands consumers love, we have the right strategies to grow and our people make Church & Dwight a great place to work. Next up is Rick to give you details of our first quarter results, and the outlook for Q2 and the full year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I will start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.63 per share compared to $0.52 in 2017, up 24%. The $0.63 was better than our $0.61 outlook, largely due to our stronger than anticipated top line. Reported revenues were up 14.7% to $1 billion. Organic sales were up 3.8%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2%. The organic sales beat was driven by our Domestic and International Consumer business. We are extremely pleased with our strong volume growth domestically of 5.3% and, as expected, our negative price mix continues to move in the right direction. And, we expect that improvement to continue as we move through the year. Now, let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic business's organic sales increased by 3.6%, primarily due to ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, OxiClean stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, and vitafusion L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins. International organic growth was up 6.8%, driven largely by OxiClean and the export business, Sterimar, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OxiClean in Mexico, and Femfresh and BATISTE in Australia. For Specialty Products division, organic sales declined less than 1% due to lower volume. The U.S. dairy industry demand is significantly reduced due to low milk prices, as Matt mentioned, but our recent acquisitions continue to reduce volatility. For the full year, we now expect this business to be flat. Turning, now, to gross margin, our adjusted first quarter gross margin was 44.9%, an 80-basis point decrease from a year ago. The Q1 decrease was primarily driven from higher commodities. Now, for the full year, gross margin is expected to be down 80 basis points, and, it's really three primary drivers: incremental commodity headwinds are worth around 40 basis points; incremental transportation costs of around 10 basis points; and, negative brand mix as our household business continues to grow faster than our PC business. The good news is that we are now 85% hedged, so there is not a lot of volatility remaining. Moving, now, to marketing, marketing as a percent of revenue was 9.9%, which was down 40 basis points year-over-year. If we exclude our recent acquisitions, marketing was actually up 20 basis points to 10.5%. For SG&A, Q1 SG&A increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding acquisition amortization, SG&A as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat at 12.8%. And to operating profit, the adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.9%. Other expense was $19.6 million, which was a $13.7 million change year-over-year, largely due to $21.7 million of interest expense due to our higher debt levels. Next is income tax. Our effective rate for the quarter was 21.4% on an adjusted basis compared to 30.9% in 2017. We expect the full year rate to be between 24% and 25%. And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. We generated $155 million of net cash for the quarter, $24 million increase from the same quarter a year ago, largely due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital. So in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 3.8% organic, which translated into our reported EPS growth of 24%. Turning to the second quarter outlook, we expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.46, a 59% reported increase year-over-year or 12% increase on an adjusted basis. One note on SG&A for Q2, it's going to be a bit higher as we have our acquisition impact, like you saw in Q1, but also investment spending kicking in, Germany and International head count, plus incremental R&D spending. And now, turning to full year, to summarize our thinking, we now expect organic sales to exceed 3% and reported growth of approximately 9%, which offsets the headwinds we discussed on gross margin. Our full year marketing as a percent of sales slows down a little bit for the company due to improved Waterpik top line performance and our small SPD acquisitions, both of which have low or no marketing associated with them. We continue to expect EPS to be $2.24 to $2.28 per share, or adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 18%, which is top tier among the entire industry. And finally, turning to cash, we expect Cash from Ops to exceed $680 million. And with that, we'll turn it back over to you guys, so Matt and I can answer any questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. So you talked about your expectations for unfavorable product mix and pricing continuing to improve from here. I'm just curious what is driving that, if you could provide a little more color there?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Erica. It's Rick. I would tell you, for context, if you think back, in 2017 we had some big negative price mix in our Domestic business. Remember, for the full year we were down 320 basis points. In Q4, we were down 130 basis points, and now in Q1 we were down 170 basis points; so, mitigated from 2017. We're always going to have some negative price mix. I think over the last five years, we've averaged around a 120-basis point drag. That's just the nature of our business. But the good news is, as some of the trade optimization, some of the couponing is reduced over the year, that's really what's driving improvement in negative price mix. We also have – our personal care business this year is doing a little bit better than year ago.
Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. And then, just staying along the lines of pricing, are there any signs out there yet of others attempting to take price and are you expecting pricing to be a bigger contributor later in the year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, this is Matt. As everybody knows, commodities and transportation costs are rising. That's tempering the appetite to compete on price. Of course, to take price, typically you need a strong position in a category and a cost story to the retailer. So an example would be condoms, where we have a 70% share and latex costs would be important to that category. As Rick said, we think that price mix is going to improve from here out, from Q2, Q3 and Q4, for two reasons. One, is the trade optimization plans and we have less couponing planned for the year. But as you've heard us say more recently at CAGNY and at the Stock Exchange, pricing is difficult to take in this environment. But to the extent that we would be taking price, we wouldn't be telegraphing that on a call.
Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I'll hand it over to someone else.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey, Matt, just a quick follow-up there on the pricing discussion. So Clorox sounded pretty good, better than most, I think, this earnings season so far with respect to the ability to take pricing. So understanding this is – you guys lead in baking soda and contraceptives, but in – the cat litter business is a big business for you guys, obviously, and they talked about taking pricing there. Is it fair to assume then, I guess, that you guys will follow if they take pricing, number one? Number two, is there any benefit from that in the guidance, just so we're clear?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. This is probably why the general counsel always sits with us when we're on these earnings calls, holding up a big sign saying, no. So Kevin, the reality is, yeah, we're aware of what Clorox said with respect to the litter category. So that, obviously, is just a data point that we would have with respect to what actions we would take, but we wouldn't comment right now what we plan to do or not do. And there's lots of ways to get price. As I mentioned, there's trade optimization. There's also less couponing. There's also pack sizes and how much product you put in the pack. So there's lots of ways to do that without messing with the list pricing, but we wouldn't go any further on that question with respect to the litter category.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And I would just also add to that, right, we had minus 1.7% drag from price mix, but we had strong volume growth, right, in excess of 5%. So that equation works pretty well.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Matt, just to stick with the pricing piece, is it your sense the tenor of these conversations now that retailers are starting to let up because the narrative that's out there is pricing is constrained, and the model is broken for staples companies? Is your sense now that that's misplaced, maybe the market's run too far to one side of the boat and that pricing will be available where you're leading and with innovation?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I would say that, if you talk to our sales guys, they'll say it's no easier to take price now than it has been in the past. You have to be able to take it selectively, so to the extent that you have a really good cost story. But I wouldn't say right now that the dam has broke and now the retailers are open arms with respect to price increases.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And the other good news there is when we do launch new products, they're typically accretive, right. Our SLIDE product for litter is an example of just great innovation and it's accretive to margin. So that's the other end of the spectrum.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. If I could just slip in one more, just on the Waterpik business, which seems like it's on fire, high-single digit growth, and that's all presumably domestic at this point without you guys really leaning in on the international expansion piece. So a couple questions there, Matt. How sustainable is the high-single digit growth domestically? And then, number two, what's sort of the timeline to extend the business, potentially, internationally as well, because it seems like that could be a real contributor to growth looking out to 2019 as this moves into organic? And I can pass it on after that. Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Actually, international business is rocking, Kevin. So we got after that immediately in the second half of 2017. So that's one of the reasons for the high-single digits growth rate. So – and as far as do we think it's sustainable? I mean, we think it's sustainable at least through 2019. We wouldn't want to go much further out than that.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And just to add to that, by August 1, international Waterpik and consumer – and Church & Dwight will be fully integrated.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, Kevin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, thank you. Good morning.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I had a question on your organic sales growth. You guys took up your guidance for FY 2018 just slightly, but your Q1 sales came in quite a bit better than you expected. So could you give us a sense as to how much of your improved full year outlook reflects some of the strength in Q1 and whether this means you're likely to see moderating growth, particularly in the back half of the year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, Bonnie, that's a fair question. It's Rick. We did exceed our expectations in Q1. I'd say, on average the – in Q1 we were 3.8% organic and we said 3% in Q2, so on average it's about 3.5%. And so, that would imply that it's slightly lower than 3% in the second half. But if you look at it on a stacked basis, on a two-year basis, we're around 6% – solid 6% or so as you go through each of the quarters. So I think part of it is just a comp story, but we think the core business is doing great throughout the year.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That helps. And then, a second question on freight costs, not surprised that they were a headwind for you guys this quarter, but given the magnitude of increase in freight and what we've seen across the sector, could you guys give us a sense as to some of the levers maybe you can potentially pull to reduce any freight costs you might have in the near term, and then even more significantly, over the long term?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, Bonnie, it's Rick, again. I would say, in general, transportation, and you know this very well, across the industry has been a big headwind. For us, it hasn't been as big of a headwind. I think we do have some things to our advantage, like we do have dedicated carriers for a large bulk of our network. We do have multiple sites that produce and ship products, like as an example, laundry detergent's made in three places throughout the country, right, and that helps. We do have some customers that do pick up. So by and large, we have great partners as well. We had some of our key partners in this month and we always try to find a way for us to invest correctly so it's optimized, and our productivity program even goes all the way through our transportation network.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And Bonnie I would add to that, you may remember us talking about this, that we got out ahead of this...
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: ... in the second half of 2017 with our partners and, consequently, we probably don't buy as much on the spot market as some of our peers because of the great partners that we have.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just...
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. I just wanted to touch base on your comment of like – I think it was eight out of 11 categories had lower promos this quarter versus a year ago, and just trying to understand, is that a trend? Is that more reflective of last year? Was it hyper promotional, especially in detergent? Is that a way we look at it as a way to kind of affect price increase by having lower trade promotions for the rest of the year? Just trying to understand that. And also, I assume that had some benefit to gross margin. Is that sustainable in terms of keeping gross margin from falling too far?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, Bill, if you think about those 14 categories, 9 of them are personal care and personal care is not as heavily promoted as household. So if you thought about where is the – if you – so what are the three that are not lower year-over-year? Laundry would be one of them. So the laundry category, it was – grew by 0.6% in the quarter. We had a great quarter – ARM & HAMMER grew 9% consumption. And the good news is XTRA was – grew with the category and had flat share. So the category – that one was way more promotional year-over-year. So sold on deal in laundry was up 400 basis points. And that was largely driven by Tide and Persil, and they were both up well over 400 basis points sold on deal. We, on the other hand, were up 200 basis points. So – and we were essentially on the sidelines in comparison to those guys. But back to the original comment, because we're in personal care and it's less promoted, it's really the household side of the house that you have to watch more carefully.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. So it's not something as we look for the remainder of the year that should be fairly stable? I mean, you don't expect promotion levels to be – tick back up?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, we think it's going to be fairly stable, Bill. In the example of Q1, the promotional category that was up slightly was laundry and that was already accounted for in our Q1 gross margin and our outlook, but we think, overall, it's a great trend. Most of the businesses in which we compete are not as promotional and we think that's really true for the company from a portfolio perspective versus our peers.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And that's why Rick was saying the average price mix for the last five years is 1.2%. So yeah, and that's generally driven by the household side of the business.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And then, switching to International, how does that play out this year, which you'd kind of talked about at the Analyst Day was a lot of initiatives, a lot of things that were kicking in, a lot of new product launches? So it would seem that it could accelerate from here. I understand 6.8% is still a great growth number, but is that the fair way to look at it? There is still more to come?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: So Bill, you're not disappointed with 6.8%, are you?
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I didn't say that. I just said it's a nice number.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, look, we got a 6% algorithm and we just think it's sustainable. Think of all the things we've done. We've expanded by establishing an office in Panama and Singapore. That's certainly benefiting our export business. We opened a new subsidiary in Germany, which is – we hadn't been there previously. And now, we just got way more focus, got great people in there and we think we're going to hit 6% or better for the year.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just want to talk a little more about international, again. First is just price mix was really strong in the quarter, so any color you could add there, if it's geographic mix, pricing. What was sort of driving that? And then, also, I think, if I recall correctly, Mexico is a good-sized business for you and we've heard kind of mixed reports from other companies about sort of the Mexican consumer resilience in a slower economy. So anything you could offer to some of the Mexico portion of that business would be great?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'll start with Mexico. So Mexico has been just a fabulous business for us for the last few years and they've been growing double-digit. And I think that's as a result of a lot of the focus that we have down there. And we have both household products and personal care products and I think it's a question of execution, Lauren, for us in Mexico. And so, we have – again, expect double-digit growth for Mexico this year. So it's been a great story for us.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And as for the positive price mix for International business, you're right, it is a little bit outsized. There's three things. One is Mexico had some good price increases that are flowing through. Number two is that the PC brand mix is also very strong for that business. And then, number three, as we go direct to Germany and take the distributor margin, in effect, that's a good guy from a price mix perspective.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So we can look at price mix being a pretty healthy contributor to that business for the balance of the year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, just final thing is I wanted to confirm that tax rate for the full year guidance is unchanged?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Correct, 24% to 25%.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So I just want to follow up on Lauren's question and ask it maybe a different way, sort of glass half empty. If you look at International, that's always been volume driven. This quarter was sort of price mix driven with a bit of a slowdown in volumes. Was that because of the price increases in Mexico, at least in part?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think price – I don't want to repeat what Rick said, but yeah, that was definitely an element in the first quarter.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. But going forward, I mean, how do you see the composition of that growth? Is it still going to be more volume driven?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Over the long-term, of course. Just like our core consumer business, it's largely volume driven. I think this year there is a piece of it, because when we go direct, we take out the distributor margin, like I mentioned. And International business does – is able to take price globally pretty well, too. But in general, it's volume driven business with a little bit of price.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, just on gross margin, Rick, I just want to clarify something you said earlier. You said transportation and commodities were an additional 50 basis points, right, because I think in February you told us that that would be a headwind of 50 basis points to 70 basis points?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, that's right. I think there is a – yes, it's an incremental hit. So now, today, I would say the full year drag from commodities is around 80 basis points. The drag from distribution is around 20 basis point, so 100 basis points all in from those two things.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And one of the planned offsets was the mix between personal care and household, and it sounds like that's not happening, at least the way you guys expect. So I'm curious, what was going on there?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think it's more net good news than anything. Our personal care business, this is the second quarter in a row that we have growth. So that's a great thing organically; it's kind of turned around from 2017. It's just our household business is growing even faster than we expected. And so, that's part of the reason we raised the reported outlook and the organic outlook.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, Matt, Rick. Good morning. So I'd like to, please, zoom in in the laundry business. So I appreciate the comments before. But as we saw in the tracked channels, it seems like there's – you picked up share from a competitor, who had some supply chain transitions during the quarter, and – at least, if we look in the Wall Street version of Nielsen. So we see them gaining share, but you said flat. So part of the question is, is it true that you gained share in the tracked channels, but not broadly? So, does that imply that the top two competitors are gaining share online? So – and then, how are you thinking about the competitive environment in laundry? And you said – I mean, just trying to mosaic what you said in terms of the fact that you had some pick-up in items sold on promo during the quarter. So how are you seeing and how is your embedding – are you embedding on the guidance in terms of the competitive environment, and specifically now? Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I just want to be clear that we had a smoking quarter in laundry; smoking. I mean, the category grew 60 bps and ARM & HAMMER laundry grew 8.9%. OxiClean liquid laundry detergent consumption grew 30%, and Xtra, for the first time, held share in quite a while. So all three brands showed up in Q1. So – no, we had a fabulous quarter from a share perspective and we didn't spend to get it, unlike our competitors. Like I said before, the sold on deal was far more promotional this year than last year first quarter, up 400 basis points, and that's all Henkel and P&G. So, we were...
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, so – sorry to interrupt. I was just trying to clarify because I thought you said something about shares were flat. So I was actually surprised because we saw shares going up. So you're saying shares were broadly up, right, for the laundry...
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: For Church & Dwight?
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah. That's right in the Nielsen's, yeah.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: That's what we're quoting.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then – and so, you expect that to continue or are you thinking, obviously, Henkel had some issues with logistics, and then that also could have been a tailwind for you? Is that something that you think is consistent or you're seeing them, again, trying to defend, because I'm sure they will try to defend the share that they lost?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, I think one thing to keep in mind is this is the 33rd consecutive quarter in a row that we've grown share in ARM & HAMMER. And we think we've stabilized Xtra, and OxiClean has been growing. So I like our chances going forward. This isn't just an anomaly in Q1. We've been growing ARM & HAMMER quarterly for eight years.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's fair. Thank you so much, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Steve.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Steve.
Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. So, just to go back to the Waterpik growth, because it was a standout. The high-single digit growth that you're expecting – I just want to frame that in the context that the timeline for consumers to replenish on that product is longer than in most of your portfolio. So can you just share any data around whether you're seeing those early wins converting into sustainable consumer retention or whether there is any risk that, initially, your distribution wins and trial might fall off over time? Just how you're thinking about that?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: What we see, frankly, is that gum health is starting to matter to consumers. So – and you are correct in that it's a longer purchase cycle, but we bought Waterpik because they had good growth for each of the last three years. So, you have repeat purchases and you have households that have one, two, three or four Waterpiks – flossers. So, you are correct in that it's a long purchase cycle, but the company has been enjoying the interest in gum health. So if you look at toothpaste, for example, you saw that GSK launched parodontax. And then, there's been one or two other entrants into toothpaste that are directed towards gum health. So it would seem that in oral care that gum health, where once upon a time I think people might have frowned upon whether or not using flossers was beneficial, I think that's changing. The Waterpik business has done a fabulous job in reaching the dental community through a hygienist program and we expect to replicate that internationally. And, early days, we think that international is going to be a goldmine for us in that business.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And I think, just to say one other thing, Steve, is to be able to call the full year up high single digits in late April, early May just shows you the confidence we have in that business.
Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, for sure. No, thank you. Matt, were you foreshadowing a new gum health ARM & HAMMER toothpaste launch?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, I was not. I was not telegraphing that, Steve, but it's a wonderful idea.
Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, I know it's a reasonable distance in the future, but we saw Lou Tursi's intention – his announcement to retire early next year. So can you just talk us through the plans and processes that you're going through for succession, because obviously, he's been a pretty integral part of the Church & Dwight story. So just love your thoughts there. Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. So yeah, Lou's going to be leaving us at the end of the year. Huge shoes to fill. The process is that we'll do an external search. Lou is on the interview team. So the next leader will have his full endorsement or Lou will be continuing to work in 2019 and 2020. And so, we'll plan on hiring that person pretty early, so that we'll have plenty of overlap this year.
Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Maybe we can get Lou back at the Stock Exchange next year for a proper sendoff. Thanks a lot.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Great idea.
Operator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you. My question is around pricing. Obviously, I understand you don't want to preview any pricing plans, particularly if you're potentially in active discussions with retailers right now. But conceptually, if commodities and transportation costs are going up and you feel – sounds like you feel really good about your shares and competitors are pricing, why would you choose not to follow?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We never said that, Olivia.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh, I know. I know. I'm just trying to understand.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Again, we don't really like to get into the pricing telegraph discussions. I think in general, the comments from me on the call were, over time with higher commodity costs, higher transportation costs, if we would lead in certain categories, we would follow in others. There's more than one way to take a price increase besides list price increases. We talked about trade optimization, couponing, pack sizes, all that other stuff. So that's the extent on which we're going to make any comments on pricing.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks. And then, your organic sales growth, obviously better than many in CPG, so I'd love to get your perspective from you on the U.S. retail environment and the state of the consumer. I mean, obviously, you probably got a little bit of help from Henkel's challenges this quarter, but are you seeing incremental shelf space, new distribution, better online pick-up? Just what are the key drivers of the growth?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, we would say that the consumer is strong. In the economy, I think one of the things you always have to keep an eye on is gas prices. It's clear that the tax reform has put more money in the pockets of consumers. So we would say that the consumer is strong. So it's a good environment right now. As far as, are there going to be winners and losers out there? Absolutely. But we – the way we look at it is we have 11 brands that consumers love. We support them. We're improving our ability to target and connect with consumers and our online sales continues to grow. So we're well positioned to be a winner.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Hi. This is David Mandel in for John. Thank you for taking my questions. I would like to start off by just asking about Henkel's 2016 expansion into the laundry category. At the time, it seemed to be a game changer and it really hasn't been. And I think that's proven out to be – is it better data that you guys have? Are you guys targeting or is it something else? Why are you guys performing so well?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I think the short answer is that ARM & HAMMER is the strongest brand in value laundry detergent.
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Well, that's easy enough.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: And if I had to ask, would you be able to dimensionalize how much higher gross margins are in pods versus liquid, say within a brand family like OxiClean?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. We don't – we just don't go into the level of detail, David.
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Okay. And finally, hopefully, I can go two for three, instead of one for three. If – could you speak to the – to what's going on in the channels that are better for you than the channels that are worse for you in terms of drug and grocery shift to mass? Is that still a headwind? Is that still a risk?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: So phrase that again. The shift to...?
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: The shift out of drug and the shift out of grocery into mass. I believe in the 10-K that's called out as a risk in terms of net sales.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, it's been a trend for quite some time. I think the bigger trend these days is really the online shift. But I think we're well positioned in both classes of trade.
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: So, you're not seeing anything pick up. It's pretty much status quo?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The way to think about is we have to go where the consumer is, right.
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Right.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: So you're right, over time you have shifts from one class of trade to another. Some would say that the dollar class of trade has been strengthening over time and continues to strengthen. That may be just a reflection of the consumer's interest in value and value brands. But I would say we look at that in totality and we want to win in every one of our classes of trade.
David Mandel - Consumer Edge Research LLC: That's great. Thank you so much for the color and I'll pass it along.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning guys.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just had a question on the vitamin business. You've owned Avid for about five years now, and I think at the time you acquired it it was around a $250 million business with $70 million, $75 million of EBITDA. Can you talk about the kind of growth you've experienced, has it kind of met your expectations, and as you look forward, the opportunities from here that you see to grow the business, whether it's predominantly in the adult segment, children's segment, a combination of both? And I'll throw a third one in there. I think at the time you talked about the gummy biz was potentially a mechanism for delivering other kind of benefits, medications, other wellness benefits. Is that still something that you think you can do over time in that business? Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. You're right. So the business, when we bought it, was approximately that size. It did grow rapidly, initially, at first. Certainly, the first year that we owned it attracted a lot more entrants into the category, so our growth rate slowed. And you may recall, a couple of years ago we had difficulty in bringing the new plant online, so we went sideways in growth for at least a year. But we think we've got that turned around right now. So we had some growth last year for the first quarter; vitafusion, the adult gummy, grew over 6% consumption, L'IL CRITTERS grew 2% consumption. So that bodes well for us. Our focus is on adult. That's the big market. We think that the kids gummy vitamins is somewhat saturated, but the big opportunity is in adult. And with respect to medications, you're right. The thinking is, is there a way to take active RX products and put them in gummy form? The difficulty is in masking the taste of the active, so that you still have a great taste in gummy. So that is not something that we've been able to solve to-date, but that would certainly be something that, if we could sort it out, would be another avenue of growth for us.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for any further remarks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, guys. We'll let you go. We had a fabulous quarter. If there are no further questions, I want to thank you all for tuning in today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, everybody. It is game time. And I want to thank everybody for coming today. Have lots of familiar faces in the crowd. We had a terrific fourth quarter and concluded another solid year at Church & Dwight. And our call for next year is 16% to 18% EPS growth. This is tops among CPG and it reflects the efforts of our employees as well as the team that's here today, we're going to have the whole management team up here at the end of the show. There have been mixed results of late in CPG, as you all know. And before we get into the formal program, I'd like to spend a few minutes recapping why we are a standout among CPG. So, we have a portfolio of brands that consumers love, and we have employees who are committed to making those brands successful. We have an evergreen model, which leads to consistency and a financially literate company. We are lean, we like to keep it simple, and this enables two things, it's speed and our ability to adapt the change. I'm sure many of you heard us say in the past that we think change is our friend. And if you look at our portfolio, you get a little more granular. You'll see that we have a lower exposure to private label than most of the CPG companies. And we also have a lower exposure to promotional categories. And finally, we make really good choices when it comes to acquisitions, and that results in us riding waves. And those waves include dry shampoo for example, gummy vitamins, hair thinning, gum health and you'll hear a little bit more today about alternatives to antibiotics. And these are the reasons why we expect to continue as a standout in CPG. And if you were investing in the consumer space, there's no better place to invest than Church & Dwight. So, now I want to get into the formal part of the program. First is the Safe Harbor Act or Statement, I encourage everybody to read it. There is the agenda. So, I've a one page short story. I'm going to run through who we are, state of the business, and what innovation we have coming in 2018. Then we have three members at the management team come up, talk about our digital capabilities, our continuing great story in International, and also, educational part of the program today is our animal productivity story, which is a fabulous story. And then we'd come back up, talk about how we run the company, and Rick's going to wrap it up with the financials. Okay, short story. So, I hit a few of these upfront, solid year. We have a lot of confidence in 2018 and beyond. Terrific results, all three segments are healthy. And you see on the far right side, we're going to cover those three points later on today. All right. Who we are? So, we are a company with 11 power brands. Those 11 power brands drive 80% of our revenues and profits. All of our efforts are concentrated around those brands. And we have a balanced portfolio between household and personal care brands and we have a thriving specialty products business. We also have a nice balance between premium and value products 60%-40%. And now, we're a small company, so we operate in the land of the giants, but that helps us. We are a very nimble organization. So, the three things that enables us to do. We make quick decisions and not a lot of bureaucracy in our company, easy communication, and our ability to adapt. And we have a long history of growth through acquisitions. You can see $1.5 billion in 2004, $4 billion we will cross in 2018, and 10 of those 11 brands that I talked about, they were all acquired since the year 2000. So, we are regarded as an acquisition platform. So, we're a company that can buy a brand, help that brand to grow, bring some ideas and some operational efficiencies to the business, and we have a terrific track record with acquiring businesses, large and small. And we have access to capital, so we continue to do that. And we're very fussy about what we buy. So, this criteria, many of you, and particularly our long-term holders know this very well; so we buy number one or number two brands, high-growth, high-margin, they need to be asset-light. If you go all the way over to the right, this is the way you can ride a wave. You got to make sure you have a sustainable competitive advantage from the business that you're buying. And in 2017, we bought our 11th power brand, Waterpik. So, number one power flosser and number one shower-head replacement. So, if there's one thing to remember, we're a company with 11 power brands today, we're looking for 20 tomorrow. So now, state of the business, which is terrific. So, you all saw this in the release this morning, Q4 up 3.4% organically, double-digit EPS growth, and a great quarter for cash. All three businesses are healthy, that's Domestic, International and Specialty Products, all growing. And here is our report card. So we're pretty transparent about how we're doing with shares, show this to you every year. Seven out of our 11 power brands grew share in 2017, so terrific result. And if you look at measured channels and non-measured channels, look at category growth, so the Nielsen, the measured channels, we would say account for 1.7% of our all-in category growth. But because non-measured channels are growing double-digit, that adds another point to what we would say is our all-in category growth. So, we would say the categories that we're in on a weighted average basis are growing. And that's a nice tailwind for us. I mentioned earlier that we have low exposure to private label. You can see five out of our 14 categories have private label exposure, but generally they're very stable, not growing. Now, innovation, always a good story for us. So, SLIDE was a fabulous new product launch for us in 2017. So, we're going to build on that in 2018. Also in 2018, for Clump & Seal lightweight, we're coming out with an unscented variant, this unscented is growing. In detergent, Odor is the new stain. So, we're taking our Odor Blasters concept and we're moving it across all of our variants in fabric care. Next up is gummy probiotics. You know us as a gummy vitamin company, we're moving into gummy probiotics in 2018. First Response pregnancy kits, so if you're a hopeful positive, you're going to check once, you're going to double check, you're going to triple check. So, this product is doing extremely well, we just launched it. And Batiste is a juggernaut for the company, continues to grow. Not only has our share grown, but the category has been a rocket ship for several years now. And why? Because, 80% of women do not wash their hair every day. Waterpik's got a couple of new products coming out. This is a really good one, convenience of whitening while flossing. And then if you have a dog, you know what's like to wrestle a dog in a tub. So, we have a Waterpik Pet Wand Pro. I encourage everybody to get this if you have an animal, because it makes shampooing your pets a lot easier. All right now, I'm going to bring up Britta, Britta Bomhard has been with our company for 4.5 years. She ran our European business for 2.5 years. In January of 2016, she came over and became our Chief Marketing Officer. So, she's going to have some fun with you now, and update you on our digital capabilities.
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Happy Monday, everyone and particularly Eagles' fans. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about the digital capabilities we're building. And I thought I'd start by grounding ourselves. So, first of all, in 2015, 1% of our sales was online. In 2016, we doubled that to 2%. And as you can see, in 2017, we really accelerated and now 5% of Church & Dwight sales are online, which from all the information I have, puts us in the top scale of our peer group. So, you might wonder what have we done, how did we get there? So, how did we accelerate? First is, we are and invest where the consumer is. Secondly, we have a growing expertise in digital attribution models. And thirdly, we are developing our DTC skills. I'm going to take you through each of these topics one by one so you understand more what we're working on. So, first of all, how long do you think U.S. consumers spend online? Five and a half hours. So, a lot of you might think that's not me. But, if you total up your phone usage, your computer usage, watching Netflix or being on the game console, that makes five and a half hours on average every day. So, what's important for us? We have to be where the consumer is. And what do the consumers do when they're online? So, first of all, they want to be entertained. Secondly, they're looking for products, they're searching for product information, and then they shop. So, what we've done very deliberately is resource allocation. So, now more than 35% of our advertising spend is digital. We make sure that every single one of our products has a great review and we're aiming, and the majority already has a 4.5 or above rating. And we've spend a lot of effort to bring more than 1,000 product pages to life, so that when consumers are online, they get great information about our products. So, we are number one, for example, on Amazon, for baking soda, Trojan, First Response, Batiste. That shouldn't be surprising, because we're number one for those products also in bricks and mortar. But we're actually also number one on cat litter, which is much better than our bricks and mortar performance. And then we have brands where actually the consumer online matches so well with our target group and where we work hand in hand and partner. We've great campaigns like the New Year, New Me campaign and we get extraordinary results. So, in Vitafusion, our market share in the gummy category is more than 50% in Amazon; sets us apart from all our competitors. So, online presents a great opportunity for us. 24/7 the consumer can get our products. And let me illustrate that with a little example. If you have a health and hygiene problem, you probably don't want to be seen going into store and some hygiene products are not readily available, not all retailers have it, whereas if you go online, that category is fully there. So, great opportunity for us to get full distribution on all our products. Secondly, we learn a lot about the consumer in their online journey. You get great consumer insights, and also with that insights, you can develop better targeting, better messaging, and with that, better results. Why should you believe me? We're actually at the point where we do predictive modeling, that's the lovely black box, and we've seen in the first couple of brands that we get sales improvement of up 12% versus last year. So, I'm sure you would love to know what's in our black box; obviously, I can't tell you. But I will take you through the part that's visible. So, coming back to the Super Bowl and our competitors, and you might have seen ads about clean clothes or about one type of stain, which was I think avocado. Let me talk you through how we as the leader in stain management are actually targeting. Stains are much more complicated than you think. So, now during Super Bowl time, you might have pizza stains, so you might have wet stains or whatever was on your Super Bowl menu. But when it comes to maybe March, April, better weather, you're going to actually have grass stains or dirt stains. During the course of the year, different stains become more prevalent, and then actually there are different type of person. So, some people here in that room know how annoying these makeup stains are and some people in this room don't care about makeup stains at all. And if you've been a new parent you know that for once spinach stains and carrot stains start to dominate your life, things you've never dealt with before. So, stains vary by the season, by the type of person you are and by your life stage. So, let me see what I can show you on one stain, what we do with that, which hopefully applies to lots of people here, red wine – and it went dark, sorry. So, we have with Dear OxiClean, a great campaign which can target every single type of stain and because the product has such a great performance, consumers actually write to us and share their successes and we turn that around into campaigns for our consumers. So, let's have one of our campaigns. [Video Presentation] (00:13:38-00:14:31). So, you're seeing a real consumer story, we've shared back. We equally have most people who discovered that OxiClean is fantastically cleaning your boat or baseball stains and so on, so on. And in the digital world, you can even do hyper-targeting. So, we are able to target people who used to buy bleach and no longer buying bleach because they're dissatisfied; so, lapsed bleach users. And here I have another campaign for you. So, this is actually digital online, and as you know, lots of people watch it while they're supposed to be working. So, this is silence, so your boss doesn't discover that you're online instead of working on that presentation. So, another great example of how we really target the pain points of consumers, and what has that produced? It has produced two great results for us. First of all, the category which has been down in the past is back to growth. So, stain fighting for long time now is invigorating and growing again. And secondly, we now have over 50% market share in that category, which is our all-time high. So, Dear OxiClean, thank you. Now that I've talked a little bit about this, I wanted to move on to the next topic which was our direct-to-consumer. Direct-to-consumer is a marketeer's dream, because what I just talked about and we have the acquisition of Toppik and Viviscal, which helped us build that capability. Why is it marketeer's dream? Because here there is no broken link in the data. So, if you sell in bricks-and-mortar or even to Amazon, you cannot follow one person from start to finish, whereas in direct-to-consumer you can. That means we're not only able to see which campaign got how many people to buy, but we can also see how often did they repurchase and how many years did they keep repurchasing. And that gives you such a wealth of data, it's just so exciting. We can try campaign A versus campaign B. We can actually try medium A versus medium B, and we can see all the way what it does to lifetime value of a consumer. So, lot of fun, great stuff, great learnings. And then, we have also I think learned a lot about digital advertising and how it works. As I said earlier, it's all about entertainment. And one of the things in part was all about features and benefits. So that's no longer the case. So, we are now much more about emotion and humor, and I know I probably have found a great targeting category for all of you, because you all every day think about bathroom cleaning. I know you can't wait to learn features and benefits. So let's see our latest campaign for Kaboom. [Video Presentation] (17:32-18:43) So, if you want to have an oddly satisfying moments, there are Kaboom cans on your tables, we can fight over them. So, I can only say we think the future is bright for Church & Dwight in online; we are number one on online market shares. We're getting a growing expertise in attribution modeling. We are having great and growing DTC skills and I think we're becoming more skilled in connecting to consumers. And with all of that, we're having a lot of fun. So, I think we are only at the beginning of a great journey of using digital to its fullest. And with that, I would like to introduce Steve Cugine, who is our Head of International. He is actually the composer of our international strategy, the conduct of a fantastic international team, and I'm sure his presentation will be music to your ears. Steve?
Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Britta, thank you very much. So, I'm excited to be here today to share the international story. I am very excited about the Eagles winning. It's been a long, long time, and so two things to celebrate today. But I wanted to first ground us in where our subsidiaries are located outside of the United States. So we have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada and Mexico, Brazil, the UK, France, Australia, and effective January 1 of this year, Germany, capitalizing on our strong growth in that country. The international business has been a historic grower for the company, very consistent, performing at the high-end of our Evergreen range. But in 2013, Adrian Huns, the former President of the division, was retiring. And I had a passionate belief that the international business represented a growth engine for the company that was yet untapped, and the management team also felt the same way. So they asked me to come in and develop a new strategic plan for the international business. We began to implement that new strategic plan in 2014. Q1 of 2014, we had 0% organic growth. By Q4 of 2014, we hit 7.4% and frankly never looked back. What I'd like to do is now establish a new Evergreen target for the international at 6%. And we're confident that we're going to be able to deliver that organic growth moving into the future, and I'll tell you why. But first let me unpack the box of our international strategy a bit for you today. First, we differentiated developed markets versus emerging markets. We said that these markets are unique, the consumers in those markets need certain brands that are highly differentiated, and our go-to-market strategies are much different. So, we identified and focused on these six brands across North America, Europe and Asia. So, differentiated strategy based on markets, focusing on a select few brands that will get our attention and disproportionate investment. We did the same thing in emerging markets, to really capitalize on the expanding middle class in China and Southeast Asia, South America, Middle East and Africa. And you will see a slightly different set, smaller set for these markets. But we've seen the success of this strategy in that, our markets where we have subsidiaries, we've seen increased growth across our subsidiary markets and certainly exploding growth in our export markets. This pie chart frames the difference between our subsidiary markets and our export markets. Our subsidiary markets represent 74% of our total and export represents 26%. Export has been growing double digits in the past and will continue to grow double digits in the future. This is also a key part of our strategic plan shift that we implemented, export used to be incorporated in – as part of the subsidiaries. We separated this out to find it as a strategic business unit for the international business, and we run it as a separate business. So combined, we found that with that focus and these new strategies, our subsidiary markets improve their growth rates and we're able to really capitalize on a very fast growing business called export markets. And we wanted to invest behind this growth. So in 2016, we created sales and marketing headquarters in Panama, Singapore, and the UK designed to support our distributor partners in region. I want to shift a little bit to the Asia-Pacific region. We have experienced very significant growth, so our Asia-Pac business grew 30% last year. And so we're excited about this growth and we by focusing more time and attention to this market, we expect it to deliver continued strong growth into the future. As we all know, this market is exploding. The middle class consumers are growing quite dramatically and that will continue. So we want to position ourselves for success in this market. So, I talked about adding regional sales and marketing headquarters in many parts of the world, but Singapore is one we established in 2016. We've been increasing head count and investment in our Singapore office and in this region. As I mentioned, this region is growing 30% or has grown 30% in the past year. In the announcement, we also talked about our new relationship with the DKSH, which is a leader, one of the leading distributors in the Southeast Asia region and Hong Kong. And we just completed training 200 of their sales reps. So we are investing this year 2018 behind increased distribution and additional marketing, so we expect very significant growth from these emerging markets. But you can't talk about Asia Pacific without talking about China. We have a relatively small business today in China. That business doubled last year off a small base and we're really evaluating our strategic plan to really capitalize on this for the future. But, I would say, maybe the biggest news today for International and Church & Dwight is, we believe that we really have achieved critical mass. In 2017, we finished the year with over $600 million in sales and we have – we believe between our subsidiary markets and our export markets a real global platform. And so, we're going to leverage this global platform to drive growth of our acquired businesses. These four businesses will all see very significant growth in 2018 and we believe beyond. Let me give you an example. So, Waterpik, when we acquired this business had three people in Canada, but we have 100. They had seven people in Europe and we have 280. So, we have scale that we can really bring to these businesses, and we're excited about growing them dramatically. So, I believe the international business is well-positioned for 6% growth moving into the future. Why, we have brands that have significant runway. For example, our ARM & HAMMER brand is our largest brand in the portfolio, and it continues to deliver strong organic growth, and we believe that is well-positioned in emerging markets to continue to grow. Exports, as I mentioned has been growing double digits, and we expect that to continue. We're investing significantly in Southeast Asia and China ,and that will be a growth engine for us moving forward. Our acquired brands, all represent significant opportunity for growth. Last, but not least, we have some members of our international team present today, and so I'm proud to say that we've built a cadre of very strong leaders and managers that really understand their markets and are driving growth whether they'd be in our subsidiary markets or anywhere where we export our wonderful products. So, I am very confident in our ability to deliver 6% or more per year moving forward. Well, I'd like to introduce Scott Druker. Scott is 9 years with Church & Dwight, and he is the architect of our animal nutrition business. So with that Scott, welcome.
Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: So, when you present, you're supposed to know what your audience knows, so by show of hands, how many people know what the animal productivity business is about? Hey, more than I would have thought. So, if I accomplish nothing else, at least this video I'm about to show you, should give you a good concept of what our business is about. So, with that, if we would kick the video in. [Video Presentation] (28:50-30:19) So by confession, I am not a farm kid. I was born and raised – well, born in Princeton, raised in Philadelphia. So, I stand here today. I'm very proud Eagles fan. Hopefully, I won't get emotional over that. But in addition to that actually what I am is the guy that has the best job at Church & Dwight, all arguments aside. I get to come to work every day and lead an awesome team of people that are really passionate and dedicated to help and provide safe affordable food to the world. It's a team of trained salespeople, most of which are an animal science degrees. We lead a team of vets, microbiologists, immunologists. So, it's a really just awesome, awesome group of people that are very dedicated to what they do. So before I get into the details of the business, I thought I'd share with you three key trends that are really going on in the marketplace that are creating opportunities for our business. The first is literally the amount of resources we as a species are consuming. We are consuming our resources on this planet one-and-a-half times faster than we're replacing them. Our current population today is roughly 7.5 billion, projections have grown to close to 10 billion by 2050. So, we have some really significant challenges and opportunities when it comes to feeding a world population. So, improving productivity is a key, and you can think of a certain ways we can deal with these challenges. One, we could control population and fortunately Church & Dwight has some products that can help on that end. We could change what we eat. You've probably seen in some popular press, some more promotion of the benefits of eating insects. I'm all for choice. I like my protein really from the traditional animals, but hey, go for it. But the real opportunity and this is the one where our business is, is really about leveraging technology to help drive productivity gains. So, just to give you an example, I'm going to just walk you through an opportunity in the dairy market, but this story could be told whether it's swine, chicken, aquaculture. In order to feed 10 billion people consuming – in the future, consuming the same amount of dairy products that we do today, we would need to add 66 million new cows worldwide to produce enough dairy products. If we can just get the current population of dairy cows to produce a half a glass of more milk a day, we don't need to add those 66 million dairy cows around the world. So, what does that mean to us? That means, we would be able to save the equivalent of 6,000 Empire State Buildings worth of food that's fed the cows each and every year. It would save the amount of land that needs to be used for farming to raise feed for animals, that's the size of Alaska, every single year. And we would save the amount of water each year that could supply Germany, France and Great Britain. Productivity matters, and it can really, really help improve the lives of people around the world. But it's not just about resources that's really driving and creating opportunities for our business, it's really consumer trends that's probably having the greatest short-term impact on our business. We in this room and particularly the younger generation that's coming up has made it very loud and clear to retailers, they want their food product to be free of antibiotics, added hormones, any chemicals. And the retailers have responded. I'm sure you all have seen in the news, virtually every significant restaurant chain or supermarket chain come forward with a long-term sustainability plan and a commitment to get antibiotics out of the food. Now, of course, that puts a lot of pressures on farmers today, who have to look at alternate ways of raising livestock. So, it's challenge to find technologies that are going to enable them still to grow healthy productive animals when some of these tools are being taken away from them. So, what we've been as a business as the video show, we got into this business in the early 1970s, and it was anchored around feeding baking soda to dairy cows. And we really put the science behind the benefit of feeding baking soda. And for those that may wondering, it's basically Alka-Seltzer for dairy cows that helps as they eat more and become more productive, they need baking soda to help. And that's really where we anchored our business. And then really over the decades, we really led and pioneered new innovations in feeding, mainly in dairy. We offer a product, Omega 3, Omega 6 fatty acids to help with reproduction in animals. In the early 1980s, we introduced MEGALAC, which just celebrated its 30-year anniversary, and it's still the number one bypass fat fed to cows, and the fat is fed to help them – give energy to produce more milk. So, you could see we really, over the years, built a lot of natural solutions, fats, natural amino acids, baking soda, all anchored around that ARM & HAMMER brand that we go to market as. Then, in 2015, we had an opportunity to add prebiotics to our portfolio through the acquisition of VI-COR. It's really exciting. These products, A-MAX and CELMANAX, are yeast-based products or cell wall based products, and they're really targeted to help improve gut health in animals, to help improve health, welfare and productivity in animals. And then, most recently, in May of last year, we acquired Agro BioSciences, which is a really exciting business, brings probiotics into our portfolio of all-natural solutions to help livestock producers grow their animals. So, I'll talk a little bit about that Agro business, because it's a really exciting business about us and really is a unique approach that we have to going about a business. So, your typical probiotic company, whether they're selling to humans or animals, has a strain or two that they've done some testing to show its benefits of killing bad bugs or helping good bugs grow, and they go to market with those one or two strains. What we do in our business that makes us unique is we have the ability to develop a customized or bespoken – heard that one, right, bespoke, bespoke product, just learned that word last week, which is embarrassing, since I like doing crossword puzzles. But we have the ability to come in with a customized solution. So, here's where I'd give you an example. I want you to think CSI meets agriculture. So, think if you're a poultry operation and you have challenges. We have the ability to go in, sample the feed that the chickens eat, the litter that they're raised in, actually swab the chicken itself and get a full picture of the microbial diversity that's present, the good bugs, the bad bugs that are present. We're then able to screen through our thousands and thousands of proprietary probiotic strains to find the right mixture for that operation to kill the bad bugs and help the good bugs grow. And this really now is a tool that a lot of the livestock producers, whether in dairy, aquaculture, swine, poultry, are looking for since these are really the alternatives to helping improving the animal's health as the antibiotics are being removed. So, it really ties us all together with some really natural solutions that help drive productivity gains. So, the couple of recent acquisitions certainly brought new products into our portfolio. But one of the things that it really helped us do is become a more balanced business. If you look prior to 2015, we generated less than 1% of our revenue outside of non-dairy. We finished 2017 with more than 10% of our sales from non-dairy, and our outlook for 2018 is to continue that growth trend and see more than 15% of our sales coming from non-dairy. The diversification isn't just across species, however. Like we've heard on the Consumer side, we've had an opportunity to grow internationally. 95% of the world population eats food outside the U.S., and we have been woefully under-represented there historically. But we've changed that over the past few years. In 2015, less than 5% of our sales were outside the U.S. and Canada. In 2017, it was greater than 10%, and our outlook for 2018 is continue growth there greater than 15%. And as Steve pointed out, we're very confident for our outlook of continuing at 5% organic growth within our business as we look at 2018. One of the key reasons, our brand is really trusted in the marketplace. It's trusted obviously for just the recognition on the Consumer side, but we're recognized as a science leader in our industry. Probably the most important thing that gives us a lot of optimism and excitement is our product portfolio, as Matt alluded to, about riding a wave. We are riding a wave. We have the right product portfolio to capture a lot of the opportunities there with our natural solutions, whether they're the probiotics or the yeast-based products, to meet the needs of consumers. Clearly, our new products as well as some of our traditional portfolio has opportunities across species, and as I showed earlier, we started that and we're going to continue that pace getting into global markets and global species. And that actually wraps it up as well. On the International side, we sell product now in over 70-plus countries. We have an excellent team of people internationally to help drive sales for our business. So, the future is very bright and we're very excited. So, hopefully, I accomplished one thing and you know a little bit more about our business today. So, with that, Rick, I believe – oh, Matt, you're up. I probably should have known that.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right. Okay. That was Animal Productivity 101 for everybody today. It felt like the Discovery Channel a little bit. All right, I'm going to spend a few minutes on how we run the company, before we get Rick up here and talk about the financials. So, just a few words. So, we have four operating principles. One is we have number one brands and we've leveraged those brands. Those are the 11 power brands that are 80% of our revenues and profits. Number two, we're an asset-light company. We're very focused on the relationship of cash earnings to our tangible assets. Third thing is people. We have fabulous people in our company. You've seen some of them present here today. We have a lot of passion for the company, for the brands, and you can't manufacture that, you can only feel it. So, if you take those three things, leverage brands, assets and people, you get good results. But then, on top of that, the company has a competency to target and acquire businesses. We've been doing it since 2001. We're 16 years in. We know how to do it. And that's why we say, if we have 11 brands today, it's going to be 20 tomorrow. It's just a matter of time. And we focus on gross margin. This is a big part of anybody's financial model. Four ways to get it. First is your continuous improvement program, which is we call Good to Great. The second thing is supply chain optimization. Occasionally, we expand a plan to invest in new capital equipment. Third thing is new products. You want to launch new products that have a higher gross margin than the product that it's replacing. And finally, acquisitions. Virtually every business we buy, we find ways to improve them and expand their gross margins. Our compensation structure is very simple. So, there's four things, net revenue, gross margin, EPS and cash flow. It's been like this for quite a while. It's 25% each. Everybody understands it and we keep it simple. And we also have an all employee bonus, and 25% of that is tied to gross margin. So, when you have a simple incentive compensation plan, it does promote financial literacy. People in our company know what cash flow is, they know what gross margin is, and it helps get it. All right. Now, I'm going to bring Rick up here to wrap it up, and then after that, we'll have some Q&A.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to go through the outlook, talk about 2017 and how we finished that with a lot of momentum, and then we'll spend a couple of seconds – or minutes on the Evergreen Model as well. So, just as a backdrop, right, the Evergreen Model, 3% organic net sales growth. We've been doing that for quite a while, and that's kind of the bedrock of the model. Gross margin, typically 25 basis points of expansion, and Matt just walked you through some of those details. Marketing, in terms of percentage is flat, but in dollars is up typically year-over-year, and Britta walked you through how we're better targeting consumers in the digital space. SG&A, we leverage as the top line grows, and we get about 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, which leads to 8% EPS growth before those acquisitions. We talked about this within the last year a couple of times. You heard it again today. When we're talking about 3% organic sales growth, we're saying 2% for the Domestic business, 6% for International and 5% for SPD. And of course, if any one of those over-deliver, that falls to the bottom line. Okay. Q4 2017, you've read it in the press release this morning. We had a great finish to the year. Organic sales growth was almost 3.5%. Our outlook was 2.5%. So, just far and away, just great broad-based strength from across all of our brands. One to note is our personal care growth was up 4% organically, right, so just a lot of momentum there. Reported growth was 15% versus our outlook at 12%. About 1% came from organic, 1% came from the Waterpik acquisition, and then 1% came from currency and some of the other smaller acquisitions. Consumer organic was up 3.2%, and gross margin, in a world of higher commodity costs, we were up 50 basis points for the quarter. Operating margin was up 90 basis points and EPS was up 18% to $0.52. So, as you can see through the bar chart, Q4, we exited with a lot of momentum. That's kind of the theme. 3.4% was the high watermark for the year. If you look at it from any angle on a two-year stacked basis, again, Q4 was a really strong quarter, 6.7% for the Consumer – Global Consumer business. Turning to the full-year really quick, 2017 organic sales growth was 2.7%, almost 3%. Gross margin was up 10 basis points. Marketing was down slightly at 12%, which is a key number for us. SG&A was up largely because of some of these acquisition costs, right. We have non-cash amortization. We bought – some of these acquisitions have higher SG&A rates. We have some transition costs. So, SG&A is up slightly. So, that leaves the operating margin being down slightly. EPS is up 10% to $1.94. And then, a hallmark of this company is cash flow and cash flow generation, so $637 million or 123% free cash flow conversion. So, the theme there is just a lot of momentum, and so not only did personal care grow, but a couple of quarters ago – and we talked about this last quarter on the call, the promotional environment, right. In Q2, price/mix was negative 600 basis points for us in the Domestic business. It was minus 490 basis points in Q3. It was minus 100 basis points in Q4. So, that environment is improving as well in those key categories. Okay. Turning to the outlook, 16% to 18% adjusted EPS growth in 2018. That's just head and shoulders above our peer group. Reported sales growth is around 8% with the acquisitions. Organic sales is 3%, very consistent to what you just saw on the previous page. Gross margin is flat. We can attack that a little bit. But in a world where you're hearing from all of our peers about negative gross margin, we're actually proud that this is a flat number. Commodity headwinds and transportation headwinds at around 50 basis points to 70 basis points, offset by productivity and some help from volume and mix, but again gross margin being flat for the year. Marketing flat. SG&A is up year-over-year. That's really what you saw in Q4, the acquisition, full-year impact of those dollars. Operating margin slightly down. And as a result, other expense is minus $70 million. That's largely the interest expense from the $1.4 billion that we took out earlier in the year. And then, the effective tax rate 24% to 25%, that's a range with the new tax act. And there's a range there, because as we go through the year and regulation becomes clearer, we will tighten that range. And then, EPS is 16% to 18%. And I just want to be clear on this slide, because I know there are some questions. But absent tax reform, we would have been 9% EPS growth, right. I just want to be clear on that. Okay. Looking at the track record from 2013 to 2018, 3% or higher typically organic sales growth, and 2018 is no different. Focus on gross margin, we've had a steady run-up over the past few years. We have a great productivity program. We think that's going to continue to pay dividends in the future. I talked about commodities a little bit. But resin and surfactants, we said maybe a quarter ago that we thought that we're going to have recovery in the back half. Resins and surfactants are up around mid-single-digits, whereas diesel is up in the teens. Polypro as an example or a type of resin is up 20% on a spot basis, so just some headwinds there. Transportation, you've heard in a lot of different calls as well. Just the industry in general is tightening, right, capacity is tight. So, these costs are our headwinds. But as I said before, we think that with all the great work we're doing internally that we're going to make sure the gross margin is flat year-over-year. Marketing spend is key, that drives consumer behavior at the end of the day, and we make sure we invest a lot of money there. Remember, we were one of the top 20 largest advertisers in the U.S. SG&A management, we haven't lost our way. This is the hallmark of the company. This is in our DNA. SG&A management is really important to us. This is really mostly due to acquisitions and non-cash charges, and this is what the next slide shows. We're largely flat as you go through history, if you strip out some of those non-cash charges. So, then the end message is a great one, strong adjusted EPS growth, double-digits, 16% to 18% in 2018. One thing that many of our long-term investors get is how much cash flow we do generate. If you look at revenue, we're always maybe one of the smaller companies, around $4 billion in 2018 in the peer set. But if you turn and look at cash, free cash flow conversion, we're typically near the top of the chart. And so, we've had a great ability in the past, and we think we have a great one in the future too to generate cash. We do this a few different ways. Cash conversion cycle, our working capital management has gone from 52 days to 18 days over time, right. So, we continue to believe that we have goals of zero working capital. We have a strong balance sheet. Despite doing the acquisitions this year, we're still around 2.5 times. We have a belief that by the end of 2018 that we'll be at or below 2 times levered. And so, when you hear that, number one, prioritized uses of cash flow is TSR-accretive M&A. And as Matt said, today, we have 11 or 12 power brands and we're looking for 20 in the future. So, number one is accretive M&A. Number two is debt reduction, right. We've moved that up the list as we bring that net leverage ratio down. New product development, CapEx, and then return cash to shareholders. We're not a capital-intensive company either. We're about 1.7%. It bumped up a little bit in 2018 in the outlook as we bought Waterpik. And then, in addition, we have good news on the dividend, a 14% increase in the dividend in 2018, 117 consecutive years, so just a bedrock. And with that, I'd like to invite the rest of management team to come up, and we'll answer any of your questions.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right, don't be bashful, come on up. Okay. Let me tell you who is with us here today, so if you want to direct your questions, we got, you know Rick; you know Lou Tursi, who runs our Sales Organization. We have Carlos Linares, who runs R&D; and we have Rick Spann, who runs Supply Chain. And here, we have Patrick, who's our General Counsel. Britta, you know is our Chief Marketing Officer; Judy Zagorski, Head of HR. We have Scott, who presented on Animal Productivity; and you know Steve runs International. So, floor is open for questions. Okay, Kevin?
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. I wanted to start, Matt, with your take on the pricing environment. There's been a lot of discussion on it in the marketplace. We've had a lot of disappointing results from some of your peers. Your quarter was actually quite good in that respect. So, a couple of questions related to that. How are the pricing discussions going? I understand that you guys often don't lead in terms of when pricing is taken in the industry. But I guess what investors are wrestling with, has something changed here within the construct of private label, within what's going on with Walmart and Amazon. Is there less ability to take pricing? Do brands seem to matter less? Is that what's causing some of the perhaps reluctance to take pricing at this point? And then, maybe you could just sort of wrap into that, how much pricing, if any, is baked into your 3% guidance for fiscal 2018. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I'll try to remember your six questions, so I can get them in order. Well, for starters, you've heard Rick comment about the trend in price, if you look at our organic number, so there was a big price in Q2, less in Q3, less in Q4. So, the trend is favorable. Second thing is commodities. When you have that kind of commodity pressure, that should tamper everyone's appetite to drop price and to compete on price. A third thing I would say is that generally when it comes to price, you really need to have a pretty significant position in a category. So, for baking soda, we have a 75% share, condoms 70% share, those you might expect, you might be able to take some price. But generally, you need the story behind it. For condoms, it would have to be latex cost. You get the idea. So, if you look at us, I said earlier on that we don't have as much exposure to private label. On a weighted average basis, we're around 10% to 11%. So, we don't have the same story as others. And I'll ask Lou if he wants to comment about any conversations we're getting from our retail partners.
Louis H. Tursi, Jr. - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Kevin, what I would say is the environment really hasn't changed all that much. It's never easy to take price in any year. I would start by saying that. I would agree with everything that Matt said that sequentially between Q2, Q3 and Q4, the promotional environment has gotten better. For all the reasons Matt said, we're expecting, in 2018, nothing much to change. As far as the promotional environment goes, I would say it's still high, right. It's not low. It's still high. But sequentially, it's gotten a little bit better. And with the commodity cost going up, it should temper the situation and kind of calm it down a little bit.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'd add is from the outlook perspective, it's largely volume driven in terms of organic growth.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Jason?
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Maybe talking on the gross margin a little bit, the confidence you have in the flat gross margin outlook. So, I know we've talked about – maybe you talk about where you're locked into some of your commodity costs, the Good to Great program. And then, is pricing – kind of dovetailing off of Kevin's question, is that still an option if commodity costs still run a little bit higher? So, just looking at the HPC landscape and the confidence you have that flat is the right number.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, I'm going to let Rick – the two Ricks comment on that. But I'll begin by saying that we have a very robust Good to Great program. So, our continuous improvement program, we're already working on 2019, and we could tell you what programs we have in 2019. Sometimes when you're debottlenecking things, you have to do one thing before you do the next. So, we know going into the year that we have things to offset commodity increases. The second thing is, yeah, we do have a hedging program, and I can ask Rick to comment on that.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. From a gross margin perspective, we're about 50% hedged on our key commodities. We have seven of them that we track all the time. I walked you through some of the movements in key commodities. But the other tailwind we have is some of the mix is, I think, going our way with – as the personal care business has continued to improve over time. So, that's going to help. I'll let Rick opine on the G2G program, but we've had some great incremental steps in our productivity program.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Rick, maybe you can comment on opportunities in the supply chain.
Rick Spann - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, we are certainly renewing our focus on the Good to Great program. We are exploring areas that – where we felt as though the pipeline had gone dry. But now with some changes in our focus, we're able to dig into new areas to increase our delivery on Good to Great. So, as Matt said, the pipeline, we're looking at a pipeline through 2019, and of course, focusing this year on bringing home a good delivery of savings in 2018.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Bill?
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Bill Chappell, SunTrust. I had two questions. One on the International, just maybe a little more color – I don't know what the old Evergreen Model was for International, but maybe you didn't change your overall model. So, maybe help me understand where you come up with 6% from developing versus developed and then how does that affect. Is that assuming that the U.S. Consumer – maybe is it slower than it used to be over the long-term? And then, the second question just on new products. I guess in the past, the presentations have been much more focused on a pretty robust big new products, everything from the CLUMP & SEAL to Oxi detergent to what have you. This seems to be a year of maybe more smaller innovation. Is that the right way to look at it, where you're putting more of the marketing behind just kind of the brands and categories versus big new innovation?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. I'll comment on the Evergreen Model. I'll have Steve and Britta comment on both International and the new products. The Evergreen Model once upon a time was 3% to 4%, if you went back 10 years. And that, a couple of years ago, became 3%. So, that was Evergreen Model 1.0. So, we're a lot more granular now with respect to how we're going to grow in the future. And we have the luxury of having an International business growing 6% and a more balanced animal productivity business that can grow 5%. That takes a lot of the pressure off the U.S. business. So, that's why the way to think about it is U.S. is 2%, International 6% and Specialty Products is 5%. I'll let Steve comment further on his confidence in the 6%.
Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, I'm certainly very confident in the 6%. I made several mention of that. But I think back to Matt's point, they were banging around that 4%, 4%-plus over time, and I think that simply because the U.S. represented such an opportunity and was growing much faster. And so, all the time and attention largely went to the Domestic business. Not until we really changed the strategy, did we say, jeez, we really think we can really fundamentally change our participation in the International marketplace and really get behind very strong growth. And we wanted to prove that, one, to ourselves first that we had strategies that we could rely on, depend on, and then build enough scale that really is material for the company. So, I think we've done that. To your question in terms of – certainly emerging markets are going to play a much bigger role in driving growth. Our Asia-Pac business will be growing very strong, we expect that, for next year and beyond. Certainly, the developed markets, the traditional markets, Europe for example is not going to grow nearly as strong as – whether it be any of our LatAm businesses or Asia-Pacific businesses. So, it is going to be weighted that way.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Now, back to your question about new products, the one thing you got to keep in mind is go back to what we said. So, SLIDE was a fabulous product for us in 2017 and took share. So, we're going to ride that even harder next year. And you were talking about laundry detergent. We are rocking in Pods. So, what happened in Pods the last two quarters, there were 3% growth. We're growing double-digit in Pods, and we have a lot of runway to go there. So, we had some new products in 2017 in both the litter and the detergent, and we see a lot of good things ahead for us in both those categories. Britta, do you have anything to add on the new products?
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, I definitely want to add something. So, mea culpa, normally at this point, we're showing you the TV commercials of the new product, and that's maybe why you have the impression that we are not giving it the same full support, mea culpa, because we haven't got them ready yet. So, what you will see soon is exciting news and TV commercials for the new product, which I hope will reinforce your confidence that we give it full support, we're very excited.
Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah...
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: ODOR BLASTERS will be a blast.
Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I'd like to build too. So, I wouldn't look at it the kind of the way you worded it. I would look at it more this way. Every once in a while, you get surprised with an innovation. SLIDE would be one. So, now we're expanding the distribution of SLIDE year two. We launched ODOR BLASTERS in the laundry detergent last year and didn't really fully capitalize on how big of an idea that was. Batiste is a growing monster, and we have a lot of distribution to continue to gain. So, those are examples that I would say there's a lot of opportunity through the innovation that we've launched on how we can expand that moving forward.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Joe (01:02:07)?
Unknown Speaker: Thanks, Matt. So, both you and Rick mentioned earlier today that ex tax, you guys would be growing the top line 3% organic and EPS 9%. I guess the delta in terms of the investments that you're investing back in the business is about $0.10. So, A, why aren't we seeing faster growth this year? I know there's a lag time between those investments and faster growth. Or B, is it that you have to reinvest that $0.10 every year going forward to still get that 3% top line? Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: The way you should look at that is – and if you're listening today, we have a lot of opportunities here to reinvest. So, you heard about International and you heard about digital. We're maintaining our marketing spend at 12%. It would naturally be lower because Waterpik has a much lower spend. You heard about animal productivity and our expansion there. So, that spend is a permanent spend. So that's going to help fuel us in the future. And in a way you answered your question, Jo, and that it takes a little bit of time, but healthy companies can approach the tax cut very differently than others. So it gives you degrees of freedom and start looking ahead not to 2018, but 2019 and 2020, and that is how we're looking at it. And if you listen to the things I just described where we can put the money, we will make the right choices to sustain our model going forward.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: The analogy I use sometimes is M&A. And sometimes people who have a base business is going backwards has to do a bad deal, that's a reach for something. And so, that's never been the case here. Our business is performing very well, we just had a great quarter, great end of the year. And those are the investments from the same concept as we want to make sure the algorithm is bulletproof 10 years later.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Steve?
Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean to build on that though, should we be thinking about this as an – this extra investment in 2018, is that insurance policy against 2019/2020 and beyond or should we expect a return on this investments such that we get an acceleration of the algorithm in 2019/2020, question one. Question two is, free cash flow conversion expectation for next year, that'd be helpful. And question three for Lou is if the categories are growing, I think it was 2.7%, 3%, you're growing with those categories presumably maybe even a little bit faster than at the shelf, but you're also getting distribution gains, why is the call 3% and not better. Those are my three. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. If you look at our history, this is not a company you want to bet against. So we deliver on our commitments. And our commitments to our shareholders have been that we're going to drive that Evergreen model year after-year-after-year. So, we're going to make investments this year we're going accelerate investments that we might have done over maybe the next two years to three years. We're not prepared today to say suddenly we're changing our model and now we're going to have much higher top line and bottom line. The people who invest in this company are taking a five-year view and they have confidence that we can nail that for the next five years, and that's why they invest in us.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The other comment I'd add to that is, we always measure ourselves versus our peer group as well. So ex-tax reform, if we're around 9% EPS growth, then the peer group's 4.5%. If post-tax reform we're 16% to 18%, the peer group is 6.5%, 7%. So, we feel very happy and very satisfied with where we're at on that sliding scale. Your free cash flow conversion question, on average, we've averaged around 120% free cash flow conversion. That will dip down because of the new tax law, right. Cash tax rate and book rate converge over time. So, if I was doing a model, I'd probably model it around 110%.
Louis H. Tursi, Jr. - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: On the shelf, I really go and doing this for 14 years. I think hopefully you will agree that we live by the commitment almost like the Eagles, where we're the underdogs and we like to deliver. Building on what Matt said, there is – you'd never hear me talk about destocking, you never hear me talk about hurricanes, you never hear me bring up anything like that. We are consistent. We put a number out there that we believe we can hit under all conditions and we deliver it.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Hey, Caroline.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Just thinking through your margin, what is the impact of international and the animal feed growing faster than your base business? Number one.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, the good news is over time those gross margins are converging on actually the company gross margin. So it's not that different for international to the corporate gross margin. The productivity business – animal productivity business does have a little bit lower gross margin, but some of those recent deals we've done have margins in the 60s and 70s, right. And so those are really the fast growing business as well. So, I'd say, minimal impact overall of those two divisions growing faster.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. And if I just could ask on Waterpik, how much of the business is the sort of one-time purchase of the equipment? And how much is recurring service sort of replacement blade idea? And how do you see that changing over time?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You're talking about CapEx?
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: No, I'm talking about the consumer purchase, the blade and razor idea? Are you with Waterpik selling...
Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Today, 100% of that business is just the equipment. The example that I showed on the screen, the whitening one, and maybe Britta wants to talk a little bit about that, that is the first entrance into like a refillable type of scenario.
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So we're learning lots about Waterpik. And I think we would struggle with exactly the questions you have. So, actually different households act differently. We have a few people, maybe some of them in the room. They buy it once, and that's it. But we obviously also have a lot of dedicated families where we can see the first family member has one and then they actually extend it over the family. So if you look at households, there is repeat purchase. And then of those people who actually get into the habit of using it, we also see that people renew the models. There is a constant upgraded improvement, and also we are branching out into areas, which you might have seen the latest models are extremely Silicon Allegan. There's something like bathroom aesthetics. So people buy those, or we are now launching a model, which is a travel model for those people who cannot be without that fresh and clean feeling. So, there's lots of opportunities to either extend into more households. Household penetration currently is only around 16%, electric toothbrushes is around 40%, so huge household penetration opportunity. Secondly, more devices per household; thirdly upgrades per household; and then as I said fourthly, this is early days. My expectation, I have some background in razors and blades is that the first product we launch will not be the success on the replenishing model, but over time, we will get it right, and then life gets really exciting.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: My last question is most important, can you scrape our bodies the way you do the chickens and figure out how to give us the right probiotic.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I'm sure somebody is working on that, okay. Yeah. Over here.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks. I have a question on your probiotic or vitamin business. You guys put a slide up there where you show that you've lost share and it's the first time in the last few years. So could you drill down a little bit more on what are the key drivers of that share loss, the competitive environment? And then what's your outlook for that business this year? And is your goal to stabilize share and how do you expect to accomplish that? Is it through innovation, stepped up spending, promos for instance behind that business.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. You're talking about the gummy vitamin business.
Unknown Speaker: Yeah.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, let me just start, I'm going to hand it over to Britta. The way to think about that is that the category continues to grow double digit. So although we may not be growing at double digit, our consumption continues to grow. So, the business continues to grow. And when we bought that business, it had six competitors, today it has 30. So, there are a lot of people that are piling in there. So it's a growing category, grows double digit, we continue to grow. I think what will happen over time frankly is that there will be a shakeout, and it's not going to happen this year or the next year, but generally retailers can sustain that many brands on the shelf. Britta, you can add that?
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, building on that what you saw was AOC share Nielsen. Nielsen in this category only covers 70% of the market. I just talked about how much and that we have market dominance on Amazon. So actually if you put those together, our share picture would be much more positive, first of all. Second, we do have innovations, and third, we are absolutely confident we will grow that.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Over here, Peg (01:11:23).
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. So, maybe just going back to the international segment, I was curious, clearly, you guys are doing well with Amazon in the domestic segment. Are you able to leverage your Amazon relationship and maybe some of the other retail partners as you grow internationally?
Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I would say that we're doing just that, Actually both in Canada and Europe, where Amazon is making significant investments. And we're taking the learnings that the domestic team has and applying them in our international markets. I would put Costco in that category as well – strong, global, retailer, and we're very successful with them in many parts of the world.
Unknown Speaker: And then if I could just go into the slide before in your online sales growth. I think your online sales are now 5% of your sales. Is your online penetration continues to increase, are you seeing any impact on your gross margins?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The good news is across the portfolio largely gross margins online and in bricks-and-mortars are very similar. So, no, we're not.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. This way, Peg (01:12:30). Olivia, right there.
Unknown Speaker: Olivia.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Thanks. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the latest and greatest in the laundry category. And then also in terms of 2018, can we talk about the component of volume versus price mix? And then just lastly in terms of M&A, you talked about gross margin and the importance of that, but both Waterpik and vitamins were gross margin dilutive. So, can you marry some of the comments around M&A and the importance of gross margin? Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. You started off with the laundry category. So, the laundry category in the fourth quarter was flattish. It was less promotional frankly sequentially. So, that's all good news. If you look at the brands in the categories that are doing really well, one would be ARM & HAMMER. So, we've grown – no surprise, ARM & HAMMER grew in the fourth quarter and also on a full-year basis. So, that is our flagship brand in detergent. Within the category deep value was (01:13:33) struggling. So, that would be brands like our brand Xtra, Sun and Purex. So, all three of those brands lost share last year. So, that's – so Xtra is a leaky bucket for us, but the combination of our three brands ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN and Xtra, we grew share in – I think we're up 50 basis points or 60 basis points of share all in, in the laundry category. And Pods, I mentioned earlier, I said Pods has slowed down quite a bit in last two quarters. We continue to grow double digit.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And in terms of price mix and volume for the organic call (74:12), I kind of touched on that before, it's largely volume-based. I'm not going to go into too much more detail, but it's largely volume-based. We probably have some positive mix offsetting any price as personal care continues to do well. And then, I think your third question was, was it gross margin with acquisitions, with M&A?
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: (01:14:30-01:14:39)
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Just, you know, our aspiration to gross margin accretion from every M&A deal we do, right. That's definitely the goal. Waterpik is, I'd say largely neutral to gross margin. We think over time, right, we said when we made that announcement in August that we're going to spend around $10 million in 2018 to get $10 million of synergies in 2019. So, I'd expect in 2019 for some of the gross margin to be a little bit more accretive for Waterpik. So, remember just like the Avid deal, when we did, vitamins, when we bought the business, it was a 38% gross margin, and we got up to 45% over two years, and that was part of Matt's slide on how we expand gross margin and just the run way for productivity, so.
Scott Druker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And the only thing I would add too from a retailer shelf standpoint, as powder continues to decline, the powder shelf space will continue to decline. And liquid and unit dose is doing well. So you'll see the powder space will move to unit dose and liquid.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Couple more, over here, Peg (01:15:43).
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Thanks. Jonathan Feeney, Consumer Edge. Walmart's made a lot of noise about a lot of categories about on-time and in-full, how they're managing their logistics. Could you comment maybe about logistics broadly for 2018, those cost, and any particular categories you've had to think differently about deliveries maybe extra expense, and maybe why you don't seem to be as impacted as some others? I know Clorox, it was pretty big impact. They weren't able to get a lot of product to market. Why are you able to succeed so much better and presumably as you're talking about 2018 continue to do that? Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, well, I'll say a few words and if there's anything Rick wants to add, he can. Yeah, as far as trucking and the shortage of truckers, that's pretty much common knowledge. So, we got out ahead of that in November, and we worked with our carrier partners to ensure that we were going to have trucks available and be able to keep up our fabulous record on on-time performance. And we would expect to do that again in 2018 with our transportation partners. (01:16:58) to add to that?
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. The only thing I would add, Matt, is that, we have over 100 carriers that we work with, but 10 of those deliver 80% of our product, of our volume. And so, we were able to partner very closely with those 10 and we've been able to ensure that we had adequate supply of containers and drivers, so we've been ahead of the curve there, as Matt said.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Jason?
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Jason English, Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on a good quarter. I had a couple of questions, maybe the first for Britta or Lou, I'm not sure which. Personal care had a bit of a tough year, but finished on a really strong note, can you give us some of the underlying drivers of what drove the acceleration of fourth quarter and lay out maybe where your expectations are as we head into the new year?
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, if you ask me, of course, it's great advertising.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: That's right.
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. I think that we did do – so, yeah, absolutely. I think one of the things we're finding is, when we talked about category growth early as well, there's, a, some of our categories like condoms where we talked for long time, young people are, with absolute number declining, are having less sex, we heard all about that I think several times, and they're moving online, right. So, these are things which are difficult to scale. I think we have great campaigns in place now. Same for vitamins, I think we've seen a clear up-tick on our vitamin campaign, Vitamin Better. So, I would say we are driving those sales, particularly in the later quarter and we've also put some investments behind it.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Just to echo what Britta said, it was really broad-based in the personal care business, it was across many different brands. So, just a good combination of innovation over the long-term and great advertising.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You had a second one?
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I do. I want to come back and try to beat the gross margin horse again. First, can you help us maybe unpack the fourth quarter a bit? It was pretty strong, your 60 basis point full-year commodity drag I think suggests maybe around 140 basis point drag in the fourth quarter, is that kind of right and do you expect something similar to next year? And then the last couple of quarters, not the fourth quarter, because you know the detail, I know M&A was a positive 100 bps contribution third quarter, plus 70 bps in the second quarter, what if anything did it add in the fourth, and are we looking for a similar sort of contribution to help us sort of bridge our way to flat in the face of, what looks like it's going to be a fairly onerous commodity environment next year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, lot of details in there. I'd say in general in Q4, I think we had around 70 basis points help from acquisitions offset by maybe price mix of minus 30 basis points, minus commodities of, not 140 basis points, but maybe 40 basis points or 50 basis points, and then positives from price mix, I mean mix really. You're right, we've had some benefit in 2017 from M&A on the gross margin line, and conversely, we've had some negative help from the SG&A line for these same acquisitions. So, I think it's kind of neutral on an operating margin basis. In 2018, we expect 0 to 10 basis points from M&A. So, it is not a tailwind in 2018. What I talked about earlier was personal care, the fact that we've hedged, the fact that we have a great productivity program, so those are kind of what's going on.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Peg (01:20:34)
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. So I wanted to just go back to Jason's question, as you look into outlook for 2018, you mentioned like M&A would not be a tailwind, but I wanted to basically if you can put it in as a ranking, let's say, you mentioned that the mix International wouldn't affect you that much. So maybe like you're going to be investing more in innovation this coming year or you're seeing more of the raw materials had rolling over into 2018. So, we're going to feel more of the impact of the raw materials into 2018. So if you can kind of help us elaborate or on an EBITDA basis you actually would see margins expand, so excluding the non-cash charges? And the second question will be on sexual health, I think she alluded to improving trends, but if you can comment on the 3%, if you're assuming market share gains, market share will actually improve on a total channel basis when you include in also Internet. Thank you.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And maybe I'll take the gross margin, and you could take the revenue.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Maybe I'll do the sexual health one. And you can think about that extended gross margin multifaceted question. So, as far as sexual health goes, so you probably heard us talk about in previous calls that people are having less sex. And also there is also prevalence of other alternatives. So for example the IUDs, Plan B et cetera. So, all of that is contributing to the category. Another thing I would point out is demographics. So, if you look at the 18 to 24 year old population today versus where it was, say, four, five years ago, it's smaller and that's not going to turn around till 2021. So, there is lots of things that are influencing the sales of condoms in the United States, but we have 70% share, so we certainly like our chances in the future and we're in it for the long term. And Britta, do you have anything to add to them?
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I just want to add, I think actually our toy business is going very well. So, those people who are having sex are having more fun.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And then...
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, did I give you enough time, Rick?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. A lot of focus on gross margin, I guess, right. In the industry, there is a lot of pressure on gross margins, so I get the question, right. I would have said back in August, if I gave you a gross margin outlook, it would have been positive 30 basis points to 40 basis points. And so, we're well positioned and a lot of those things are structural, right. A lot of the G2G productivity programs we've had in place for years now, that are coming to fruition now. We were hedged last year about 50%, we're hedged this year about 50%. There is no turnover that's happening on resin per se that's causing us any flux.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: (01:23:32)
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, it's a fair point that if it was that material, then yes, that would happen. But resins, I think it sometimes is overblown for Church & Dwight, how material it is. It's not like a Clorox in the Glad trash bag business. We have resin in laundry bottles, yeah we do, but it's not as exposed that I think we could ask about it. So, it's one of the seven, it's probably one of the top four, but it's not the number one. So, I don't know if there is any other questions besides that, but really, and we have a lot of confidence in 2018 margin because of the productivity programs that we've done about for a year or two, because of the personal care mix coming. We still launch accretive new products, we haven't changed that. We still aim to launch accretive new products with innovation, right, SLIDE is a great example, Clump & Seal is a great example. We're moving up the litter category, units aren't really going up, but the price premium for the consumer is.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. So, we've been at this for a good while now. Of course, we only have the room for so long. I just want to thank everybody for coming today. The team that you see up here is representative of the kind of talent that we have at the Church & Dwight, and we are very confident in our future. And I think you would all have to agree that what we're calling for 2016 is head and shoulders over our peer group. Thanks for coming.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that, on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in the detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, today. I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is finished, we'll have a Q&A session. So reported growth was 11.2%, which reflects strong organic growth and the Waterpik acquisition. We're very pleased with the organic sales growth of 3.2%. That was driven by 7.1% volume growth domestically. Our targeted investment spending has translated into share growth, as 7 out of our 11 power brands exceeded or met category growth. Both the International Consumer business and the Specialty Products business turned in really strong numbers. We're on track to achieve 8.5% full year earnings growth. Our International Consumer business exceeded our expectations with 6.2% organic growth. As you know, we continue to invest in our international business to sustain our long-term algorithm of 6% organic growth. Last year, we opened new offices in Singapore and Panama to support our export business. In August of this year, we established a new subsidiary in Germany to expand our European business. And over the last 12 months, we have been taking a hard look at Asia and the best approach to that region. There will be a lot more to come on this topic in the future. Our Specialty Products business had a strong quarter with 7.5% organic growth. U.S. dairy farm profitability remains at a higher level than a year ago. We are starting to get more traction outside of dairy in poultry and cattle. The acquisition of the Agro BioSciences business earlier this year is an important building block for animal productivity business. We've seen good growth for the probiotics products – that's a tongue twister. We have seen good growth for the probiotics products in the poultry industry and our new business development efforts in the dairy industry are translating into new sales. Turning, now, to some of our domestic categories, the laundry category declined 30 bps in Q3, driven by higher promotional levels and slower unit dose category growth, yet our laundry business grew 380 basis points in consumption. Once again, we were able to grow share in the quarter. That momentum has carried into October – and by the way, October promotional levels have also come back in line. ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent grew share for the 31st consecutive quarter. OXICLEAN laundry detergent gained share sequentially with improved efficacy claims and packaging. And now, finally, unit dose, behind our new Triple Chamber unit dose innovation, our consumption has outpaced the unit dose category rate for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Q3, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew six times the category rate. Our total unit dose share, all in for all brands, is now 4.9%. In litter, the clumping litter category grew 4.6%, and the ARM & HAMMER consumption grew 5.4% and gained share. Our new litter innovation, SLIDE, has already reached 4% share (3:47) of the clumping litter segment and we grew share 60 bps in the quarter. SLIDE has a greater six-month repeat customer purchase rate than the last 14 category launches that we've had, except for Clump & Seal, which is slightly better. So, we feel good about the future of the SLIDE product. The dry shampoo category grew 33% in Q3. The dry shampoo category is now $140 million in the U.S. BATISTE grew 9.5 share points to a 33% share. BATISTE has the strongest brand loyalty of any dry shampoo in the category, including brands with significant hair care heritage. Now turning to gummies, the adult gummy category grew 13% in the quarter, while our business grew consumption approximately 2%. vitafusion, which is our adult gummy business, is contending with significant competitive discounting. There's been a lot of BOGOs going on in gummy vitamins. We haven't been participating, so that's been slowing our growth. The condom category declined in consumption by 2.7% in the quarter. TROJAN Condom share in measured channels was down, although some of that is offset by online consumption. As we discussed in our Q2 call, younger people are having less sex, plus we're seeing an increase in use of non-latex condoms. Innovation is always a catalyst to category growth. Our new XOXO condom, which is geared towards women, is going very well. Finally, we closed the Waterpik acquisition in the quarter. We were attracted to Waterpik because it has a bright future as consumer awareness of the importance of gum health continues to grow. Next up is Rick to give you some details on Q3 results and the outlook for the rest of the year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49 per share compared to $0.47 in 2016, up 4% excluding a $0.03 tax benefit from reversal of a tax reserve related to a prior-year joint venture impairment charge. The $0.49 was better than our $0.46 outlook, largely due to some help from tax, better gross margin and lower SG&A. Reported revenues were up 11.2% to $968 million, organic sales were 3.2%. Weather-related hurricane disruptions negatively impacted organic growth by approximately 20 basis points for the quarter. Now, let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic business organic sales increased 2.2% driven by higher volume; growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, cat litter and baking soda; BATISTE dry shampoo; and, OXICLEAN stain fighters. Volume growth was 7%, offset by negative price mix of 5%. In terms of negative price, this reflected higher promotional levels, NPD support, lower personal care versus household growth, all of which we expect to improve in Q4. And as Matt said, October is off to a good start. International organic growth was up an impressive 6.2%, broad-based across the globe. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 7.5% due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business. Turning to gross margin, our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 45.3%, a 10 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was a bit better than we originally expected, despite the impact of the hurricanes, largely due to continued productivity improvements and better margin on International and SPD. The Q3 gross margin decline breaks out as follows. We had higher volumes and promotional levels in Q3; netted, that was a drag of 100 basis points, improvement of 100 basis points due to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, productivity programs helped by 30 basis points, and FX was a slight drag of 10 basis points. Finally, commodities were a 30 basis point drag on the quarter. I know a lot has been said on resin and, while spot prices of ethylene-based derivatives like resin and surfactants increased between 10% and 20% in the quarter, our impact was, in part, mitigated by our hedging program. Moving, now, to marketing, marketing as a percent of revenue was 11.6%. If we exclude Waterpik, we were up 60 basis points versus a year ago. Remember, in previous years, the big spend quarters were Q2 and Q4. This year we concentrated our spend in Q2 and Q3 to better support innovation. Our Q4 spending levels look a lot like Q3. SG&A as a percent of net sales was 13.2%, a 160 basis point increase, of which 100 basis points is attributed to acquisition transition and amortization costs. Base SG&A is up due to higher R&D and legal spending. Now, to operating profit, the adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20.5%, which reflects marketing shift and higher SG&A from recent acquisitions. Other expense was $11.7 million, primarily driven by $14.4 million of interest. Next, the income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 28.7%, which includes a 400 basis point benefit due to the reversal of a joint venture tax reserve. Excluding that reserve reversal, the effective rate in the quarter approximates our full year adjusted rate of 33%. Turning to cash, we generated approximately $424 million of net cash for the first nine months, $70 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of accounts receivable factoring, the higher deferred compensation payments and higher inventories. This was partially offset by higher cash earnings. Full year cash from Ops is expected to be approximately $650 million. So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include strong share growth driven by growth in the Domestic business, continued expansion of our International Consumer business and strong growth in our SPD division. Turning to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 2.5% as we ramp down MPD promotional support and our Personal Care business sequentially improves. The early read for October is category growth is stronger, promotional levels are down a bit and our Personal Care business is off to a good start. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.50 compared to $0.44 a year ago, or a 14% increase year-over-year. And turning to the full year, we're adjusting our expectations for organic sales growth to 2.5%. We continue to expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth, or $1.92 per share. And as a reminder, acquisitions are EPS neutral for the year. We expect approximately $605 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $45 million of CapEx for the full year. This represents in excess of 120% free cash flow conversion. And finally, we all know that tax reform's a moving target. The company believes that the most meaningful aspect is a lower corporate tax rate. And as a reminder, over 80% of our business is based in the U.S. from a revenue perspective, but 90% of our profits come from the U.S. So now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Actually, this is Stephanie on for Bill. My question is actually just looking for a little bit more color on the international business; definitely, outperformed and exceeded our expectations despite the tough comp. So maybe if you could just give some color on kind of which brands are doing better, or is it – what you're seeing there? And then, obviously, your comment on expanding more in Asia, just color there would be helpful. Thanks so much.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We said on prior calls that our – the three big brands that generally drive the international business are STERIMAR, BATISTE and – I forgot the third one. FEMFRESH, yeah. STERIMAR, BATISTE and FEMFRESH. In addition to that, in North America, ARM & HAMMER has been growing really well for us, ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, both in Canada and in Mexico. You know, as far as the business goes, the business is extremely healthy and we've had broad-based growth across virtually all of our countries in the third quarter. As I said before, our long-term algorithm is for the international business to grow 6% annually, and we're confident that we can deliver that. As far as my comments earlier about Asia, so Asia-Pacific is extremely attractive to us. It has a growing middle class. I mean, the countries we'd be most interested there would be Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand. And with a growing middle class using increasing consumption of personal care products, and our products are under-represented there, so we're looking at consolidating our resources in that area, making more investments in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: I'm sorry. I apologize if I missed it. Did you guys comment on the 50 basis points lower outlook on organic sales for the year? So, it was approximately 3% before; now, we're down to 2.5%. I know you had a little bit of hurt from the hurricane in the quarter, but fairly modest in the quarter, so even less – far less material for the year. Can you comment on that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. You're only the second question in, Kevin, so you didn't miss it. So, our categories in the first half of the year grew 1.5%. That's ticked down a bit in the third quarter; a little over 1% for our categories, so – and we expect the same for Q4, and I think that's reflected in our full year call, up 2.5%. The other piece of that is international. International has had big growth for three quarters. They're going to be much lower in the fourth quarter, and that's – it can be somewhat lumpy in international, and one of the reasons for that is because of export. We have lots of different countries, so it doesn't always come in that evenly. It's no reflection of our long-term expectation of international, but international will be part of the story for the fourth quarter and why we'd be a little bit short.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: So, Matt, was there a little bit of timing just to clean that up? Was there a little bit of timing that helped international in the quarter, because you guys are running ahead, I guess, of where you had guided for the year in international?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, we came in at 6% – 6% and change organic for the quarter for international. It's early – we had a big first quarter for international, so it's a little bit lumpy. So, it'll be our lowest quarter of the year, but it's just going to fall over into 2018.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And even on a stack basis in Q4, Kevin, we're still in the low-teens for the international business, so it's not like it's dropping off the face of the earth.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. No, no, no. Understood. Thanks, Rick. Two more quick ones for me. Waterpik, did you guys provide a growth rate in the quarter? I know you're guiding to 4%, but it's been growing 10%, historically, so I think a growth rate in the quarter would help. And then, related to that, what have you learned regarding the business post the close of the deal?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We didn't get into that level of detail as far as the net sales growth in the quarter, but what I can say is – what we had said is it's going to grow above our evergreen target of 4%. The business did perform well in August and September. So, we think that this business is going to be a big part of our story going forward. Some things we've learned, it's a very innovative culture; 20% of the business is online, which might be astonishing to you. It's sort of very sophisticated in how to sell online. I would think international is a big opportunity, because only $50 million of their business is international today. And of course, we have a $700 million business in international. So, we have a lot of leverage that we can help those guys grow their business. So, it's – we're very happy with this acquisition. The integration is going very well. Integration is not dependent upon people as much as it is a focus on how we can leverage the Church & Dwight with the suppliers and, also, the networks that we have internationally to grow their business.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks, Matt. One more, if you guys could comment on the pricing environment; increasingly, discussion is coming up that input costs have sort of reemerged here, but the consumer environment's weak and you guys are even pointing to that with some slower category data. So, what's your expectation here with respect to pricing in Q4? And as we look out to next year, do you see inability to take pricing? Is that something that you would lead in some of your categories? So, any commentary there with respect to the ability to take pricing as input costs inflate here would be helpful. And that's it for me. Thanks guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, tapering pricing in this environment is very difficult. I mean, generally the only categories you're going to be taking price in is where you have a clear number one share, and even then, you need to have a story with respect to input costs. So, that would be, for example, in condoms for latex. So, I think price – pass-through of input costs is generally difficult. Typically, what you see is changing in quantity sizes, in ounces and units in a package, is how you're going to get price.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Very good. Thank you. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for letting me ask a question.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, there.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You can always ask a question, Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I can, but usually there's not always an audience to ask it to. So, I'm trying to understand gross margin a little bit better here, given the magnitude of pricing – negative price drag that rolled through the P&L, only 30 bps of cost inflationary pressure, I think I heard you say, Rick. Can you fill in the holes in terms of the rest of the gross margin bridge, while we wait for your 10-Q to come out and do it for us? And high level, it's hard to get to where you're at without an assumption that there is maybe up to 200 basis points of mix benefit from acquisition that's kind of coming out at the SG&A line. So, A, is that true? If so, it sort of implies underlying base business gross margins are down pretty substantially. Are you still sort of on track? I guess, kind of where I'm getting to is are you still sort of on track to, on an underlying basis, getting the margin expansion you expected at both gross and EBIT? And sorry, long winded, multi-faceted question.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, lots of commas in there, Jason. But...
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, I know. Lots of pauses, commas.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You know, I did go through the gross margin bridge in my prepared comments. I'll rehash it really quick for you, and then talk about the go forward. But we said net of higher volumes and leverage on that, plus promotional levels, was a drag of 100 basis points in the quarter; 100 basis points to the good was the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and productivity programs helped by 30 basis points. Currency was a drag of 10 basis points and commodities were a hurt of 30 basis points. Now, on a go-forward basis, yeah, we are confident that gross margin is expanding. I think for the full year, the number's probably going to fall a little bit closer to the 20% than the 40% that our original outlook was. That's predominantly because of some of the resin costs, right. We do have a great hedging program, but some of that does impact us. We've had some mix headwinds from Personal Care versus Household. But the good news is that in Q4, as you look at our trends of negative price mix over the past couple quarters, we talked about it last call, domestic business in Q2 was down 600 basis points in price mix; this quarter is down 490 basis points. We expect it to be closer to flat, maybe slightly negative, in the fourth quarter. Why? Because a lot of our lower couponing – we have lower couponing around our new products, like the new litter and unit dose are doing well, so the trial generating activities ramp down and some of our promotional levels are being lapped. So, we had negative price in the laundry category a year ago in Q4. And then, we have improved Personal Care performance, as well, expectations in Q4. So, I would say the short answer is we expect the base business gross margin to continue to have momentum. We don't have any expectations for the base gross margin to be going backwards in any way. We continue to think that we have expansion there for next year, for sure.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And do you still expect 30 bps of EBIT margin expansion for the year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: It's kind of fuzzy, because we have three or four metrics that we talk about and go through, with and without Waterpik. I would tell you, including Waterpik, we do not because there is transition and implementation integration costs, but we're slightly positive ex Waterpik.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys. And I know you've kind of talked a little bit about what next year could look like. I know there's an EPS number out there when you did the Waterpik acquisition. I guess I really wanted to focus more on the organic sales. And I mean, good to hear that the promotional environment is coming down a little bit and Personal Care doing a little bit better, but can you – your commentary about category trends, 1%-ish fourth quarter. How are you starting to think about next year? Do you think that we could see outsized growth, again, from international? Do you think Consumer Domestic is – I guess, we're going to have a little bit more of the same promotional changes out there? I was just wondering if you could maybe tease a little bit in terms of how we should be thinking about next year's organic sales growth.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, as you know, Jason, we only give our outlook every February. So, we have no intention of giving a 2018 outlook today. What I can remind everybody of is that we have an evergreen target of 3% organic growth, annually, and that target is based on Domestic growth of 2%, International of 6%, and Specialty Products of 5%. And the Specialty Products of 5% is driven by the fact that, over the last couple years, we bought a couple of businesses, one was VI-COR, the other Agro BioSciences that got us into things other than dairy, so we're expecting a lot of growth from that business going forward.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Maybe if I could just extend it just into, maybe, the Personal Care, since I broached the topic. If you could talk about maybe some of the businesses where, I think, there's some new innovation coming out; just wondering how that's starting to play into consumption trends. If you think about oral or the condom category, obviously, BATISTE is doing well and I know you're saying Personal Care is sounding a little bit better in October, but maybe can you flesh that out a little bit more, which categories where the innovation is resonating, where maybe you're kind of matching promotions on maybe gummies; I'm not sure. Can you talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing, there, that gives you the confidence that Personal Care will be better in the fourth quarter and, hopefully, into next year?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, we're already seeing those trends in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that both vitamin consumption and condom consumption has improved from quarter-to-quarter. Now, we can – it's a little early with respect to answering your fourth quarter question when XOXO could be part of that story for condoms. And obviously, we had some new innovation on the vitamin side of the business. BATISTE, of course, is in dry shampoo, has been a rocket ship for us. You might have probably heard on my comments that that category grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter and, at the same time, we grew share tremendously and we are at 33% share. That's a category that's $140 million. And if it grows as fast as the UK and where the UK levels off, it will be a $300 million category. So it gives you a little bit of color on three categories in Personal Care.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I also wanted to ask about the FY 2018 outlook. And I know you're not looking to provide much detail for next year, but is that $209 million figure still the current thinking for next year or do we have to wait until next year to get an update on that number?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. You have to wait till next year to get an update. There is a – we tried to give some visibility when we had the Waterpik acquisition on how we were thinking about it. There's also lots of puts and takes that we'll talk about in February, and we're going to wait until then to do it, right. Resin keeps coming up, right. And lots of forecasts out there are calling a return to pre-hedge pricing, but you see a lot of our peers taking big call downs in their external outlook. We don't think that's going to happen, for example, but we're not going to go through that level of detail right now in November. We're going to wait until February to give you the full soup-to-nuts forecast that we typically do.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, just going back to the category growth rates, clearly, everyone's speculating on what's driving the slowdown out there. Do you guys have any additional perspectives on the slowdown that you saw in Q3? And then, if there's also – I was just curious if there's any way to quantify the type of uptick you're seeing in October from a category growth rate perspective? Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think the way to think about categories is you got to look at the volumes. So, the volumes are healthy in a lot of categories, so the real story is, when it comes to dollars, it's simply price; and, that's going to vary from category to category. And typically, it's much greater in household categories than it is in personal care, but as long as volumes stay healthy, I think that's a good barometer. So, I don't think that the price is something that is going to last permanently, but certainly it's something we're all dealing with now.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And to answer your other question, Rupesh, in Q3 Matt had said categories – our categories were around 1.1% growth in October, it was closer to 2%, as an example. Why? Because some of the promotional levels weren't as deep and they were lapping some higher promotional levels in Q4 year-ago.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Research (sic) [Consumer Edge Research]. Your line is open.
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Good morning. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. First, I'd love you to comment on your club and e-commerce performance, given that Consumer Domestic tracked just a little bit better than our scan data would have indicated, and maybe what categories are driving that. And a second question, related, on e-commerce, you had mentioned Waterpik's 20% online is a huge number. I think there's some obvious differences in that business that maybe make it more e-com friendly, but they – are there some learnings about Waterpik and some overlap where you can sell – you can learn from that and really advance e-com adoption at some of your other real high-value businesses that might overlap directly? Thanks very much.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. This is Rick. I'll take the first one and Matt will talk about the Waterpik e-commerce. Your questions really shift into consumption. So, consumption was around 2.3% for the quarter. We have a 200 basis point drag from couponing, right. That doesn't get measured in Nielsen-type data and – similar to last quarter. And then, we have 200 basis points of positive from untracked channels, like online and club. We said in the release that our online business was up 70%, for example. That's really VMS, litter and TROJAN are the three – the big ones on online business. So, that's how we get to our shipment number or organic number of around 2.2% for Domestic.
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. As far as your question on Waterpik, as I said before, it's a really impressive group of people that run that business. And when it comes to working online, it's early days, but what we've seen with respect to their development of web pages, the development of content for online, their social listening skills, the fact that they're already focused on Amazon, have sales on Amazon in Europe, they've been in it for – and more sophisticated than we've been for a number of years. So, we do think we can learn a lot from these guys. As far as is there any one specific category that would benefit, I mean, certainly it would be Personal Care more than Household because Personal Care lends itself more to online sales than Household. But it's a good question and we're very happy that these guys are now part of the family.
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Just a few things...
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Caroline.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: ...on the acquisition – Good morning. Thanks. On the acquisition contribution outlook, it just seems that the contribution was bigger than we had expected in the past quarter. So, if you could just give us a sense from a sales standpoint whether you see that Waterpik is coming in ahead of plan? And then, staying with Waterpik, what percent of the sales come from sort of electronic – the gadget part and what percent from the replacement part that's more the annuity business, and just what's the cycle there? Just a little deeper understanding would be really helpful.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Caroline. On the second one, in terms of the mix between units versus replacement, it's predominantly units, okay. It's a very small percentage that's replacements. That's not really as applicable at this time, right. Maybe that'll change one day in the future, but right now, it's largely just the replacement units and it's like a three-year replacement cycle, in general. So that's why innovation is so important, but that's also why category penetration is really the driver behind that business. And then, your first question was on Waterpik and just the contribution. We're not going to give details of the businesses; we just don't. That's not our past practice. We haven't done that with any acquisition, whether it was Avid, Orajel, or OxiClean. I'm trying to be as clear as we can, but for EPS it's a neutral impact for the year and that's what we're going to stick with.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And then, just within the – you touched a little bit on the pricing environment and couponing, but are there any metrics you can put around what's going on in the vitamin business and just help us understand what the – how long this price war might continue?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, look, when it comes to vitamins, the category is healthy. There are a lot more competitors out there right now than when we first bought the business, so there's lots of options for consumers. The space has expanded, as far as when you go on shelf, and the space has expended largely for the existing pill brands that are now creating gummy products and expanding gummy products, like Nature Made, Nature's Bounty, Centrum. And there's a fair amount of brand loyalty when somebody switches from pills to capsules, and BOGOs are exacerbating that transition. So, we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs, which as I said, is affecting our ability to grow. We do have a new ad campaign right now to try to break through the noise in the gummy category and we do expect to be up in the fourth quarter. But yeah, it's concerning and something that we continue to watch, Caroline.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Just lastly on that, is Amazon a major player there? Because one of our fears – and I think investors across the board are just wondering which categories is Amazon going to become a big private label player? And are you seeing them in any of your categories at this point?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. I mean, in gummy vitamins, we're the number one gummy on Amazon. In fact, our shares are super high in Amazon in comparison to what they are in bricks and mortar, so no worries there right now.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Sam Reid - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. This is actually Sam Reid filling in for Bonnie. I actually had a bigger picture question. There's been a lot of talk about private label in many categories across the U.S., but a lot less talk in detergents, which I guess is a clear positive for you guys. Why do you think the detergent category is somewhat immune from private label penetration, at least here in the U.S.? And then, separately, we know that private label detergent shares in places like Europe are significantly higher, at least in the tracked channels. Do you ever see this as a potential risk longer term to the U.S. market?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. The reason for that is private label today in laundry, and has been for a long, long time, is generally mid-tier. It's not a deep value. And if you look at the long-term trends, mid-tier has been the share donor to premium and to value detergent for a long, long time. And the reason you don't have a value in private label is because you already have deep value laundry detergent products on shelf, and so it's very difficult to make any money in deep value and come in as the opening price point below an extreme value laundry detergent. So, yeah, private label laundry detergent really is miniscule in the U.S. for that reason.
Sam Reid - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got you. No, that's really helpful. And then, I just had – I hate to belabor it, but another follow-up question on Waterpik; not about category growth here, though, but more on the showerhead business. What sorts of channel opportunities are you seeing here, specifically, now that you've owned this business for a little while? Just looking for some color there.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I wouldn't say it's a distribution game. It's really more innovation. So, the folks at Waterpik are experts in water jet technology. And just as they have the number one share and really own the water flosser category, they also have the number one share in replacement showerheads. So, there's – regulations typically affect the replacement showerhead business. In other words, the number of gallons per minute, today, generally around 2.0; that's going to go lower in the future. Question is, do you have the technology to deliver the same consumer experience that you did when you had a higher water flow? So, it's – to go back to your question, it's not a distribution game. It's really an innovation game.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I agree with Matt. It's not a distribution game. We are having some early success getting the Waterpik sales team in front of some other customers that we have a larger presence at. So, we're happy about that as part of integration as well.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'll give you an example of innovation. So, one of the new products is a Pet Wand. So, you know that more people have pets than children today, and that continues to grow. So, it's getting behind that particular trend. So, its translating their technology in the shower into a wand for washing your pets.
Sam Reid - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got you, guys. That sounds awesome. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and morning, everybody. Wanted to understand the rationale for the new share repurchase authorization. Anything you're trying to say regarding appetite for M&A just sort of broadly? And I guess, related to that, if larger assets and, like, large assets, sort of equal size assets became available, would you consider something sort of outside the box, like an RMT, to potentially merge with those?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'll take the buyback one and I'll let Matt comment on the RMT-type stuff. This is very in line with our history, right. We've got a $500 million repurchase authorization. We've done that pretty much every other year. It's just in line with our – really capital allocation model; doesn't mean we're going to go spend $500 million next year on share buyback. It just gives us the flexibility and authorization. So, yeah, historical levels that you would expect is what we probably would do in the future, in concert with paying down debt; and, number one priority, also, is going after the right acquisitions.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And to answer your second question, in my time with the company, we have looked at bigger transactions than the Waterpik transaction, which is our most recent one. And as far as other structures go, yeah, we're no strangers to visitors from the major banks coming in, proposing combinations with various companies in the past through other structures, which we'd always be open to to the extent that it is going to create shareholder value. But that's about all I could say.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And just lastly, wanted to go back to the commentary on the promo levels and the view that price volume would sort of normalize in a more traditional way going forward. I guess, how do you think about sort of the puts and takes to that? How quickly can you change the programs that you have in place, should some competitors decide to become more promotional, particularly as category volumes seem to be softening despite, obviously, what you said about the month of October?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. As far as how you react to a competitor move to take price down, typically it's IRCs, immediately redeemable coupons, those are things you can act on pretty quickly. As far as trade deals with the retailers, usually that's going to be six months out.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And we're not saying that we expect to see dramatic improvement in the level of promotion. We're saying that we're starting to lap some of the negative promotion from year ago, some of the couponing spends going down around new products because the trial period has passed, and our mix from Household and Personal Care is improving. So, while October's a good early read, it's also not our expectation that promotional levels go down significantly.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A portion for today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Matt Farrell for closing remarks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today and we'll see everybody in February with the 2018 outlook.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight conference call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, Church & Dwight's financial objectives and forecasts. As you know, risk and uncertainties involved in Church & Dwight's business may affect the matters referred to and forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed and/or indicated by such forward-looking statements. Church & Dwight will be discussing their results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. The company believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of its business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating their business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. See the Appendix in this morning's press release for a reconciliation. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we'll have a Q&A session. We're happy with our organic sales growth of 1.8%. This was in line with our Q2 outlook of approximately 1% to 2%. The 1.8% organic growth was driven by continued strong performance from international consumer business and a return to growth in our Specialty Products business. We have delivered strong first half results and are on track to achieve 3% full-year organic sales growth and 8.5% earnings growth. In the domestic business, market share gains and 6% volume growth reflect the investments made in the quarter. We expected the domestics business to grow less than 1% in Q2, as we increased our trade and promotional spend. Our targeted investment spending translated into share growth as 6 out of 10 power brands exceeded or met category growth. Most important, we succeeded in promoting trial for our new product introductions, which makes us positive about our second half organic sales growth. Our international consumer business exceeded our expectations with 7.4% organic growth. The increase was driven primarily by the export business and strong quarters from Mexico and Australia. We continued to invest in our international consumer business to sustain our strong sales growth. Last year, you may remember we opened new offices in Singapore and Panama to support our export business, and then a few weeks ago, we established a new subsidiary in Germany to expand our European business. Our Specialty Products business had a strong quarter with 9.4% organic growth. The dairy economy is healthy with class III milk prices around $16.50 compared to an average last year of around $15. We're starting to get more traction outside of dairy in poultry and cattle, and in fact a few weeks ago, I visited our new employees at Agro BioSciences in Wisconsin which is the custom probiotics business that we recently acquired and I walked away more excited than ever about the future growth of that business. Turning now to some of our categories and new product launches, the laundry category grew 1.5% in Q2. Our laundry business grew over 9% in consumption. This past quarter we leveled the playing field and increased our trade promotions and couponing to be in line with our competitors. A chunk of the incremental investment was to promote trial of our new product introductions which are the Triple Chamber unit dose and the restage of OXI laundry detergent. We had high promotional effectiveness and we are the only major manufacturer to grow share in the quarter. And once again, ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent grew share for the 30th consecutive quarter. We restaged our OXICLEAN laundry detergent and gained share in Q2 with improved efficacy, claims and packaging. So we've given OXICLEAN laundry detergent a boost with a great new formula that we wanted consumers to try, so generating trial was our objective. And finally unit dose, behind our strong Triple Chamber innovation, our unit dose consumption has grown two times the category rate for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our total unit dose share now including OXICLEAN is at 4.2%. In litter, the clumping litter category grew 3.4% and ARM & HAMMER consumption grew 6%. So we gained share. Our new litter innovation SLIDE has already reached a 4% share of the clumping litter segment and we grew share 60 basis points in the quarter. Of the 13 new launches in the litter category over the past six years, SLIDE ranks number one in repeats after six months in the marketplace. So we feel good about the future of that product. The dry shampoo category grew 33% in Q2. The dry shampoo category is now $130 million in the U.S. BATISTE grew 9.6% to a 31% share. BATISTE has the strongest brand loyalty of any dry shampoo in the category, including brands with significant hair care heritage, with nearly 75% of BATISTE users using the brand most often versus the competition. Now turning to gummies. The gummy category grew 13% but our vitamin business was flat for the quarter. VITAFUSION, which is our adult gummy business is contending with significant competitive discounting, so there is lots of BOGOs going on in gummy vitamins, we haven't been engaging in that, so that's been hurting our business. The condom category declined in consumption by 3% in the quarter. TROJAN Condom share in measured channels was down 150 basis points. Although some of that is offset by online consumption, condom consumption all channels has been soft for the last few quarters. Our research suggests that young people are having less sex, some of the factors are demographics, young people living at home longer, and surprisingly the distraction of mobile phone usage. So, innovation is always a catalyst to category growth. Our new XOXO condom, which is geared toward women is going extremely well. We're focusing XOXO and our TROJAN advertising on digital to try to get the young people to spend less time on their phones and more time using TROJAN condoms. On the acquisition front, we recently announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Water Pik located in Fort Collins, Colorado. It's another great business. They're the market leader in Water Jet technology in both oral water flossers and showerheads. Water Pik will be our 11th power brand, and this transaction which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions is expected to close in the third quarter. Next up is Rick to give you some details on Q2 results and the outlook for the rest of the year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Matt and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 per share compared to $0.43 in 2016, down 4.7% after excluding a $0.12 per share charge related to the previously announced UK pension settlement. The $0.41 was better than our $0.37 outlook, largely due to our better margins in international and SPD business, some help from tax, slightly higher sales and lower SG&A spending. Reported revenues were up 2.3% to $898 million, organic sales were 1.8%, at the high end of our 1% to 2% range. Organic sales growth was driven by our international consumer business, and our SPD division. Now, let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales were flat as couponing and promotional investments impacted net sales growth. Growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergents, OXICLEAN laundry detergent and stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was offset by declines in XTRA laundry detergent, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kits and TROJAN condoms. We expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2% for the Consumer Domestic business. International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by FEMFRESH and BATISTE in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, STERIMAR, OXICLEAN stain-fighter in Mexico and BATISTE, VMS and FEMFRESH in Australia. So, just broad based growth across the globe. We now expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 7% for the international business. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 9.4%, due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business. Milk prices and U.S. dairy farm profitability remain at a higher level than a year ago. We are raising our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 2% to 3% to up approximately 6%. Turning now to gross margin. Our adjusted second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, an 80-basis point decrease from a year ago. This was a bit better than we'd originally expected, largely due to continued productivity improvements and better margin on the international and SPD side. The Q2 gross margin decline breaks out as follows. We had higher promotional levels in Q2, which resulted in a drag of 180 basis points, gross margin improvement of 70 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures, and productivity net of commodities was worth about 30 basis points of improvement. Moving now to marketing. Marketing as a percent of revenue hit a recent high of 14.6%. Remember, at the beginning of the year, we said that we were beefing up Q2 marketing. Historically, big quarters were Q2 and Q4, this year Q2 and Q3 to better support innovation. SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.4%, a 460-basis point increase primarily due to the UK pension settlement. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 13% – was 13% of sales up 20 basis points, primarily due to increased amortization from acquisitions. Now to operating profit. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.1%, which was 190 basis points lower than the prior year, largely due to the marketing shift and higher promotional spending. Other expense was $6.4 million, primarily driven by $9.5 million of interest. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% on an adjusted basis. Turning to cash, we generated approximately $250 million of net cash for the first half, a $47 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital, which was a function of a $30 million increase in deferred incentive comp plus higher inventories. This was partially offset by higher cash earnings. So, in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include strong share growth driven by our investments in our domestic business, continued strong growth in international and a return to growth in our Specialty Products segment. Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 organic sales growth of 3.5% which reflects the consumer domestic business growing at approximately 3%. Just a remainder 2016 growth was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, therefore the second half of 2017 will benefit from easier comps. On a two-year stack basis, the first and second half are consistent at around 5%. Gross margin is expected to contract in Q3 with increased levels of promotion and coupon investments. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be significantly higher year-over-year, with the shift from Q4 to Q3 to continue our innovation support. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.46, compared to $0.47 a year ago, or a 2% decrease year-over-year, which includes $0.02 of dilution from the Water Pik acquisition. The primary drivers of the decrease are higher marketing in support of our new product launches and higher consumer promotional spending. As we end the year, we expect strong earnings growth in Q4, as heavy coupons around new product trial peels off, and the marketing goes back to normal levels. And now, turning to the full year, and as I go through these metrics please keep in mind that we are excluding any impact from Water Pik. We're maintaining our expectations for organic sales growth of 3%, we maintain our gross margin improvement guidance of 40 bps improvement year-over-year. Our full-year marketing expectations is approximately 12% of sales consistent with prior years. Operating margin expansion of 30 basis points improvement, when adjusted for the pension and Brazilian charges. Other expense is expected to be around $31 million, primarily driven by interest expense, which does not include any interest expense from the Water Pik acquisition. And the tax rate is expected to be around 33%. On a reported basis, we continue to expect EPS to be $1.79, which includes the $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and a $0.12 negative impact from the pension settlement and no impact from the Water Pik acquisition. Excluding those items, we expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth or $1.92 per share. And as mentioned previously for the full-year, we expect no net impact from the Water Pik acquisition. To wrap up, we expect approximately $605 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $45 million of CapEx for the full year. This represents an excess of 120% free cash flow conversion. We also have some good news on the pension settlement front. We were able to beat our original expectations of settlement costs and we have no further pension risk or volatility to worry about as a company. So now Matt and I will open it up for questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Dara.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, two questions. First, I was just hoping we could discuss the promotional levels in the quarter a bit more. The domestic consumer business obviously price mix is down significantly by 6%. It seems like it's kind of a unprecedented level of promotional spending. So I just wanted to understand better the decision making behind that large a magnitude of higher spend or lower price and how much of that continues or lingers going forward? And has something changed here longer-term in terms of the competitive spending levels that's necessary or sort of the cost of doing business in the industry? Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. I wouldn't look at that as a sea change at all Dara. I think, if you looked at historical numbers, you would see for us that we were actually on more on the sidelines when it came to the amount that we promoted on products, particularly in laundry. So, but we had two new innovations this past quarter, the Triple Chamber and also the OXICLEAN restage. So, we wanted to get behind those in a significant way, which is what we did in order to promote trial. And in my remarks, I said we had very high promotional effectiveness and what that means is that you're able to steal share from other brands to your brand as a result of your promotion. So, that's a good measure of whether or not they're effective, but you can't keep that up forever. You do that to promote trial, and the expectation is that you're going to get repurchase in the second half. So, it's – I wouldn't view it as a sea change.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that Dara is, of the 600-basis point drag on a price mix perspective, about a third of that was to drive new products and trial. So, again it's not going to repeat forever.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And it seems like you're pretty happy from a market share standpoint, yet sort of the overall level of growth and top-line growth in the consumer domestic business is pretty muted versus history for you guys. So, it implies that category environment is much more difficult in terms of growth we're seeing in the U.S. industry. Just was hoping for your perspective on that, is that just the competitive environment, or do you think there are broader issues with fragmenting consumer demand and perhaps the younger generation having different priorities as you touched on earlier in the condom business. So, just any perspective on what's been driving this slowdown in U.S. category growth and if you think it's more temporary or longer term in nature would be helpful?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'll let Matt talk about a macro perspective but for us it's also some of the comps Dara. In the first half of 2016 we as a company grew 4%. And so, in the first half of this year, it's around 2%. So it's the inverse of that in the second half, we grew at about around 2% in 2016, and 4% is our expectation in 2017. So a couple of our big categories like vitamin and laundry, that's what the comps are for the prior year.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. From a macro standpoint, you may remember at the beginning of the year, we said that our expectation was that categories would grow 1.5% to 2%. So what we do is we take a look at all of our categories weighted, and so our categories weighted, it would be around 1.5% growth in the second quarter. So it's on the lower end of that, Dara, I'd say that there are certain personal care categories in particular that are somewhat depressed. So if you look at categories like the depilatories, oral analgesics, condoms, kits, battery-operated toothbrushes, all of those categories, those categories were down in Q2, year-over-year. So and again there's discounting across all categories. So that's one of the contributing factors to that.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And is that something you think lingers more longer term as you look out to 2018 more temporary, just general thoughts on that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, I think these things can be lumpy. I'd say that the condom thing has been more lingering, as my remarks were in the last few quarters, it seems like people are having less sex. And there's less condom usage, we've done some work around that, that could be with us going forward. But I wouldn't be alarmed about the other personal care categories just yet.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: So question on the guidance. Just wanted to make sure I was clear in terms of how the year is progressing here. So it seems like international momentum continues. That's now expected to be a little bit better. Specialty looks like it's going to be considerably better and consumer domestic a bit worse. And then to bring this back to the EPS guidance, it looks like on an FX neutral basis that comes down by about a point. So Matt, is that just around – is it higher investment levels than you anticipated? I think, category growth maybe slowed half a point, maybe a function of mix with personal care probably not coming in quite where you expected year-to-date and that being a higher margin than the household side. So just – can you maybe quantify a bit that point that came down on the FX neutral guide?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'll take that, Kevin. It's a couple of things, really. You're right. Domestic, we brought down slightly. Personal care in the front half was negative in the quarter especially, but we believe that's going to turnaround because of the comps and other category growth in the back half. So we feel good about that. To the degree that we get any benefits from FX, remember we're typically spending that back. So to be blunt, our marketing line will probably go up slightly versus our previous expectations. We're not changing anything. So we just reinvest that if we need to. So I guess, that's a short answer.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's kind of what I had figured. Just one follow-up from me and then I'll pass it on. Just getting back to the promotional intensity in laundry, and it seems like Procter ramped its level of trade spend pretty significantly through mid July. Matt, would you care to comment on what you saw in the back half of July? Did you see that level continue? You guys obviously ramped pretty considerably. What's sort of the expectation with respect to laundry here for the balance of the year and do you have enough in the guidance to sort of combat any level, should it remain this elevated? Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Kevin, I'll take the first part maybe. P&G and everybody always continues to, it's a promotional category, laundry is always a promotional category. But in the long term, if you take a step back, what's happening at the end of the day, the premium tier usually wins with innovation and the value tier wins because of value and the mid-tier shrinks. I would say that's no different than what's been happening for the last 52 weeks, 26 weeks and 13 weeks. And so, if they promote a little bit more, that's usually the higher end.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, to answer your question, Kevin. As far as July goes yeah. I mean if you talk to Lou and our sales guys, you'll see that things have heated up with some of the other brands, but we always expect the worst. So, I would say that that's in our guidance, we always expect it's going to be tougher in the second half, especially after we took things up in the Q2.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, thanks. Just to, I guess press on that a little bit. The laundry couponing obviously you just said it was targeted at new products. But we also saw significant activity around the core ARM & HAMMER brand. In the whole category it looks like volumes accelerated led by your brands. And I guess out of that a few questions. So just – I just want a little bit more color on why be so aggressive, so broadly aggressive at a time when everyone's kind of on pins and needles with respect to this category in particular with the Henkel change and what P&G is doing and it just – it feels like the risk of provoking a continued cycle of retaliation is especially high, so just some color there? And then your confidence that the trial you've generated will translate to repeat once the couponing subsides? And lastly, just your sense of the pantry inventory you may have created, just because again it feels like the volumes sold this past quarter likely outpaced consumption by a fair degree?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, okay. So, I've got three questions here. I'll take the first one. Really, it's all relative to your perspective, Steve. I mean for us, we aren't outspending the competition, and I'll give you a couple of facts. For the quarter, our amount sold on deal for laundry detergent was 36%. On average the category was 35%. For couponing, this is more of a limited measurement, but our data says we're around 30% and the category is around 27%, 28%. So, maybe we're a basis point two or higher. For a long time, we've kind of held back, but I think we are not making the situation worse, we're just getting up to par with our competition.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, and the other question Steve. So, we have unit dose and we have OXICLEAN restage. So, I mentioned, our promotional effectiveness is an important measure as to whether or not your efforts are working. So, we expect that we're going to – it's a little early to tell now, but we do expect that we're going to get some repeat purchases in the second half for OXICLEAN laundry detergent. And remember on unit dose, which is the Triple Chamber, we are the only value detergent, only value unit dose that's out there. So, we have an advantage, so to the extent that we get people to trial the unit dose our research tells us that people, it will stick. And if you noticed that our unit dose share grew 40 basis points in the quarter and we've been growing twice as fast as the category, the unit dose category for the past five quarters. So, we've juiced that a little bit. And so we want to accelerate the stealing consumers and bringing them over to our ARM & HAMMER unit dose, particularly the Triple Chamber.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Fair enough, fair enough. And I if I could just squeeze in one question unrelated just on the new subsidiary in Germany, just some color there. It's obviously a large market, but it's also historically been pretty tough at least a tough one in which to make some money. So, just your approach to targeting Germany?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well. Look the – we have a subsidiary in the UK and one in France. So we have – and then and that's it in Europe. And all the other countries we served through distributors historically. Germany was unique in our minds because it is the largest economy in Europe and strongest economy in Europe in a well. And so we felt that's a place that we should be. So, that was the logic behind it. And obviously, we do have sales into Germany today through distributors, so, we have a base of sales in Germany. So, we are not going in with a donut. But we do think that that our brands are going to resonate there, and we're going to be able to generate some sales growth there.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey Lauren.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. First of all, could you talk a little bit – you mentioned specific of the e-commerce growth in the release, but talk a little bit about e-commerce what you're kind of doing proactively strategically to do that. Primary retailers where you're sourcing that growth, and then also same kind of conversation around club and the performance there?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We're working with all of our retailers on their dot com sales. So we have – we took somebody, one of our more senior people in the company and dedicated her to working with all of our retailers to drive their online sales. And obviously, we have a structure behind her as well. Amazon is the big dog, I'm sure that's true for virtually every CPG company. So we continue to grow with them, but Wal-Mart you probably know this more recently started in-store pickup or experimenting with in-store pickup, online ordering and in-store pickup on the East Coast. So it's kind of a wait and see to see how that's going. They're naturally integrating Wal-Mart and Jet.com right now. So we'll be working closely with them, but all the retailers have an interest in getting our products online on their dot coms. So we've been working with them to set up the pages.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I know, Rick you shared that, you said about a third of that 6% price promotion drag on consumer domestic was related to trial and couponing if I heard you correctly. But that's still – I mean 400 basis points is still a big number, right. And it does sound like, I mean last quarter, you were very clear around the promotional environment, you gave a little tweak to the outlook for Q2 and in general to account for that. But it does feel like something picked up intra-quarter on that front. So can you just talk – just address that. I mean, was it reactionary? Was it pressure from you? We know that there is incredible price pressure among – competition between and among retailers. But it does feel like it's worse. If you can talk a little – address that and why that – anything I've said is incorrect?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's probably two things, one is just mix. As Matt said, some of the personal care items are down. So it just looks like the negative drag on price mix because some of our household businesses have higher trade rates. So I think that's part of it. I think and the other part, it's probably some of these trial activities are very enticing for the consumer. And so, when that happens, the volume goes up, but also price – the negative price mix goes up right along with it. So, that's kind of what happened I think in both cases.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, just switching to cat litter, I mean certainly fine performance of – good performance in the first half. I guess one is, is cat litter a growth category, I mean I don't currently own a cat, but I know plenty of people do, but I mean the whole category is growing 3.5% its outperforming most CPG categories out there. So, I mean is that something that's sustainable, is everybody kind of playing well in the – I'm not going to go there, playing well in the sandbox. Or do you think you should see more competitive pressure there as we look to the back half?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. In fact, if you go back, Bill and look at the last few years of 2014, 2015, and 2016, the clumping cat litter category actually grew faster than 3.4%. So, that has been a perennial grower for a number of years. So, we don't expect that to change. Pets are the new, they're like children. People are happy to invest in them and innovation and price has driven a lot of that growth over time.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But you're not seeing Nestle or Clorox get, trying to win, I mean last year it was much more competitive. It seems like it's eased per se this year?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. No. In fact, the amount sold on deal was 21%, it was 22% in the first quarter. So, it's pretty level.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then on the vitamins side, this is the first time I've really – I think, really heard you say that there has been more discounting more BOGOs. I mean it's been more of the category has had its ups and downs, but now it sounds like everybody is jumping into the gummy side. Is that something that you just kind of step back and let it play out, or I mean is there anything you can do to really push your brands and kind of differentiate yourself? I mean how should I look at that especially as we move into not only the back half of the year, but into 2018?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So we've been on the side lines with respect to the buy one, get ones. So what, our focus is on the brand equity. So it is a sea of brands, there are 30 gummy vitamin brands with all the gummy vitamin brands. So the game really long-term is they're not all sustainable. And so over time what will happen is the retailers will pull those back. So the long game is to win with the brand equities that connect with consumers. So you'll be seeing us being very focused on differentiating our brand versus the other brands. And of course I won't tell you how we're going to do that.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And just a quick – I thought you were rolling out a lot of new, a lot more SKUs there. Did that have the impact on growth that you were expecting or is it, the overall category slow down is offsetting that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, no, no. The gummy category is growing. So we're going sideways because we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs and competitors have been doing the BOGOs and we have not. I mean it's as simple as that.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: The new products are doing well. So we have Simply Good, this is one of our new products we've got an energy gummy vitamin, but that's not enough to offset the BOGOs. So we've lost some sales to other brands.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: But it's not something you want – you don't want to follow that one down the hole. You got to take the long view on it.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I understand. Thanks so much.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, first question just want to go back to your outlook for category growth for this year, I guess early in the year was plus 2%, and first half you mentioned it's been plus 1.5%. That 50 basis points delta, that's all price or is there any volume slow down that you're seeing in some of those categories in the U.S.?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, look, I'd say it's both, I wouldn't say it's all one or the other. I mentioned there were five categories that were in personal care that are down between 2% and 5% in the second quarter. And I don't have any stats for you for the full year, but that is one of the drags that we're dealing with there.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So, it's a little bit of both. In terms of the gross margin outlook, you're sticking with plus 40 bps this year, that's what you've done in the first half, but it looks like second quarter obviously well below that. How much confidence do you have that the improving mix and things like that will help you in the second half, and how much are you counting on and easing of the promotion environment to help drive that second half?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think we're very confident in the gross margin outlook, Joe, I mean part of it is like I said before the comps right for example in the first half our vitamin business was up 5% in 2016. And our second half was flat, right. And so we did a lot to win back the consumer in the first half of 2016, and that's what we're comping over this year. So, we expect to have some good tailwinds on the personal care side in the back half, and we also have some good productivity projects in the pipeline. So, we feel really good about our Q4 number and our full year number for gross margin.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just one last one, the timing of the closure of Water Pik, any guess as to late in the quarter?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: It'll probably be sometime in this month.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for sliding me in. I suppose I want to take up on the gross margin line of questioning. Certainly, some of the algorithm for ongoing evergreen gross margin expansion for you guys has been predicated on healthy business mix shifts. What I'm hearing you describe today is a more challenging environment for the personal care sleeve of your portfolio, condoms lower, pregnancy test kits lower, vitamin category fragmented becoming more competitive, and obviously it's kind of played out in results with personal care lagging. Meanwhile, the household side really, really aggressive. How do we think about the enablers of margin on a go-forward and also while we're at it maybe you can give us a few of the puts and takes that contribute to margin this quarter?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, sure. I'll start with that one and then go into the, kind of the outlook again, but in my script I said we had a drag of about 180 basis points on promotional spending, with negative price mix, mainly negative price. We had a 30 basis point drag from commodities, plus 60 basis point on productivity and then we had around 80 basis points of help from acquisitions and divestitures to get to the minus 80 basis points for the quarter. And so we're essentially flat to slightly up for the first half. I think as you look at the second half, there's a few things going on. Number one, some of that new product trial, the deep couponing kind of that peels off as you get the repeat purchases without all the promotional activity. So, that's a good thing for gross margin. I think our productivity pipeline continues to improve. Commodities, the drag gets a little less in the second half as we start to lap some of the negativity we had in the back half of 2016. I think, the personal care question you raise is a fair one, but I think more than anything, it's more of a comp analysis. Again, a good example of that is just this, the VMS business was very promotional in the first half of 2016 as well because we were winning back the consumer because we were out of stock in 2015. And so we don't have that level of promotion. Is the category maybe a little bit more promotional, yes. But, year-over-year it still won't comp that. So, hopefully that helps.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason, if you want to take the long view. So, in a lot of these personal care categories we are the number one brand. So, you wouldn't be privy to what launches we have prepared for 2018 or 2019. But innovation is always going to be the winner here. And also with respect to margin, the other thing that expands it for us is our Good to Great program which is a continuous improvement and the other kicker is always acquisitions that we take on that have higher than corporate gross margin. So, that's why we felt good about calling next year for 3% organic top line growth and 9% EPS growth.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful guys. And one more then I'll pass it on. I want to build off of Lauren's line of questioning, but from a slightly different angle. She probed on e-com, you guys clearly have a lot of great momentum and are investing behind it. There has been a tremendous amount of consternation. It's been primarily anchored on the food side of staples these days about retailer retaliation, trying to sharpen price points, kind of suck some of the oxygen out of the air as discounters move in and as encroachment from Amazon builds. Lots of pressure for price concessions and clear evidence of using private label as a lever. Stepping into the HBC world, where these categories are further afield online and arguably have more potential going forward. It would seem like your categories are equally susceptible to sort of the retailer pressure. So my question is just that, are you seeing it? Are you seeing evidence of retailers trying to push to get those price points sharper to help fend off some of the channel shifts that may be beginning to build moment?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Is your question specifically about our bricks-and-mortar retailers squeezing CPGs more than in the past because of online pressure?
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. That's a nice distinct summary of it, yes.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Well look, the retailers, this is not a new phenomenon, this has been going on for several years now. So every year the retailers are aggressive with respect to our price concessions and this year is no different. I think whenever you're negotiating with a retailer you certainly want it to be a win-win and that's how we approach it. So if in fact, there are some things they want us to do, there's something they'll do for us in return with respect to shelving, or endcaps, et cetera, so. And we've been able to perform really well under these circumstances and we don't view that as we're going to be any more susceptible than any other company. In fact, we think we may be handling it better than others.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Is it fair to assume that your guidance for the balance of the year, you're assuming the $0.02 drag from Water Pik in 3Q, but it would reverse again in the fourth quarter because you had said before that it would be flat or neutral for fiscal year 2017 – I am sorry for fiscal year, yeah so for this fiscal year 2017 just to make sure that I have the right number here? And then related to that, so then if I take the $0.53 of the fourth quarter, you would still take that, those $0.02 accretion, then you'd imply as to meeting (41:54) rebounding year-on-year on EPS. So, I was wondering, if you can help us bridge that. So, as you're talking before and if I understood it correctly. The 4 percentage points drag in pricing, you said obviously and that's your couponing, that is still kind of a category drag. You're assuming the category drag goes away in the fourth quarter or in other words perhaps people are just going to use their stocks or destocking and then you're going to have a pickup in repurchases after they've tried your product, is that the way we should think about it?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, Andrea. So, there is a couple of questions in there. The first is on Water Pik, you're exactly right. It's flat for the full year. We have a $0.02 drag in Q3, largely because of the transactional and transitional expenses and not a full quarter worth of earnings. And then a plus $0.02 for the fourth quarter and flat for the year. Your second question, so that implies with our Q3 outlook, that implies a 20% growth rate in earnings in Q4. You're exactly right, that's really two things, 20% is around $0.09 and that's really two things. One is that half of it is the shift of marketing that we've been talking about all year long, right we said we're going to move a lot of our Q4 spending into Q2 and Q3 to better line up with our new product launches. That's about half of it. The other half is, as we've mentioned before we have a better organic growth rate in the back half of the year, so and some gross margin improvement. So, those are the two things driving 20% growth. And then the third question you had was a 400 basis point drag in couponing. Now remember a year ago – that's not just couponing by itself, it's also couponing trade spends and plotting and what not. So, it's a little lumpy in 2016 compared to 2017. I'd tell you that we have some promotional spending throughout the balance of the year, but it's not like we're pulling everything back and we hope we're going to continue to do great without spending. Like we said before, we're hitting our levels right at our competition.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Rick, just what I meant the 400 basis points is that out of the 600 basis points that you had as a drag in price mix, 200 bps was related couponing and then the balance would be industry trends or as you guys were mentioning five categories being very negative. So, I was just wondering if you're assuming that the industry embedded in your guidance that the industry stabilize in the fourth quarter, because I understand the couponing that you had in the fourth quarter or the second half of last year was very mild, it was like 35 bps drag. So, I was wondering if, 50 bps drag – I'm sorry. So I'm wondering if it's mostly related to the industry, that you believe it will stabilize or it's probably that right, so if you...
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Right. I understand. The biggest driver is actually mix right. We've said in the first half of the year, part of that 400 basis points drag is personal care, right. And so we expect personal care to be better in the second half right. My answer to Lauren was part of the reason we have a negative price mix, when you look at organic growth is because we have more household increase and then personal care declining. And so just as that naturally balances back out that will improve the negative drag on the price mix line too.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's fair. Thank you so much, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. First, I just want to follow up on an earlier question around pantry inventory. Given all the couponing and the promotion. Do you think that you're just pulling forward demand like has it – in your view, has there been pantry stocking on the part of consumers, because of all the promotional activity. And then as commodity prices continue to move, how do you think that – will that impact levels of competitive promotion going forward?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well pantry loading is always a matter of a conjecture, right. We cannot – if you look at the amount of promotion in the quarter, as we said before, it's 36%. The fact that we – it shifted from other retailer stocks. Remember, we were the only manufacturer that grew share in the quarter. So everybody lost share to us, I wouldn't say that there's pantry loading broadly as a result.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And the laundry category is only up around 1% or 1.5%. So it's not like the consumption was sky high.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then just in terms of like the track versus untracked growth, it seems to be moving around quite a bit. I mean, last quarter you were well ahead of track. This quarter it went the opposite way. I mean is this just a function of lapping some of the recent gains you've had in the untracked channels and now you're sort of lapping that or has your thoughts on promotion in channels shifted in some way?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, Olivia, we still have growth in untracked channels, we're not lapping any big gains or anything like that. We still have growth, it's just the biggest driver is between the Nielsen data and even when you add in the untracked stuff is the negative drag from couponing. And there is a little bit of retailer inventory shifts but the primary driver is the gross to net couponing stuff.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, there has been a lot of questions on your promotional spending in the quarter. But I guess – I just wanted to circle back on something. I was hoping you guys could compare the magnitude of your incremental couponing and promotional investments in your tracked maybe versus non-tracked channels. I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how much you're driving growth in non-tracked or maybe online, via promos or is that just, that growth really just coming from the long-term structural shifts we've been seeing out of the brick and mortar channels?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's a simple answer, it's primarily bricks and mortar. So, it's just – don't think of it as – that it's online promotions.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then another question on BATISTE, it continues to have great momentum. So, I guess I'm wondering what you guys think the real opportunity is for this brand. And then what the opportunities are to leverage the brand further into other adjacent categories. And essentially how quickly could you guys execute on this, I mean. And then finally I guess I'm curious, if you think there is any risk that your momentum in dry shampoo could fade over time due to some of the momentum from the hair care, heritage brands, as the category grows in the U.S.?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Actually, the simple way to think about the opportunity for dry shampoo for us is – this originated in the UK and in the UK the value of the category is $60 million, and they have a little over 60 million people in the UK. In the U.S., with 335 million people, the category size is only $130 million right now. Now it's growing rapidly, I think it grew 30% in the second quarter. So, it's growing like a rocket but ship but it has a long it with ago. The category size could double over the next few years. And we would enjoy a tremendous amount of growth as a result of that, because we have the number one share and we're in the low-30%'s.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then what about the opportunity to further leverage the brand? What are your thoughts there?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. That's always an opportunity to go in adjacencies, because the BATISTE brand is so strong, particularly with young users, but we wouldn't telegraph what we might be thinking about doing there.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Is that it?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. I guess we're done. Thanks for joining us today. And we'll talk to you at end of the third quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, Church & Dwight's financial objectives and forecasts. Church & Dwight will be discussing the results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. The company believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of their business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating their business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. See the Appendix in this morning's earnings release for a reconciliation. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is finished, we'll open the call up for questions. So Q1 was a strong quarter for our company. There's lots of good news. Organic sales growth of 2.3%, exceeded our outlook of approximately 1% to 2% and we also exceeded our EPS outlook. Our global consumer business delivered organic sales growth of 2.6%, led by continued strong growth by our international consumer business. In the U.S., organic sales grew approximately 1%, meeting our expectations and comping a big first quarter in Q1 2016 of 5%, and six of 10 power brands grew share in the quarter. So, a good report card there. Our international consumer business exceeded our expectations with 11.8% organic growth. International has emerged as a growth driver for us over the past few years. The investments that we have made in new leadership, regional hubs and brand focus, have been paying off. Our international business grew 8% in 2015, 10% in 2016 and we expect 6% to 7% growth in 2017. In Q1, many regions contributed to the success story. Turning to Specialty Products, our Specialty Products Division saw a continued improvement. The flattish organic growth was actually better than expected. The dairy economy continues to recover from the weakness that we saw in 2016, and we have easier comps going forward. So, now back to the U.S., categories slowed down a bit in the U.S. in Q1, particularly January and February, but we have seen signs of improvement in March and April. Innovation is always a good stimulant for category growth and we have excellent innovation on the way. Many of our new products are hitting store shelves now and we attempt to get behind them in the coming quarters. We've leveled the playing field in unit dose laundry detergent with the launch of our own Triple Chamber detergent product. In Q1, before the launch of Triple Chamber, ARM & HAMMER nearly doubled the category growth rate for unit dose for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Triple Chamber product is hitting shelves now and we expect future share gains as a result. And liquid detergent, which still accounts for almost three quarters of the category, ARM & HAMMER detergent grew share for the 29th consecutive quarter. Also, in laundry, we are restaging our OXICLEAN laundry detergent in Q2 with new packaging, a new formula and new advertising. Turning to cat litter, our launch of ARM & HAMMER SLIDE cat litter is off to a great start. Consumers have responded to this innovative new litter that does not stick to the litter box. This benefit addresses a major frustration for cat odors adding much needed convenience to the clean-up process. SLIDE has already reached a 4-share of the clumping litter segment and we expect to gain share as we move through the year. In adult gummy vitamins, VITAFUSION is launching an energy vitamin made with caffeine to address consumers' desire for mental energy and alertness. Over to condoms, TROJAN has launched a new XOXO premium quality condom targeting both men and women with a soft touch, aloe lubricated latex in a unique portable carrying case. TROJAN will be advertised for the first time on network television this year. Many of you will see our commercials in series finales this spring. In fact, we will be airing on Saturday Night Live this Saturday night, May 6. Dry shampoo. Dry shampoo consumption grew 32% in Q1 and is now $120 million category in the U.S. Our BATISTE brand launched new variants to continue to broaden the line. Our new lightly scented Bare is getting strong reviews from women and BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo in the world. Just a few more things. As you read in the release, we plan to put significant muscle behind these innovations in the next couple of quarters, both in store and on-the-air. Remember that six out of our 10 power brands grew share in Q1, and we're aiming to improve on that mark in the coming quarters. On the acquisition front, we continue to build the capabilities of our animal productivity business. This week, we closed the acquisition of Agro BioSciences. This is a terrific business that adds products and a lot of scientific talent to our team, and we are really excited about the Wisconsin team, that's joining us. Agro BioSciences expands our ability to provide non-antibiotic solutions to promote the health and productivity of production animals. And this is in a world that will grow population from 7 billion today to 9 billion by the middle of the century. And we expect this business to grow very rapidly in the coming years. Finally, we streamlined the company a bit in Q1 with the sale of our Brazilian chemical business. We will continue to concentrate on growing our existing consumer business in Brazil. Next up is Rick to give you details of our first quarter results and Q2 and full-year outlook.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I will start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.52 per share compared to $0.43 in 2016, up 20.9%. The $0.52 was better than our $0.46 outlook, largely due to organic revenue and gross margin expansion as well as $0.03 from tax. Adjusted EPS excludes a $0.01 per share charge related to the sale of the Brazilian Specialty Products business and includes a $0.03 per share positive impact from adopting a new stock option accounting standard. We did change our methodology here, which is consistent with the rest of our peer group. Reported revenues were up 3.3% to $877 million. Organic sales grew 2.3%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 1% to 2%. The organic sales beat was driven by our international consumer business. Now, let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increased by 0.8%, primarily due to ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, BATISTE dry shampoo, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter. We continue to expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2.5% for the Consumer Domestic business. International organic growth was up an impressive 11.8%, driven largely by OXICLEAN, FEMFRESH and BATISTE in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and litter in Canada. As Matt said, investments we've made continue to drive that business forward. For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were essentially flat due to lower volumes in the specialty chemical sector of the business. The animal productivity business improved in both price and volume on higher demand from the U.S. dairy industry, as milk prices and dairy farm profitability improved. Turning now to gross margin. Our adjusted first quarter gross margin was 45.7%, a 110 basis point increase from year ago. Q1 benefited from two factors primarily, productivity programs and the higher margin from acquired businesses. These were partially offset by higher raw material cost and a slight drag from price mix. Moving now to marketing. Marketing as a percent of revenue was 10.3%, which was down slightly year-over-year, but remember, we are shifting some spend out of Q1 and Q4 into Q2 and Q3. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.6%, flat from the prior year. And now to operating profit. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, which was 170 basis points higher than the prior year. Other income and expense was $5.9 million, which was a drag and largely due to $8 million of expense from interest. Next, the income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 30.3% on an adjusted basis. And now to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. We generated $139.6 million of net cash for the quarter, $30 million decrease from the same quarter a year ago, largely due to working capital and some retiree deferred comp and higher incentive comp payout. So, in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 2.3% organic, 20.9% EPS growth which translates into a reported EPS growth of 18.6%. Now, turning to second quarter outlook. We expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. Consumer domestic growth looks similar to Q1, and international SPD growth (10:01) to 1% to 2% of the company. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be significantly higher year over year and gross margin to contract in Q2, as we increase support behind our new products. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.37 compared to $0.43 a year ago, or a 14% decrease year over year. Primary drivers, again, are the higher marketing in support of our new products and the higher consumer promotional spend. And now turning to the full year. To summarize our thinking, we're maintaining our expectations for organic sales of 3%. In February, we called approximately 60 basis points of gross margin expansion and given the incremental promotion, we're now calling 40 basis points. Our full-year marketing expectation is approximately 12% of sales, consistent with 2016 and prior years. Moving to SG&A. Our original expectations were a 10 basis point increase. We now expect that to be about 20 basis points, largely due to the incremental amortization from our small deals. We expect operating margin expansion to be flat when adjusted for the pension and Brazilian charges. And then finally for the income tax line, the full-year rate forecast will be 33.5%, which includes the effect of the new stock option accounting standard in our outlook. On a reported basis, we now expect EPS to be $1.75 to $1.77 per share, which includes a $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and a $0.14 to $0.16 negative impact from the pension settlement. Excluding these items, we now expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth of $1.92 per share. And finally, turning to free cash flow. We continue to expect $600 million, net of approximately $50 million of CapEx for the full year of 2017. This represents an industry-leading 124% free cash flow conversion. And with that, we'll turn it back over to you, Sumat, and I can answer any questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question goes to the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Your line is open.
Megan Cody - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. This is actually Megan Cody on for Steve Powers. I was wondering, could you guys break down your international growth trend a little bit further and talk about the sustainability of those rates?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. So we posted 11% organic growth in Q1, and more than half – let's say two-thirds of that is non-export. Too often we focus on the export part of the business. But, let's say a third of it is export and two-thirds of it is the rest of the world. You know we're making a lot of investments there over the past couple years, so we think the export growth will continue for us. If your question is around the full year, so we're calling 6% to 7% for the full year – or we posted almost the 12% for Q1. So we don't expect that the 12% to continue throughout the year. To break it down, we mentioned in the release that Canada had a big quarter, but it does vary from quarter to quarter, somewhat lumpy as to which businesses or which regions might drive it. I think the best way to think about it is that we do think that we're taking our number up on the full year. I think we started the year with 4% to 5% for international to grow and now we're calling 6% to 7%.
Megan Cody - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
Operator: If your line's on mute, please unmute your phone.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hello, Bill?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: It's okay, just move on to the next call.
Operator: All right. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Hey, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Matt, curious to kind of get some thoughts from you on how you're seeing the U.S. environment. You sounded pretty good, I guess, on sort of what you're seeing in March and April, and we're seeing that in Nielsen data as well. But of course, a lot of the sort of cautionary commentary that we're hearing, I'm sure is not lost on you guys at all. So a couple of questions with that, just kind of how you're seeing, Matt, things with the retail environment and the state of the consumer. And then, the second part of the question with respect to your outlook for the year and what seems to be baked in, using sort of back-of-the-napkin math, because you guys broke out that 110 basis point contribution from non-tracked channels. It would seem like the tracked channel growth in the quarter in terms of your shipments matched pretty well I think with what we're seeing in the Nielsen data. And probably to get to the 3% core sales or organic sales for the year, you're baking in some of this improvement that we're seeing. So I just wanted to know if that was sort of accurate math roughly and sort of fair characterization of your outlook.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. So I'll give you some color around the macros, and I'll let Rick address the reconciliation from the, say, measured channels and what we post for organic versus what you've seen. So as far as macros go, yeah, so the categories certainly January, February are somewhat slow, picked up March and April. We started the year thinking that our full year was based on a 2% category growth rate. We didn't see that in Q1 as we're little closer to 1.5% for the categories that we play in. We still feel good that we can get there, and we saw GDP just everybody else, 70 basis points, so that's a bit of a head scratch. We got to wait for the jobs report on Friday. But as far as the trends go, there's a lot of discounting that took place in the first quarter. We saw laundry was down 50 basis points, but remember, year-over-year, laundry was up 6% last year as a category. So, it's like a huge comp for laundry, but there is well a lot of discounting in the first quarter. You heard a couple of retailers cite the impact of late tax returns of anybody who claims here in income credit, you can't get your refund until after Feb 15. Then, of course, there's uncertainty always affects consumer behavior. So, you have – because we have a new administration, there's uncertainty around health care and taxes. And then somebody wrote a piece on Hispanic purchasing bloc and that's down year-over-year. So, it's empirical data that supports that, why, because of worries about immigration policy and deportation. And then, you have the shift to online, and obviously, that's – you won't see that in measured channels. But, yeah, certainly, there was a slowdown for the first couple of months. I see March and April picking up. I don't think other than what I cited, I don't think there's a lot more that we would point to as far as to why it's slowed down, but things certainly look better in April. So, we're not expecting a repeat of that for the remainder of the year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Then, in terms of shipping to consumption. For Q1, our math says for the quarter that we're maybe down 70 basis points or organic growth was 0.8% for example and domestically, that's 150 basis points, and we said about 110 basis points of that 150 basis points was largely due to untracked channels. We think that trend will continue. I think you're going to see that across our space. For us, from an organic perspective for the full year, we had 2.3% in Q1, we're calling 1% to 2% in Q2 and then Q3 and Q4, that would require high-3s type of numbers. We feel good about that for a variety of reasons but also because of even the category growth comps year-over-year. Remember, laundry grew about 4.5% year ago, 4.5% in the first half and about 2% in the second half. So, we have some good tailwinds on that perspective too.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. Just one follow-up, guys, if I may. Matt, any update, any commentary you can share on the M&A pipeline, any particular areas you're seeing, valuations et cetera, that would be helpful. And then with respect to the small tuck-in deal, the Agro BioSciences sort of additive in the specialty business. So broadly with that, Matt, so specialty is like less than 10% of mix. What role do you kind of see with specialty? Do you have any sort of percentage in mind or is there an aversion to how high you would take specialty as a percent of the company's mix within sort of the broader household products and personal care portfolio? Would you ever take – should the asset present itself, would you take the business up to 15% to 20% of mix? Just curious as to how you see that. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I would say that the Specialty Products business and particularly animal productivity business is a business that we'd like to get as big as it can get. And the reason for that is that, it's completely on trend, A. B, we have a base in technology and science behind it. From a financial standpoint, its operating margins are close to the consumer business and its asset-light. So, it meets all of our criteria frankly of the business that we would buy. It just happens to be a business that we've had for many, many years. And now because of the trend towards non-antibiotics to raise production animals, we find ourselves in the sweet spot. So, we bought a business in January 2015 called VI-COR and that was a prebiotic business. And we just picked up this fantastic business in Wisconsin, Agro BioSciences. And these guys can customize probiotics for their customers, I mean it's just a wonderful business model. So, we think the combination of those two businesses with our existing business is going to make us less cyclical, A, and, B, able to serve more than the dairy market going forward. So, we feel real good about that business.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Meanwhile, Kevin, I mean, you should see in the release, right, we did sell the chemical business down in Brazil, so it's investing where the future is.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks. First question is just kind of talking about the key categories, you're directing your promotional dollars to in Q2. And then also, perhaps, you can give a little bit of color on what your expectations are on volume versus price mix and specifically for Q2 given the step-up in promotional spend?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. A lot of this with respect to promotional spend, we wouldn't be very specific about where that's going. We do have to narrow some gaps a bit in laundry. So, laundry, we actually were down year-over-year in our spend for ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN as the percentage sold on deal. So, that gap has widened a bit with some of our competitors. So, that would be one area we would put some money to work. So, we'll selectively use some promotions and couponing in Q2 and Q3, just to narrow those gaps.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And then from a volume, price mix in Q2, we think volume is going to be up about 3% to 4% and price mix will be a drag of 1% to 2%. And that's also why margin came down for the full year from 60% to 40%. So, that's the short answer.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. And then, back to the M&A and Specialty. Could you talk about the growth rate of that business to kind of warrant a 7 times multiple, I mean excuse my ignorance, but is that just the going rate for livestock probiotics at this point?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. We don't always look at the trailing EBITDA or sales multiple, Olivia. But I would tell you that on a forward EBITDA multiple, we're 10 times or less. And that business is going to grow really fast and that's our expectation.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And then a combination of that business with our organization is, we're going to work real hard to make sure they hit that earn-out target.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly on OXICLEAN, the restage that you're planning, it sounds like your doubling down again. And obviously, laundry has been a very tough category the last couple of years, whether it'd be for sales and products et cetera, et cetera. So, can you talk a little bit about the plans and what's changing for OXICLEAN this time around?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, you're going to be – you'll see it on shelf soon. So, we have a new bottle, and we've got new claims which – they aren't public either right now and a new advertising. So yeah, you say we've launched it a couple years ago, 2014 and we've kind of gone sideways for a couple of years around a 1-share. And of course, Persil came in I guess 2015 and so that was unexpected. So now, we've kind of retrenching and restaging the business and we feel good about our prospects.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just on the industry trends, saying that the things are looking better in April. I mean, we've heard that from a few others. Any reason why you think that is and do you think that – or why you think that will continue?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I wouldn't say we – it's better in comparison to January and February. I think we're still thinking the categories will be between 1.5% and 2% for the year. So, we've kind of looked it as a blip sort of recovery. We're not euphoric. We're not saying that, hey, it's blue skies and cool breezes in the rest of the year, but it's better than it was, Bill. So, I think, we're kind of back to where we thought we were in February when we gave our full year outlook.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And on Olivia's question on the restage of OXI and maybe just what you're seeing out of Henkel in general? If you're seeing any change from the Sun, Henkel, if you're expecting anything? But also, with the thought that maybe OXI's initial prospects were deemed by the strong launch of Persil. Are you rethinking on pricing or where it should be positioned as you restage that whole product?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, we haven't changed the position. I mean, it is just a slightly under a Tide Persil again from a price standpoint. As far as what we see out of the Sun-Henkel combination. All you can really look at is tactics and how much was sold on deal in Q1 this year versus last year. I can comment with respect to Purex. Purex brand was pretty much the same last year versus this year. There was a significant increase in Sun sold on deal, like 41% versus 35% last year in Q1. So, you might say they got a little more promotional on the lower end. But on the top end, Persil is still doing well. We continue to take some share. So we have to find our niche below Tide and Persil, and we think we've found a way to do that.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And last one for me. Is there an expectation of where SLIDE can get in terms of share? I mean, are you thinking high single-digits by the end of the year?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: We're not going to do any grandstanding right now. We just feel real good about the launch. It's only been out there for a few weeks now. So we'll update you again in August, but we like the way consumers are reacting to it. It's a good insight.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Sounds great. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, Bill.
Operator: Our next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hi. Thank you, good morning. So, I just wanted to ask first about the laundry category, just following up on Bill's question. So it seems like you're gaining a lot of share in laundry, especially if we look at the four-week data. So is that just the new products, or do you think you've gained more shelf space relative to Henkel and P&G? And then just if you could talk about trends outside the scanned channels in laundry for your business.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, well, laundry outside the scanned channels, I wouldn't say is much of a story for us right now. It's more on shelf. People still do buy – that's a category that's less developed from online versus bricks and mortar. Yeah, as far as how we're doing. I mentioned that ARM & HAMMER liquid grew share again in the first quarter for the 29th consecutive quarter. ARM & HAMMER grew 30 bps in the first quarter. Where our issue is, is on Oxi and XTRA, so that's what we run into. On the XTRA side, we lost 30 bps when we do the discounting. So that's one of the reasons why we're going to have to close some of those gaps in the next couple of quarters. We get our fair share of distribution gains just like other folks. We have strong brands, particularly ARM & HAMMER, so some of it is distribution, but the success of ARM & HAMMER in the first quarter was not promotionally driven. As I mentioned earlier that we actually sold less on deal in Q1 2017 than 2016. And now, we got the new triple-chamber launching, so we feel great about that, right? So ARM & HAMMER grew share in Q1 without it. And now, we're finally showing up with that. And our unit dose share, if you combine Oxi and ARM & HAMMER, it's over a 4-share. So, we got to get our fair share back in unit dose. That's the future, so that's where we're putting our money.
Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just on this new acquisition, the probiotics. What is the – I know you said the forward EBITDA multiple was around 10 times. Should we think of it as a next year forward multiple, or is it more sort of out of the future? Just if we could think about the timing and just sort of how big the opportunity could be next year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Next year. Next year forward multiple around 10 times. That's a good way to think about it.
Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for -
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congrats on a pretty solid result in a tough environment out there.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Clearly, International was a strong source of strength for you guys with that 12% growth. A couple questions on that. Can you give us a little more context and color about exactly what it is and where that growth is coming from? And then related, your guidance of 6% to 7% implies sort of a decel to 4% to 5% – 5%. Is that just sort of prudent conservatism, or is there real reason to think that the business could sort of come back down to earth?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, look, first off, you've heard us say on other calls in the past that export can be a little bit lumpy. So that's a bit of it. As far as where the success is coming from, you've heard us say we got new leadership, we got new regional hub that's certainly helping the export business, but we have a focus on brands. So, the important brands for us in the International is STERIMAR which is a nasal hygiene, FEMFRESH which is feminine hygiene and BATISTE of course which is dry shampoo. And then we've had success with ARM & HAMMER in Canada and Mexico. So, there's a lot of effort around those brands and that concentrated effort has been paying dividends for us. As far as the rest of – are we sad because the rest of the year isn't 11% and for the next three quarters, no. We've taken Europe from 4% to 5% to 6% to 7%, and we think that's a prudent way to think about the year.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I agree. There's nothing too disappointing on that 4% to 5%, if that is with the rest of the year. Turning to – well, as you offset 6% to 7%, you're not upping your overall sales, so kind of what's moving a little bit lower in that algorithm?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. Yes. So, we said 2.5% to 3% for domestic beginning of the year. So, we're shaving that back down to 2.5%.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, largely because of the incremental trading and promotional activity. I think volumes are still as strong as they were, in our opinion.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Makes sense. One more question and I'll pass it on. The 110 bps of outperformance, pretty big fade from 300 bps, kind of back to normal long term. I think we've always had roughly 100. What drove the fade and is there any sort of lumpiness we should think about on that as we think through the rest of the year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. So you really asked about gross margin, why is it going down so much and...
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, no, no. The sales outdelivery. Sorry, consumer domestic, the 110 basis points of overdelivery versus measured channels. That was closer to 300 when you finished the last year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Got you. Yeah. I think part of that, when we're talking last year especially, we had some of the club channel helping that number. This is purely largely online untracked channels because we're confident in any of the club benefits.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hi, Joe.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, first question. I wanted to go back to marketing and promo and obviously, you guys mentioned this morning that you're kind of increasing spend in the second and third quarter out of the fourth quarter. Is that due to the timing of your innovation or it's just right now, you're seeing a really competitive environment given where some of your competitors are spending?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. On the marketing side, Joe, I would just tell you that kind of consistent with what we said in February, over the last few years, we had just seen an increase really in Q4, on top of Q4 increases. So, we want to move some of that money back to where it belongs in support of the new products and that's what we're doing by moving it to Q2 and Q3. On a trade and couponing perspective, I'd say it's really across the board in Q2 and Q3, and so hopefully, that helps.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Is there a risk that fourth quarter doesn't come down to that, so it remains at a high level?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: There's some in Q4 too. But we're pretty laid back about it. I think as we said before, we expect category growth to be 1.5% and 2%. And we've done the marketing shift, we've put the coupon in and trade in place. And so, that's what we're confident about a 3% call for the year.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then secondly, on litter, like you mentioned the new SLIDE product is off to a good start. Clorox mentioned yesterday, they gained some share, Tidy Cats has done very well. So, curious what the overall ARM & HAMMER business is doing in terms of market share. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. You're right. We lost some share in the first quarter, but the latest four weeks, now we're up and we're up with the categories. So, we think the SLIDE is going to start pulling the train for us the rest of the way.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, Joe.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, I was hoping if you can pretty much understand how TROJAN was weaker this quarter and how – I know you were staging a new contain as you pointed out in the – so were you just like reducing the advertisement spend so that you can stage it for the second quarter? And also if you can touch on how you're spending. I'm assuming in these categories are under the radar like dry shampoo and probiotics, that you're gaining market share and also gaining distribution. So, if you can touch on that. Then lastly if you can contemplate bolt-ons internationally, given that you have been so lucky with – not lucky I should say, so efficient on the growth in Mexico and Canada, so, potentially being a white space for you guys. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Normally, you only get one or two, you got three.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes, so I'll take the TROJAN one really quick. So, your question was why is TROJAN down. Well, in context with my earlier answer on marketing spend, we did – marketing spend was down for TROJAN in Q1 because we wanted to move it into Q2 and Q3 in support of our new products. So, we hope to see that trend reverse as we increase our marketing spend and our new XOXO condom launches.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And also, with TROJAN, that's a more developed category with respect to online. So, when you look at the measured channels, there is always a shift going to online purchases. And your second question was on International?
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. About M&A, if you would contemplate bolt-ons abroad.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And so, will we contemplate, say that again?
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: M&A abroad. So, let's say bolt-on acquisitions that you could find in countries like Mexico or Canada or other countries or even the U.K.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. 2011 is when we acquired the BATISTE business and more recently, we just bought a business from J&J, which is a hemorrhoid business that's in multiple countries, primarily U.K., South Africa, Australia, Canada, so, certain English-speaking countries. So, yeah, we did one recently, and we do want to build out our International business. So, we are on the hunt for acquisitions outside the U.S. And we apply the same criteria to those as we do for domestic acquisitions. So, yes. And your last question was the advent – are probiotics becoming more important to vitamin?
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. No, I was just hoping if you can touch on how you, obviously you are advancing on market share on those categories. But how much of your growth probably is coming from, for example, your organic growth that you had in the first quarter is coming from these new businesses, if you will, or new distribution?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We don't get into that brand-level detail on organic growth. I would just say even for next year in 2018, you're going to see some of those small acquisitions play a good role in organic growth. But for now, it's all – we'd be calling that out separately for reported growth anyway. Not really lot to add there.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Anderson with William Blair. Your line is open.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, Matt. Hi, Rick.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Two quick ones for me. Wonder if you could talk broadly about e-commerce and which particular categories or brands are bigger for you in the e-commerce channel? And do you think you have your kind of fair share in e-commerce relative to kind of conventional and kind of what you're doing there to make sure that is the case? And then the second question is just an update on BATISTE both in the U.K. and the U.S. and if that's continuing to see the kind of growth that you're looking for within that brand. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. As far as online goes, you may have heard us say, or maybe others, that in general, consumer products companies have 1% to 3% of their global sales online. And not too long ago, we were at 1% and then we moved to 2%. So today, we're at 3%, that's our run rate. And in the U.S., it's 4% of our net sales. So that continues to build for us, so consequently then we have to become a lot more sophisticated in facing that market. And it's – certainly it's Amazon, it's Walmart.com, Target.com, it's all the big direct companies. So we have to interface with all of these folks for this new online class of trade. But I would say it's building, it's more developed in the U.S. than outside the U.S. As I said, it's 4% in the U.S., it's less internationally, but it's going to continue to build. What was your second question?
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: A question on BATISTE.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Oh, yeah, BATISTE. BATISTE has been a rocket ship for us. One of the things we've pointed out is that the U.K. market in dollars is a $60 million market, and it's a country with 60 million people. And the growth of the dry shampoo market in the U.S. has just been astonishing. It grows 20% to 30% a quarter year over year. It's now $120 million, and of course we have over 300 million people in the U.S. So you would think that this category has got a lot of runway ahead of it, and is going to generate a lot of growth for the company in the future. So hope that helps you.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Shirley Serrao for Lauren Lieberman. Just wanted to talk a little bit about non-tracked channels. They're clearly emerging as a significant contributor to top line. Could you talk about what kind of investments you're making here? Is it primarily online and club, or are you exploring new channels beyond this? Is there room to innovate or push further? Just some more color would be great. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The non-tracked channels would be club, but it would also be online, would also be beauty. So you've got three channels there to think about when you're trying to reconcile between non-measured and reported numbers. And I would say we treat all the channels similarly. I mean, obviously, there's some sophistication in digital marketing, which digital marketing also is going to (41:31) all your bricks-and-mortar marketing. So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular we're doing differently, treating those particular retailers than other retailers. Hope that helps you.
Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.
Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Hi, how you doing? This is Armani Khoddami in for Jon Feeney. So maybe -
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Good morning.
Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Yeah, how are you? So maybe a quick follow-up there on the non-tracked benefit. It sounds like, Rick, you said that you guys are comping some wins in club or Costco last year? Could you elaborate maybe what those are that are now sort of in the base? And then with the majority of the non-tracked benefit now coming, e-commerce and beauty, like you were just saying, I mean, this seems to be – a lot of it is BATISTE. Could you talk about the opportunity on BATISTE still a lot of distribution wins, or do you feel like now that you're in ULTA and in some of the other mass outlets, is it mostly just the penetration? Thank you very much.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, sure, I'll take the first one. So, just to reemphasize what I told Jason, he was asking there was a 300 basis point difference between our kind of our tracked and untracked organic growth from a year ago. And that was really driven because we had some club wins and we had some high – some growth online. We've anniversaried that growth, and in Q1, it's largely solely online growth, which is still significant. I mean, we have businesses like vitamins, for example, or like condoms that you heard Matt allude to that are doubling year over year. Right? So, we just have some really strong growth online.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. As far as BATISTE goes, yes, we continue to get distribution. We are the number one brand, and our share continues to expand as the category grows. So we're getting new distribution, but we're getting, what's really driving it is velocity. There's just so much demand for the product and being a number one brand, we're winning. And we actually have the best product out there as far as efficacy goes, so it's just a combination of both great marketing, good claims and the best product.
Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning, guys. Wanted to ask first just a housekeeping. The shelf space for the three-chamber pod, is that coming from existing or are you guys getting a bit of incremental shelf placement for that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Yeah we're getting some incremental space with the pod upgrade.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Remember retails are putting a lot more focus on pods over time, so that shelf space is growing.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then, second just on thoughts about creating even more specialized packaging for key product categories that you could sell, whether being sold online in an increasing way. Do you think there's a need to do it? Do you think it creates a bit of a competitive advantage in doing so, especially as I sort of think about perhaps some of your competitors being a bit slower moving in decisions like that. I think there's a necessity, opportunity, just any sort of thoughts there would be helpful.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, I think that's true. The online packaging is and will be different for a lot of categories going forward. So, that's one thing we're looking at across all of our categories. And that's a big change. But as our company, we always – as you correctly point out, is we move quickly and focus in speed is, those are the two hallmarks of Church & Dwight, and we look at change as our friend. So, we like our chances to the extent that people are going to move quickly to different packaging where appropriate and be first.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right. There's no further questions. I want to thank you all for tuning in today and we'll talk to you again in August.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight Fourth Quarter and Year-End Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you, operator. Okay, welcome everybody and everybody that's joining online. We have the whole management team here with us today. We appreciate the opportunity to tell the Church & Dwight story. I'm going to provide some color on five of our categories. I'm going to talk about our 2017 innovation and consumer insights that led to that innovation. If you read the press release, you know we closed a couple of bolt-on acquisitions recently. So, I say a few words about that. Rick is going to get up and give us the thinking on 2017 and then we'll have Q&A with the whole management team. Okay. Here's the safe harbor statement, which I encourage everybody to read and let's just jump right in. So, for those of us who know us, or know the story, but if you're new to the story, we started in 1846 with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Today we're a $3.5 billion diversified company with dozens of brands and we do on the slide – too fast. Here we go. Okay. We have 10 brands, we're a little bit out of sequence there. We have 10 brands that represent 80% of our revenues and profits and we're a serial acquirer. So those of you who know us, the only brand that we had in the year 2000 was ARM & HAMMER and since then 9 of our 10 brands have been acquired. So, we have a long history of acquisitions. If you go back to 2004, you can see our sales were $1.5 billion and today we're a $3.5 billion company. And we have a very specific acquisition criteria. Just to kind of roll through them, we buy number-one or number-two brands, high-margin brands, we like asset-light businesses and we're able to leverage our extensive supply chain, which I'll say a little bit more later on and these brands always deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. Keep moving. Okay. So, we regard ourselves as an acquisition platform. So it's been part of our story over the past 15 years that we acquire businesses but also on top of that we have organic growth. The businesses we acquire we grow, we get operational efficiencies and we have a stellar acquisition track record and we have a fabulous balance sheet which will be plus-rated. Okay. We're primarily a U.S. company, so there's two good things about that. We have less exposure than others to currencies and the other positive is that we have the opportunity to grow international and you can see over the past couple of years, we had stellar results internationally. Okay. We're pretty balanced, right, so we split household and personal care pretty much 50-50 and then we have a specialty products business which is primarily bulk sodium bicarbonate and we have an animal nutrition business as well. And we've delivered stellar results to our shareholders over time, you can see on this slide. Okay. I'm going to talk about five categories now, so I want to – it's instructional. So, we're trying to see what's going on. I'm going to showcase our 2017 innovation. I'm going to start with laundry, right. So, laundry has been a growing category and the growth has been driven by unit dose over time. So, if you go from left to right on this slide, so the leftmost side of this slide is a four-year look. You see 2013 and 2014 the category was down and then started to grow in 2015 and 2016. So, let's take a closer look at 2016, look at the quarters. So Q1, you had an unsustainable organic growth of plus 6%, what does that mean, it means it's going to be a tough comp for the first quarter of 2017. Q4, you see there's a slowdown, right. So, this is the first quarter by the way in two years that have negative price in this category and it's concentrated in the liquid part of the category. So, let's take a look at that. So, here is liquid again, left to right, similar trend. Down in 2013 and 2014, up 2015 and 2016 and a similar trend for 2016 quarters if you go left to right. So, let's look at the fourth quarter of 2016 for liquid. So, you have negative price mix of almost 3%. So, what is driving that? So, let's take a closer look, so let's look at the competitor activity in the fourth quarter. So, you have elevated levels of promotion in Q4. So, the category sold on deal is normally mid-30s. The Simply Tide dialed it up to 60% in the fourth quarter. Sun also took it up to 43%. ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, both in the 30s. So, we didn't promote nearly as much as our competitors in the fourth quarter. Despite this level of spend, so ARM & HAMMER laundry continued to grow share in the fourth quarter. XTRA is where we have the share issue. So, two brands up, this is full-year now, so ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN up in 2016, XTRA down. The good news on XTRA is that we grew net sales and gross profit in 2016. Now, let's look at the share story. So, XTRA has been the drag on share, ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN up. Remember, this is only measured channels, too. So, ARM & HAMMER laundry had a very strong year in non-measured channels, especially in club, and that's not reflected in Nielsen. Okay. Let's talk about unit dose. So, unit dose in 2015 was 14% of the category; in 2016, it's 16% of the category. So, here's the unit dose category trend. You can see 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016. And so, we're up small numbers initially, so big growth in 2013, but it's sort of leveled out into low 20s growth as a category. You can see the quarters on the right-hand side of this slide here for 2016. So – and this is our history now. So, you can see we have bumbled along here for a couple of years, and in 2016, we finally got some traction. So, in late 2015, we introduced bi-layer powder, and we also introduced a two-chamber pod. So, we got some traction and now it's starting to show up in our shares. So, from a share perspective, we're making progress. So, up 30 bps in 2016, 3.7% going to 4% so the winners were Church & Dwight and Sun, the losers were Procter and Henkel in pods in 2016. Okay. So, we expect to make much more progress in pods in 2017 with our new triple-chamber pod. So, multiple chambers communicate multiple benefits to consumers. Now, let's move on to litter. So, litter again a growing category historically. Here's the last four years, 2013 through 2016. Volume was most of the category growth by the way in 2016 of 4.4%. And we have a long history of innovation. So, we have a 12% CAGR. This is at retail sales, but in ARM & HAMMER, litter grew approximately 3% of retail in 2016, and consumer insights drive our innovation. So, the original CLUMP & SEAL was driven by the desire for odor control. This has been a huge winner for us. Then certain consumers told us that they were concerned about bacterial odors, so that was the origin of CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. And the latest, which Lou took you through before we started this presentation, and we do some more now, cleaning the litter box is a nightmare for consumers. So, today we're introducing ARM & HAMMER, CLUMP & SEAL SLIDE. So, cat owners love this product. There are three great benefits, the litter slides right out of the box, there's no scrubbing and it doesn't stick to the pan. We have a few commercials to run for you now. [Video Presentation] (08:31-09:16) Okay, this is going to be a big winner for us in 2017. Okay. Vitamins is another growth area for us. So, here's the adult vitamin category over the last four years. I could see that also was a big grower initially, but kind of slowed down as the category's gotten bigger, but an 18%, 19% grower in the past year. So, if you look at the form, so that – how is the transition from pills and capsules going to gummies these days. So, in 2012, it was 3% of the category, 2016 it's 11% of the category, and here's some factoids here. So, almost 70% of U.S. adults take a dietary supplement and of those, 75% take a multivitamin, and we are the number one gummy vitamin both in adult and in children's vitamins. And a new innovation for us, we're entering the energy category. So, less people say they need more energy, so one of our new product launches in 2017 is an energy gummy. So, we're entering the energy space with an energy gummy source from green tea and our new gummy has a great taste consistent with the VITAFUSION line. Okay. Condoms. The condom category is beginning to shift to online. I want to show you some stats on this now for a second. So, here is the measured channel story over the last few years. You can see down 2013, flat 2014, down 2015, down 2016, yet TROJAN sales and gross profit are up single digits in 2016. So there's a shift to digital going on right now and the shift to digital is becoming increasingly part of the story for many CPG companies. So, 2017 we're introducing a condom aimed at the female buyer. One out of three condoms are purchased by women. So today, we're launching TROJAN XOXO. So, three features there: soft touch, aloe-based lubricant, a unique carrying case and we have more great news. TROJAN XOXO will be advertised on network television in 2017. So, let's hope this one will grow well now. You can roll the commercial. [Video Presentation] (11:32-12:02) Okay. Look for that on network television in 2017. Okay. Next stop, Dry Shampoo, so this is – Dry Shampoo is a superfast-growing segment of the hair care category, but this is all of shampoo now. If you look 2012 versus 2016, Dry Shampoo was only 1% of total shampoo; in 2016, it's 4%. And you've heard us talk about this before of this fabulous category to be in, so in 2012 at retail in the U.S. was $32 million; 2016, $115 million. So the question is, where can this go? And this will give you some sense for how fast it's growing, so this thing is going to double again. So, just a little bit of context. In the UK, this is a $63 million category and the population of the UK is 60 million, so we have five times the population in the United States, so this has the potential of being a $300 million category. Today, only a $150 million category. And there's a big household penetration story here, so look at some of these statistics, so there are 125 million in the U.S. over the age of 18 and two-thirds don't wash their hair every day, but only 13% of that crowd uses dry shampoo. So, a lot of runway ahead of us here and we have the number one brand and we've been growing share as the category has been growing. So, it's just a fabulous story there. And again, two more variants, keep expanding the line, we have new BATISTE there, it has a light scent, so it doesn't conflict with your perfume and then we have the fun one on the right-hand side of this slide, vibrant & fruity neon. Okay. So, how we deliver as the company, if you're a shareholder, you're familiar with all of these things I'm going to run through right now, I'm not going to list them, but I'm going to bomb through them one by one. Okay. Very diversified product portfolio. You know the split, right, 60% premium, 40% value. So, how do we build our shares? Pretty simple formula, right. We have great innovation, we have super marketing and we have a great sales team to increase our distribution and that results in share growth. Okay, innovation I ran through already. So, we have the triple-chamber pod in 2017, we have Slide, we have the energy gummy, we have XOXO and BATISTE. But we have lots of other innovation in in other categories that I'm not going to run through right now, but some of them are depicted on the screen. And marketing spending, so we're the 18th largest advertiser in the United States. That comes as a surprise to some people. And our sweet spot is anywhere from 12% to 13% marketing as a percentage of sales and you can see the history here, 2013 through 2016. And there is continually a shift to digital. We talked about – I'm going to talk about litter in a second, but 2011, it was 13% and in 2016, it's 28% of our spend. Here's a good illustration. So, this is the best illustration for us of the efficiency of digital. So, one-third of U.S. households own a cat. So, those are the people we want to target. So, what digital enables you to do is to segment, target, educate, and then engage in conversation on relevant websites like for example Pet360 and then to drive sales online. Yeah. Not only online, but also retail. Okay. Distribution, you know we're a pretty transparent company. This is 2013 index versus 2016, how do we look distribution for some of our major brands. If it's plus or minus 10%, we have it in gray. We'll call it a wash and the rest are green. Okay. Finally, share. So, I talked about transparency as a company, you won't find a score card in many CPG presentations. So, let's kind of roll down the page here. So, we had 4 out of our 10 power brands grew share in 2016, and these are measured channels only and as you know the non-measured channel is increasingly part of the story, but this is the information available to everybody through Nielsen. Okay. So ARM & HAMMER, so the only ARM & HAMMER variant that declined in 2016 was litter. The winner in the litter category was Nestlé with Tidy Cat, Clorox has been flat with their two brands and so we've lost some share, but the total brand for ARM & HAMMER grew sales and profits in 2016. OXICLEAN, second one on the list, we had record share in the fourth quarter. TROJAN, again, net sales and profits were up, non-measured channels becoming a factor. Vitamins, a very good story for us. FIRST RESPONSE, we were hurt by some discounting in private label, we're turning that around. The fourth quarter for FIRST RESPONSE we had our highest quarterly share ever. Nair, doing really well there for many years, we have Wax-Ready Strips that are growing in the category. XTRA, we talked about a dip. Skip down to Orajel, so this private label has been hurting us there and BATISTE has been a big winner. So, 4 out of 10, we hope to turn some of these around in 2017 with our innovation. Okay. International growth, fabulous story for us. So, here's the picture, so you have eight flags up here, but we only have six countries. So, we have two new regional centers; we have one in Asia; and one in Central America. You may have heard us talk about this on previous calls that international is an area of investment for us for the past two years and for obvious reasons. So, we have a fabulous track record in growing our top line in international. So, you can see and this is broad-based. So, you go from left to right, you can see the CAGRs country by country and all are positive. And the way we run the businesses by the way is in Europe, UK and France are combined. So, we really have five business units within international. Okay, gross margin. Rick is going to talk about this a little bit later on, but gross margin is a big focus within our company. And we continue to grow year-over-year, 2014, 2015 and 2016. And what are the drivers for that? Number one is our continuous improvement program we call good to great. Second is supply chain optimization. What does that mean? Those are the plants that we've opened over the past couple of years. We have a new vitamin plant, we have a new West Coast plant that we opened up. New products obviously is a driver because a lot of the new products that we've launched have higher gross margins than the products they're replacing. And finally, acquisition. So, we try to buy businesses that have higher than corporate gross margins. All right, and here's another secret weapon is that gross margin is 25% of our employees' annual bonus and that's one way we create alignment within the company. People know what gross margin is. Growth through acquisitions, I listed those earlier, but I want to call one of them out, so that's the fourth one on the page there, we've leveraged CHD capital base. So, what does that mean? We can be agnostic about the businesses that we look at and that's because we can put the liquid in a bottle, powder in a box. We can handle gels, lotions, aerosols, regulated businesses and we have an extensive co-packer network. So it gives us the confidence to look at a lot of acquisition candidates in various categories. Okay, some statistics then. What happens after you buy the brand? So in every case, we have higher shares, we grow share once we acquire a business. And a couple of ones that you saw on our press release, VIVISCAL and the J&J brand. So, VIVISCAL is a brand that's been around since 1997, 80% of the sales are in the U.S. and its three year sales CAGR is 30%. And so this is a complementary business to our growing hair business which is our BATISTE brand and the TOPPIK brand that we bought a year ago. And then a couple of brands we bought from J&J, this adds scale to our international business. That's ANUSOL and RECTINOL. 90% of the business is in Canada, the UK, Australia and it's a perfect fit for our international business where we can add some scale. Okay. And then you saw this earlier, $1.4 billion company going to $3.5 billion over time. Okay. Free cash flow, Rick's going to talk about this a little bit later, but we have stellar free cash flow. This is one thing that I think a lot of our shareholders focus on, is that our cash earnings per share is significantly higher than our reported book EPS. Overhead management, so we run a really tight ship at Church & Dwight. I mean, the only CPG company that's better than us at managing SG&A is Reckitt. Rick's going to say more about this later on to give you some insight into the components of SG&A. But for my part, I want to point out that we've been investing in international. I mentioned that earlier over the past couple of years, we're going to continue to invest in international. Second thing, you're thinking IT investments, we're no different than any other company, but we have an extremely productive employee base, we can become even more productive if you make this investment. And R&D, if it's a natural, this is where you want to continue to invest to drive your innovation. Okay. So, we have a very simple incentive compensation plan and this is the secret sauce, right. So we have a financially literate company and we have four measures, right. We have sales, gross margin, cash from operations and EPS. And our long-term incentives are aligning with shareholders, it's only options. Okay. And then, how we run the company? Okay. So, you know we focus on number-one brands, we like to be asset-light and we have a super workforce. If you had these three, which we do, you would have really good results. But when you lever – when you put on top of that the competency we have as a company to acquire businesses, integrate them, and create more value, you get fabulous shareholder returns. Here's our evergreen model, it's unchanged, a 3% top line, 8% bottom line, and 50% operating margin expansion. Rick is going to spend a little bit of time on that. Cool, thanks. So, we talked about the evergreen model. Our geographic focus were mostly U.S., but we're investing more internationally. Our acquisition criteria we've reviewed, and the allocation of capital, which is very deliberate, Rick's going to run through this but from top to bottom those are in order, where we direct our cash flow. Okay. Rick, you're up.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to go through three things with you guys. First the quarter, then the full-year 2016 results, and then we'll go through, spend some time on the 2017 outlook. So, first off is the quarter, 2.7% organic sales growth. Remember our outlook was 1% to 2%, so we overdelivered on all three of the divisions, so that was a great result. Consumer organic, which is the international and the domestic division added together, that was 3.5% for the quarter. Our organic growth like many quarters was largely volume-driven at 3.2%, gross margin was up 60 basis points. I have a separate slide on the gross margin bridge that – we'll talk through that. And then operating margin was up 50 basis points. EPS was up 7% to $0.44 and remember our outlook was around $0.42, so I'm just really pleased with that result. So, you saw some late-breaking news in the release this morning, we announced that we're selling our Brazilian chemical business, and now there is a small charge in 2016 of $0.02, small charge in 2017 of $0.02, but at the end of the day that's a good thing for the company, it just allows us to be focused even more on our consumer business in Brazil, small business, but growing. From a phasing perspective, organically, you can see the stair-step was going down through the quarters, but it's up in Q4, right. Remember our domestic, organically we were 0.8% in the third quarter, we were 2.7% in the fourth quarter. So, again going in the right direction. We had solid growth throughout the year. This is the two-year stack of the consumer business, domestic plus international, 8% for the two-year number, 4% in 2015, 4% in 2016. You can see the second half is 6% to 7%, which is solid growth as well and that stair-step down is really – probably the most pertinent item is the laundry category, right. Laundry category averaged about 4% category growth in the first half; about 2%, which is probably more of a sustainable number, in the back half. Okay. Turning to full year, so 3.2% organic, which is fantastic. Domestic was 3.1%, international was 10%, that's a high watermark for that division. Steve and his team did a great job. SPD was a 7% drag. We've been upfront on that all year long as milk pricing has been going down. But the good news is from Q3 to Q4 sequentially, milk pricing has gone up about 6% and you'll hear in our outlook that we expect growth out of that division in 2017. Again, I'm going to defer the gross margin story for another slide or two. We had a bridge in the full year. Marketing was essentially flat at 12.2%, SG&A was up 50 basis points for all the reasons Matt laid out and also incentive comp as we had really strong cash flow, really strong margin and results overall. EPS was up 9%, $1.77, and cash is a little over $600 million and net adjusted free cash flow of 131%. So, Matt talked to you about the 6- or 7-year average of 120%, 130%, just phenomenal. Okay. Here's the gross margin detail. If you look at Q4 commodities, it's flat, that kind of marks an inflection point for us, right. The whole year, commodities have been a bit of a tailwind, and you see that in the full year section. So, commodities are starting to turn a little bit, you're going to hear in 2017, we expect there to be some moderate inflation. Productivity and manufacturing, that's the J&J program that Matt referenced, 100 basis points from there, plus margin accretive acquisitions offset by higher promotional volume and mix, and that's how you get 60 basis points for the quarter. For the full year, the 60 basis points from commodities and the productivity gain of 70 basis points essentially gives 120 basis points for the full year. So, just really, this is the biggest increase we've had in gross margin for a few years. So, very happy about that. Okay. Free cash flow conversion, we talk about this all the time, we talk about cash all the time, and 120% is top of the consumer sector. Our peers average in general about 100%, some peers target about 90%. So to have 120% year-in, year-out, and 130% this year is a good result. And how can we do that? Probably one of the biggest reasons that we can do that is the way we manage the balance sheet through our cash conversion cycle. That's inventory plus receivables minus payables. And so, we've gone from 52 days over the last seven years to 21 days. That's hundreds of millions of dollars out of the balance sheet that we can put to use, right. And we have aspirational goals of getting down to zero, and we do have some peers that have done that, actually gone negative. So, we try to look at that all the time. So, I've said we had a strong balance sheet, we're 1.4 times levered, so we have a lot of capacity to do a lot of deals and to use our balance sheet in a good way. So, as an example we could do a $2.8 billion deal, and we believe it would maintain our credit rating at BBB+, which would be really important to us. Okay, I'm going to spend about 5 minutes on this slide. This is the 2017 outlook, a lot of moving pieces, so I just want to make sure we're all grounded. So, first off, 3% for organic growth, right. That's right in line with our evergreen model. That breaks up 2.5% to 3% for the domestic business, 4% to 5% international and 2% to 3% for the SPD business. So, again, they return to growth in 2017. So, the backdrop for the domestic business is we're assuming a little bit slower growth in categories, probably around 2%. So, to the extent categories do better, we'll do better and vice versa. All right. Gross margin is up 60 basis points despite moderate inflation, despite higher promotional spending expectations. So these, what I would think about that, is 40 basis points from the acquisitions, these gross margin accretive acquisitions, offset by 40 basis points of higher commodity cost, higher promotional spending, FX drag, it's like it's back to zero and then plus 60 basis points from productivity and just leveraging our volume. So, that's kind of the detail behind the gross margin outlook. Marketing is up. We're spending back a little bit more money in marketing to help drive those new products and help drive the brands. SG&A is actually up 10 basis points, but you can be assured that we haven't lost our way there, right. We – our TSR model, evergreen model says we typically leverage that 20, 25 basis points. I'm going to walk you through what's going on behind the numbers there. Other income and expenses, a drag of $14 million, and behind that number is about $20 million of interest expense, right. Half of that's because of interest rates are going up and half of that is just having the debt – our debt expectations for the new deals. For the tax rate – all the adjusted items exclude the three adjustments we've talked about before; the pension, the Brazil, and the stock accounting FASB change. So, we're up 7% and that includes the higher marketing, that includes the slight drag from acquisitions and you might ask why do we have a drag from acquisitions. Well, these small deals are very global in nature. So, there's lots of countries involved. So we have to have transition services agreements all over the world as we integrate these things. So that's really why we have a drag. On a reported basis, we're at $1.73 midpoint and that includes the Brazil charge, it includes the UK pension contribution. We're out of the pension business, right. That's a great fact. And then of course the new stock option accounting. And I just want to draw your attention to, we said in the release as well the timing of EPS, right. We said roughly all of our EPS growth will come in the second half of the year. We're moving marketing dollars out of the second half and back into the first half. Over time those numbers would just creep up over time and we want to reallocate and do what's right for the business. Okay. So I'll just flip through some of the key metrics really quick. So our track record on organic sales, right. Solid track record from 2012 to 2017 and we've been between 3% and 4% over that timeframe and again in 2017 we're calling 3%. Gross margin is the hallmark of this company and it drives a lot of value. It drives a lot of cash earnings for the company and you can see the stair-step up all the way to 46.3%. So, great progress. Marketing spend has been pretty consistent and Matt alluded to that between 12% and 13%, we think that's the right number and again it's another year of increased marketing. Now on SG&A, I'll just take a minute to discuss this. So, you can see on reported basis that SG&A is up 60 basis points from 2014 to 2017. But I want to show you what it is on a cash basis. So, on a cash basis, we're pretty much flat. So if you look at 2014 to 2017, 11% to 11.1% and if you just take a second and look at the change of 2016 versus 2017, we're up 10 basis points on a reported basis, but we're down 20 basis points on a cash basis. So, we haven't lost our way. We have a mindset in this company, we've been doing zero-based planning for many, many years and so we have such a good hold over what our SG&A dollars are doing. On operating margin, this is a great result, 21.3%, a lot of personal care-type companies are trying to get to the low 20s, so we feel good about that number. EBITDA margin, it's a good surrogate for cash and cash earnings. This drives a lot of value. We've gone from the low-20s over time to the mid-20s and this is fantastic. EPS growth, so everything that came before is what leads to EPS growth and so we've had a few years of high single-digit EPS growth, 9% this year, 7% is the call for next year, $1.89. Okay. Allocation of capital, this is one of the most important things that we discussed, this doesn't change though. Number one far and away is accretive M&A, so we spent a lot of time, this management team spends a lot of time looking at deals. Number two is new product development, Matt walked you through a lot of those. Number three is CapEx for organic growth. Number four is return of cash to shareholders through dividends or through buybacks. And number five is debt reduction. And of course, if we did do a big deal number five would move to number one. We're not a capital-intensive company, we've walked through this many times, but our outlook for 2017 is around $55 million. If you take out the one-timers like capacity, installations, we bump around between $50 million to $60 million, so our outlook is right in line with our past practice. We announced this morning that we're increasing the dividend by 7%, high single-digit increase which is great, 40% payout, we're still right at that type number, this is 116 consecutive years of dividend. And I would be remiss if I didn't give you a comment or two on the proposed tax reform. I would say you guys know 80% of our sales are in the U.S., about 90% of our pre-tax income is in the U.S. 95% of our products sold in the U.S. market are sourced and produced domestically, so about 5% are imported. And so net-net imports and exports largely wash and it's kind of neutral. The best thing that could happen far and away for Church & Dwight is just the general corporate tax rate being lowered. But that's a quick perspective, we get that question a lot, so I want to give context. And with that, I think we'll invite the management team up and we'll take any sell-side questions we have.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. All right, gang. Come on up. It's not often you get the entire management team, so don't be bashful to ask some questions. We have virtually every function represented here. They're bumping around here. We had a terrific fourth quarter and just a really fabulous 2016. We're optimistic about 2017. So now we'll take your questions. Okay, Bill.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Two Bills there. Bill Schmitz?
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you guys bridge the organic growth and that negative 1% Nielsen to the roughly 3% in the consumer domestic business you did?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I used to masquerade as the finance guy. So, I'm going to...
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I remember, yeah.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: ...let the finance guy do that.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think I might – yeah, no problem. So, you'll see there in the Nielsen data for example, before we paid out, has been relatively weak and that's really track channels. So, we were slightly negative in track channels. We said in the release though about – if you think about it, we're slightly negative in track channels, but we're 2.8% organic from the consumer domestic division. And we said that that entire delta can be really explained by two things, about 300 basis points in total, about half in club and about half in the online channels. So, I would say that trend's probably going to continue. It's not going to get better over time, so that disconnect is going to be there.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, why isn't it like going into the first quarter, do you know what I mean because those trends, it seems like the club stuff is distribution more than growth, yeah, or is it growth have been club – do you know what I'm saying, like obviously, the e-commerce piece also should continue to grow. But I know that comp's a lot harder in the first quarter, but you'd think those trends would...
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think you hit it on the head, Bill. I think if anything, that the comp is overwhelming any trends that we're going to see in Q1, right. To be comping a 5% organic or 6% even household business growth in Q1 is going to be very difficult. But, so with all that said, we're going to have better growth than is in track channels, but the comp in Q1 just is very high, so our outlook is 1% to 2% Q1.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then what percentage of sales is e-commerce now?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: We've just said in the past, we're right in line with the 1% to 3%. So it's growing very quickly.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: But that's probably the....
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. We're right in the middle, around 2%.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And do you have big...
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, hey.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What's that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: We have a field of people.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I'm sorry.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You're on number four. Let's get the other Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Just on the laundry section, can you maybe, now over four or five months since the Henkel-Sun merger. Kind of thoughts of is this going to be good for the category in 2017, do you think it's good for the category in the long run, do you not have an idea at this point?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. That's a crystal ball question. So it's fair to say that when a large company buys another pretty good-sized company, a lot of their plans are already in place. So whatever Sun had in place for Q3, Q4, maybe even for 2017 is already in place. So, we don't really know – there's no evidence that says there's some obvious change in tactics because it's been going on for a few months. So here, we have to wait and see. There's one camp that says okay, you book, you get very promotional. The other camp would say, hey, people are going to be rational and it will be great for the category. So, we need a few quarters to figure that out and I'm sure it's going to be a question from everybody in Q1 and Q2, what's going on in the laundry. But as Rick points out, the comps, back to Bill's question, we have a 1% to 2% number in Q1 because our biggest quarter last year, we posted over a 5% organic number last year Q1, so that's a tough one to comp.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And just related to that, I mean, I didn't – I may have missed the thoughts of how you turnaround XTRA, that didn't seem to like there's any innovation, it's a price value-type position and that seems to be the one that's probably hit most by Sun. Are you optimistic you can turnaround this year and how do we do that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah – no, you're absolutely right. So, XTRA has lost share for three years in a row. As I pointed out, in 2016 XTRA grew our profit, so, and we haven't spent. So if you look at what we spent on a full-year basis for XTRA, we're around 37%, 38% sold on deal where it was simply tied and Sun 40% plus. So the question is, okay, you got to get into the game now to try to offset that because it's not indeed value, it's not really an innovation story, it's more of a price story. Yeah, Kevin. Only Kevin that we have.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Two questions if I may. So, Matt, can you comment on balancing a bit the market share performance, you guys lost market share in six of your largest 10 brands.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: In measured channels.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: I'm sorry – in measured channel, in measured channel. With the advertising marketing relatively flat, I know it's sort of consistent with your evergreen target. Does that lend itself, the market share dynamic, to the argument that maybe advertising marketing needs to step up a bit to stem some of these losses, if not gain share and then I have a follow-up question.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, I'm going to give you a couple of opening remarks and then I'm going to ask our CMO to comment. I'm may say what she's going to say. So, marketing is 12%-plus of your revenue, so it's a pot, you have to decide how you're going to deploy it. So you're going to move things around from one brand to the other. Now, some brands have tremendous equity and they can withstand having less spend on them in a given year and then you move the chips over to another brand. So, we will have to deploy it smartly so that we're going to get the right effect. And some of that measured channel versus unmeasured channel stuff we're pretty relaxed about, because we know, we see the numbers and everybody can't see it. It's going to create greater unease going forward, I think, if you're an investor and analyst to try to see what's going on in unmeasured channels, but I'll let Britta comment on that.
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Sure, sir. Just building on what Matt said, I think we have different reactions in different categories of advertising, so what you will see, Slide is very obvious, great innovation, you can see it, so advertising will drive a change very quickly, whereas other categories where advertising is constant, you can't see that change as quickly. I think we're very confident that the advertising we have or the communication we have is driving different categories. Then if you look at the overall, there's many, how would I say, noise overlaying it. We talked about laundry and the promotional effect overlaying the noise or we talked about TROJAN, that shift in channels is actually overlaying the true brand performance. So we look at it holistically across all the channels we have.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: A follow-up, Kevin. Another one?
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: I'm sorry?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Another one.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Sorry, Matt. Just a follow-up as, just to stick with online for a second, maybe talk a little bit about some of the opportunities, and maybe some of the risks you've seen in other categories whether it's – like blades, wet shave, some personal care categories like beauty where sort of have been demonstrated that the barriers to entry are a bit lower and there's been some risk to the incumbents. So, talk about how you guys are sort of looking at that. Britta, if you could chime in too particularly like in contraceptives as an example, to some of these categories that lend themselves a bit more to online? Thanks.
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Sure. So I would say categories are very, very different, so lower barriers to entry in beauty for example and cosmetics, yeah, or in skin care, if you look at our categories like condoms needs trust, yes, so we've seen across the world plenty of small condom pop-ups, right. None of them has stuck really anywhere in the world, because this is a category where long-term trust in the brand is absolutely essential. Other categories I would talk about, it's a huge opportunity for us actually online because there are categories where you don't really feel comfortable if you go in the store and purchase them. So, we have a brand, for example, Replens/RepHresh, yeah. You don't really want to be seen with a basket and saying I have personal odor. So, these categories were doing extremely well online, so I think the hard one is you have to differentiate on online very closely, think about what the consumer wants and what they're looking for. So, I personally see it as a huge opportunity for us. I'm not really worried. I don't see it as a threat or disruptive.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Joe?
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. First question I guess in terms of this move from tracked and non-tracked channels, what's the margin delta between your businesses in those two different channels. And then, secondly, on the acquisitions, it looks like you're paying roughly 4 times trailing revenue, call it 14 times EBITDA. For businesses that are in smaller categories, what's the goal there, is it geographic expansion for those two acquisitions you announced this morning?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. So, when we look at online contribution versus bricks-and-mortar contribution, we're looking at the basket, because some are actually going to have better margins online, some are going to have worse. But in total portfolio, they're about equivalent. We're not seeing an erosion from our online business. Your other question was on multiples?
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. It looks like you paid a pretty hefty multiple for some of these acquisitions, I'm curious what the growth opportunity is.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes, so we spent $290 million on those two. I'd tell you, what we paid was a little sub-12 and we think synergies is sub-10. So we think it's still a great deal whether it's international, domestic, wherever it would be. And I think – by the way, we also get some more scale for some key countries internationally, but I'd say it met all of our financial criteria.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Jason?
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, I have two questions. One, just on international. Obviously, years ago really didn't get that much of a discussion, now we talk a little bit more about it. So you're talking about some of the investments you're making there, maybe just to dovetail on Joe's question just about the acquisitions there, how should we be thinking, what percentage of sales if you think 5 years, 10 years down the road, will international be part of the story? And then the second question, I guess, so really wanted to talk about the gross margin guidance and the promotional and the commodity, maybe if you can flesh that out a little bit. The comfort level that you have in case the promotional environment does get worse, 60 basis points does seem a lot for a CPG company just in this environment. So I'm just, I know you lean on the productivity, but can you just maybe put a little more color behind that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, well. We have the good fortune of having the head of our international business with this here today, so I'm going to let Steve take a swing at your question.
Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you. So at Church & Dwight, we really haven't focused that intently in international expansion. Several years ago when Matt asked me to come in, I really viewed international as a wonderful opportunity to be a growth engine, just another piece of our growth strategy long-term. So we do feel that international represents a significant growth opportunity for us, we're making investments and Matt alluded to two new sales and marketing offices that we just opened this year, one in Panama to service Latin America and one in Singapore to service Southeast Asia, both of which are very dramatic growth opportunities for the company. So, we'll continue to make acquisitions and investments in terms of driving growth behind the brands that we exist both domestically and internationally. So, we see this continue to play out as a source of growth, incremental growth for the company. Where do we see it going long-term, you want my answer or Matt's answer? But I would say that we would – we think that as you look at CPG across the world that we would see this playing out to be a much more significant part of our overall portfolio than it has in the past.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. So where we have that earlier slide on international, they remember me saying that we're doing what a lot of the CPG companies did decades ago. During the last couple of years, we said, hey, we have to get after international. We have really good brands. We have some brands that can travel. Not all, but some can and Steve and his squad were doing a great job. But we're going to have above average, so just think about our model, 3% organic growth, above-average organic growth from international for years to come. That's going to help us, total company. And the ambition, we're a $500 million business today. What's our ambition? Our ambition is to be a $1 billion business. Will I be in a nursing home when that happens, maybe not, but that's not – that's organic and acquisitions, right. So, we've done acquisitions in the past. We did BATISTE a few years ago in 2011, listed these J&J brands and we're always on the hunt for other brands, but we're not slaves to our numbers. I'm not going to say, hey, we want to be $1 billion by this year. Not going to happen, but we do have high expectations of the business.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And then on the gross margin question, right. I'll just reiterate what I said. So, we're getting 40 basis points from acquisitions, great. It's been offset by commodities and promotional spending in FX and then we're getting the balance of it through litters in volume and productivity. To your early estimate of that 40 basis points, are we comfortable with that 40 basis points? Well, I'm not going to break out the 40 basis points in any more detail. I'll just tell you that it assumes double-digit increases in our surfactants. It assumes a mid single-digit increase in our resin. So we have commodity inflation built-in, since 20%-plus increases on diesel, right. I mean, so we have expectations and if it's more than that then we'll do what we need to do to help offset that and whether it's productivity program stepping on that or whether it's SG&A, whatever it is, we always have a whole array of levers that we pull if things don't go as expected.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Caroline?
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you. I have to follow tradition and ask two questions. Could you dive into the leaning on online margins because I thought it was really fascinating, most companies are up, they're saying they make more online?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: In some categories.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: But they, you start to wonder if you factor in all the investments in digital and the human resources you have to apply them in, I just want to understand a little bit more about that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. There's some truth in the fact that digital advertising is more efficient. We went through that example with litter. So instead of bombing away with TV advertising, you get to affect, to reach everybody. You're only going after the cat owners, so there are efficiencies in the advertising side, and – remember, that's going to be 12% of your sales. So you can be more efficient there, if I'm just going to improve your margins. Heavy things don't travel well. So when you think about online, so heavy things like a laundry detergent, litter, those are categories where you're going to be more challenged to have the same margins as you have in store, but then if you have some personal care brands on the other side, you're going to make more money than you do in retail. It is a balance.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Right. So net-net, our online margins are at or above company average because of the personal care mix, right. So that's – we've said that the last few quarters and that's still the truth.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. And then the other one is just how do you get the operating leverage that you look for when you buy overseas because you just don't have the scale you have here, not that you're the biggest company here, but in a way opening the offices in Singapore, and so how do you also get margin expansion while you're doing that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: When you acquire a business, you mean? Well, when you acquire, the interesting thing about acquiring a business is you're buying marketing contribution. So essentially it's gross profit minus marketing. So we don't add a whole lot of SG&A when you're buying a business. So, right off the bat if you can get leverage on what you bought, you're going to improve the operating margins of the business, so. It's something that – all this SG&A doesn't come with it when we acquire a business. So we have to acquire smart, so you have to buy where you have some infrastructure in different countries, particularly internationally. So that limits us a little bit more. It's hard for us to buy a business in a country we're not in and not bringing the SG&A. And then some of the math starts to fall down because we're oriented towards cash, how much cash the business throws off. I hope that helps you.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And the only thing is what Matt told you before, that small ANUSOL deal for example 80%, 90% of those volumes are going through Canada, we have sub Europe, right and Australia. So we feel like we do have a platform to leverage there. Those headquarters are really the jumping off point for regions, right. That's just a few SG&A heads and that's really the jumping off point for future expansion.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. How are you?
Unknown Speaker: Just sticking with international, I was still curious about the portfolio cohesiveness question, right. You talked about the financial attributes and I know that even domestically, right, the business has its chunks of businesses that don't necessarily have the most traditional strategic cohesion across the board and you've done wonderfully well with that. But you did it in one country, right? So to try to build an international business which is whatever it is, six or seven countries with a sort of feeling a little bit scattershot brand portfolio. I'm just curious if strategic fit is part of it beyond the financial attributes and the ability to leverage your infrastructure and so on? Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. That sounds like an indictment, so I think, Steve is ready for that beach ball.
Steven P. Cugine - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Sure, not a problem. It's a great question. Many of these international subsidiaries, the countries that Matt puts on the chart were acquired, right. When we did other acquisitions, Carter-Wallace has been the primary one and it had some cats and dogs for sure. So, three years ago, what we decided to do is to make this an engine of growth. We had to have a strategy. Both what markets, what brands, what capabilities and where from an acquisition standpoint we would like to go. So, what we did is we identified key brands that we knew we could grow in international markets, right? That's one. Two is, we have a North America focus, so we take the capabilities that the U.S. has and we extend them north, Canada, south into Mexico, so you saw Mexico, fabulous performance. We expect that to continue to grow, the biggest brand growing the fastest is our ARM & HAMMER franchise, so we feel like we have a long runway and we can continue to extend that further south through Latin America and the new sales and marketing offices will be a jumping-off point for that. Around the world is mostly a personal care business, so it's our personal care brands that we've been able to really ignite in many parts around the world. BATISTE, fast-growing in every market that we launched in, right. STERIMAR, so we sell STERIMAR in 87 countries around the world. It's a unique phenomena that doesn't really exist in the United States, it's this concept of nasal hygiene. So we look at countries like China as a great opportunity to leverage our capability, all the clinicals that we do in this space into emerging markets and they've really taken hold. So, one of our most successful markets for STERIMAR is in Mexico City for those same reasons. So we're exporting that same technology, talent, and capability in markets where we believe we have a right to compete and win. Femfresh is another category that is growing quite nicely for us. So we really selected down for international markets, key brands that we know where we have a competitive advantage and a right to win and then we're deploying our capabilities in markets, so then we select countries that we want to win in and that's been the magic of success, really driving significant growth. Last year, we did over 8% organic growth. This year, we're doing 10%, really based on that very strategic model.
Unknown Speaker: That's great. That's really helpful. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Olivia?
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. First question on laundry, we didn't really talk a lot about liquid laundry detergent, it's been a while since we've seen something in terms of innovation there and it's still a much larger category than unit dose despite the growth there. So I was just wondering if you can give it a little bit more color on that? And then back to international, clearly the growth has been phenomenal there, but for 2017, you're looking for growth about half the level what you achieved in 2016. So can you sort of bridge that gap a little bit, realizing that of course it's tough to expect double-digit growth in perpetuity? Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. The liquid laundry category, you're right. There isn't a lot of innovation in liquid laundry, so it's more of a brand story and brand equity, so all the growth has been driven by unit dose over time. I think that's going to continue in the future, so it's – no expectation, there was an expectation actually at one point there'll be further compaction in liquid laundry that clearly is not obvious today. Once upon a time, it was believed in 2017, liquid laundry will be compacted again because Wal-Mart announced that years ago. That is not on the radar screen right now. So, with respect to liquid laundry, it's more of a brand story. I'll ask Britta or Lou, if they want to add anything on liquid laundry detergent? You want to add to that?
Louis H. Tursi - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: The only thing that I would add to that would be that over the years, we have launched a lot in laundry detergent, and some of those sub-segments have done better than others. And so, there's distribution opportunities on some of those that we still haven't capitalized on, as we launched a different flavor or in the free category sensitive, that's what I mean, so we have opportunity in the sensitive category as an example. So, we are looking to expand our distribution in some of the great items that we've launched in the past that haven't capitalized on all the distribution opportunities.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, what's the second question you had, that was a two-parter?
Louis H. Tursi - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I would love to commit to 10% or double-digit growth from here into infinity. But I think what we see is some of our core markets, like developed markets in Europe which had a fabulous year last year, we don't expect that to continue long-term, we expect that to moderate to kind of the company average growth. Last year, they really over-delivered. Same thing with Canada with a great performance last year, we don't expect that long-term to continue. But we do expect the 4% to 5% at a minimum. We have higher expectations for ourselves in international markets, but I think we do see developed markets slowing down from their high point last year.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Steve?
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: I'm actually going to build on both of those questions. On the laundry side, your main competitors are – speaking of branding and marketing, are branding a lot right now, right. Both of them in the Super Bowl with various properties. So it sounds like you're going to go to market in liquid with basically your current portfolio, is that a big area of focus for stepped-up marketing next year or – is – what's the strategy in liquid as your competitors do a lot?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. There's no way we would – we'd go through our laundry strategy today for 2017. Is that what you're asking?
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: So, I guess, yes. There's no real incremental news that you're....
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Maybe I can help.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah.
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Maybe I can help a little bit. So, first of all, Super Bowl, I think – I want to be very clear, I think it's a great PR for most of them, but value. We are value-driven. We are very clear now on our metrics where we invest, and where we don't invest. So I think that's my number one to say about Super Bowl ads, right. We all enjoy watching them, but if you think about it you want to reach consumers at affordable cost, they're not the greatest. Secondly, I want to say, laundry, I mean, strip out a little bit of the noise, how much innovation has really been in liquid laundry over the last couple of years. You get a new flavor and a new flavor gets promoted and then it drops off again. And that's true for many of our competitors and I think we're making a decision to be much more clear that this is the area where consumers are not looking for something new every single time. They want good great performing products at a great value and that's what we are driving, what we have been driving. And just to come back to our shares, I think that's the secret formula of ARM & HAMMER and we've proven even in 2016 with all that kind of laundry battle going on, that ARM & HAMMER was a big winner. So, I think that's just to put it in context and distract a little bit of the noise around.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Fair enough. And then on international, just trying to get a sense of it sounds like, it feels like it's an increased priority. When it comes to M&A, is the financial bar higher or lower internationally versus domestic?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. it's not lower. The financial bar is universal, whether it's international or domestic and the businesses we just bought have cleared those hurdles.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: So, there's no relaxation on our standards.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Jason?
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for the question and congratulations again on a strong finish to the year. A couple of quick questions. First, kind of housekeeping on the stock options accounting change. If you look at your 10-K filing for last year, it would have been around a $0.14 benefit, the year before $0.06, the year before $0.07, why only $0.03 benefit as we look into next year and I guess what I'm getting is, is there a degree of conservatism embedded in that?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'd probably answer that a couple of different ways. So, quantitatively, you're right. It's a bigger benefit if you take 2016, our math has a dime, $0.10 if it was 2016. If you take the five-year average, it's a nickel. If we take Q4, annualize it, zero, right? So, it all depends on how the stock price moves and it's kind of a circular relationship. So, you can't have a low target price and high expectations stock option exercises, right? It just doesn't work in the modeling. So, that's on the stock option exercises. So net-net, $0.03, about $1.8 million of stock option exercises is our expectation. That could change, right? And we've seen our peer group, a lot of volatility, you guys see it even more than I do, right, people have raised and lowered multiple times already on this new accounting standard and so we're trying to take the noise out of it and if – hey, if it's worth it we're going to – we'll raise the number, we're going to be really clear about it.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate the visibility. Let's talk – go back to a question where we don't have the visibility and that's back to the unmeasured channel performance. It's hard, it's difficult since we can't see it, feel it, touch it and we're used to seeing, feeling and touching the performance. It's also hard because if we look at your performance and we compare it to what we can see, the spread, the delta is quite volatile. We have a really wide gap this quarter, a pretty narrow gap the quarter before. Implicitly you're guiding to a fairly narrow gap in the next quarter. I guess, we'll see how consumption comes out but what we've seen so far suggests a pretty narrow gap. Can you give us a little more color in terms of what drives the volatility quarter-to-quarter, why that isn't sort of a steadier state magnitude of relative outperformance? And maybe if there were some real lumpy volatility from last year, you can give us some color just so we hopefully can anticipate it coming?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, some of it can be distribution, the timing of distribution from year-over-year. Let's say you're right about online, it should be pretty steady if you have X sales online in one quarter it should be that or more in the next quarter. But, yeah, I think there's definitely going to be some distribution and portfolio mix year-over-year, but it's something we struggle with too, it's hard to forecast actually.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: I would say the same thing, it's a little lumpy for us too, so we tried to give you guys the best all-in algorithm that we can and sometimes we are under and sometimes we are over, but visibility is still tough.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: There's something else you should be aware of too, you can be online on, say, Amazon with plenty of products this month and next month, you're not. So you can get in and out because of their algorithms and how much you're selling online, et cetera, and that does create some wide fluctuations within a quarter and sometimes quarter-to-quarter. I'm sure you've heard that.
Britta Bomhard - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Maybe I can help with one little one. So how many of you took a New Year's resolution? We had a big campaign, New Year, New Me on vitamins, which is, we are the number one brand on Amazon online. So these kinds of effects and how successful one of these campaigns is going to be as we are all learning about online is hard to predict. So I would say that's also to invisible parts, these accelerating factors, which is certain categories perform well, certain timing of the year perform well. So that's for example, why the gap in Q4 where we shipped for that New Year, New Me was already, not visible to you guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Right here.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks. I have a general question on pricing and your ability and willingness to pull the pricing lever in 2017 especially given the heightened competitive environment. That would be first. And then second, your price mix internationally during the quarter deteriorated sequentially. So if you could touch on that as well as in terms of your ability to do it internationally, thinking about rising or increasing FX headwinds?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: When you say the price lever in 2017, you're saying our ability to raise price? Yeah. Okay, well, as far as raising prices goes, typically the categories you may be able to do that are categories where you're most dominant. So, say, baking soda, you have a 75%-plus share. Condoms, you have a 75%-plus share. But if you don't have that kind of leverage it's more difficult, number one. Number two is you need to have the support of the commodity cost rising. So, there are a lot of retailers, we will be able to pull the lever if you can support it with input costs which of course we have, but it remains to be seen if we can pass that on in 2017. A lot of retailers are very reluctant to take price as you probably know. What's your second part of your question?
Unknown Speaker: Just the same concept internationally, because in the fourth quarter price mix deteriorated sequentially, so just thinking about it internationally as well as you think about your mix?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: If anything it's probably just mix rather than in terms of country, right. If Canada's doing better, it's more of a household-type product, that's probably more than anything. I wouldn't read into it.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Anybody else before we wrap it up here?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks you all for coming today. Thanks for joining online, as I said super fourth quarter and optimistic about 2017. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for the call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Also please limit during the Q&A, your questions to one initial and one follow-up. Sir, please go ahead.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for today. I'll provide some color on the quarter and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker. When Rick is finished, we'll open the call up for questions. The Q3 was a solid quarter for our company. EPS exceeded our outlook, organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our August outlook of 1% to 2%. We would have been at the high end of the range if not for a far worse than expected result in our animal nutrition business which was an unexpected 70 basis points drag on the outlook. The quality of earnings was high this quarter. We expanded gross margin, we invested in higher marketing of 50 bps and SG&A was lower year-over-year. We overcame a high tax rate, a small product recall, and a big decline in our animal nutrition business and still beat our EPS outlook by $0.01. Our Consumer business delivered volume-driven organic sales growth of 2.5%, led by continued strong growth by our international Consumer business. In the U.S., our organic sales growth met our expectations, reflecting higher couponing as we communicated back in August. The good news is category growth was broad-based. Ten of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. Now, I'm going to say a few words about four of our categories. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 4% year-over-year, and our laundry business grew with the category. This is the sixth quarter in a row of laundry category growth driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments. In liquid laundry detergent, this quarter marked the 27th consecutive quarter of share growth for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry. In contrast, our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter, as we continued to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q2, we expect XTRA net profits to increase year-over-year for full-year 2016, and we have plans to turn around that brand. Also in the liquid category, OXICLEAN grew share to 1.8%, driven by strong promotional support. As we have said before, we are committed to OXICLEAN laundry detergent. We are encouraged by the trial activity in this most recent quarter, and our repeat rate continues to improve. Turning to the unit dose segment, our unit dose products continued to gain traction and had some of the largest gains in the category. For the second consecutive quarter ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. And our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Most important, our unit dose business was equally driven by base and promoted volume, signaling a healthy balance. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 50 basis points to 3.2% share in the quarter. Similarly, OXICLEAN unit dose also grew share in the quarter and is now a 1.1% share. These are encouraging signs as we continue to go in the right direction. Finally in fabric care, the stain fighter category grew 3.2%. OXICLEAN grew consumption 7% and is the leading stain fighter in the additive category with a 48% share. OXICLEAN grew share 170 basis points in the quarter. The litter category continues to be very competitive with increased couponing. For the quarter, the litter category was up 3.7%, while our brands were flat in measured channels. Our shipments were up as our online litter business more than doubled. Long-term we have won in this category through innovation, which continues to be our focus. Now we'll talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3.8%. The gummy segment of VMS grew 10% in Q3, which includes both adult gummies up 14% and children's gummies down 5%. Our adult brand VITAFUSION had another good quarter, growing consumption 9.7% with the success of our new products. L'IL CRITTERS children's gummy had a great quarter and grew consumption 6.6% compared to a 5% decline in the category. This is the second consecutive quarter that we have outpaced the children's gummy category. Today the gummy form of the entire adult VMS category is 10%. It was 3% when we bought the business four years ago. VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS are the number one brands, with shares of 28% and 30% in measured channels respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. The last category I'll address is dry shampoo. This category grew almost 27% in Q3 after growing 26% in Q1 and 28% in Q2. The category in the U.S. is now over $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we match the historical category growth experienced in the UK where the product originated. BATISTE is the number one brand in the U.S. with a 23.6% share. The BATISTE brand is expected to be one of the fastest-growing brands in the future for us. Now I'm going to talk about International. Our International Consumer business has emerged as a growth driver for Church & Dwight. After growing 3% to 4% annually from 2011 to 2014, our International business grew 8% in 2015 and is expected to hit 9% in 2016. BATISTE is only part of the story. Many brands have contributed to the success story. We have enjoyed stellar growth in Europe, Canada, and Mexico this year, while our export business continues to open new doors for our brands. We look forward to steady, strong growth from the International business in the future. Our Q3 total company organic growth was held back by significantly lower volume in our animal nutrition business, which reflects depressed milk prices. When we began the year we expected full-year growth from this business to be 1% to 3%, and now we're expecting a 9% decline on a full-year basis. That is quite a reversal. Thanks to the strength of our Consumer business, we expect to deliver 8% EPS growth and 3% organic growth for full-year 2016. We said we're early in our 2017 planning process; we'll say more about that in February, but for now we again expect high-single digit EPS growth next year. Next up is Rick to give you details about third quarter results, the outlook for Q4 and the full-year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share, compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million, organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our 1% to 2% range, but at the lower end, dragged down by the 70 basis point hit from our SPD business. When we spoke to you in August, we assumed a 3% decline in that business versus the 11% decline we experienced. Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 0.8% in the quarter. Volume growth was solid at 2.1%, offset by 1.3% drag from pricing. Now we expected approximately 1% organic for that business as we had anticipated the incremental couponing to support our new products and Q4 promotional shifts. As mentioned, we were a little below 1%, as we also got hit with returns due to a small product recall from our Orajel business. I know you guys are a fan of stacked numbers. So I wanted to call out our volume results for Q3. Of the 3.5% stack organic, all of it is volume. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect organic sales to be 2.5% for the Domestic business. That translates to maintaining our full-year organic sales outlook of 3%. Consumer International organic growth was up an impressive 12.1%. BATISTE continues to build depth of distribution in many countries, OXICLEAN and ARM & HAMMER continue to expand in North America and TROJAN continues to do well in Latin America. We're raising our expectation for the full-year organic growth from 7% to approximately 9% for the International business. To recap, 3% for the Consumer Domestic business for the full-year and 9% for the Consumer International business equates to 4% full-year growth for the global Consumer business and we are really pleased with that result. For our SPD division, organic sales were down 11.5%. Milk prices continue to be low due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong dollar. As said in the past, we like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time. On the bright side, the industry does forecast a slight improvement in milk prices in 2017. Turning now to gross margin, our reported third-quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 60 basis point increase from year ago, primarily due to lower commodities in our productivity programs. Q3 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 40 basis points, productivity programs and lower manufacturing costs worth 60 basis points. We also had 30 basis points from higher margin acquired business and going the other way we had a drag of 50 basis points from price/volume mix, as we had the higher promotional investments, largely the couponing we discussed earlier, plus we had a 20 basis point drag from currency. Now moving to marketing, we increased marketing spend by 5.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 50 basis points to 11.3%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.6%, a 30 basis point decrease from the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the timing of R&D spend and lower litigation costs. Now on to operating margin, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.5%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year, and the other good news is as a proxy for cash earnings, our EBITDA margin was up to 26% in the quarter. Next income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 35.6% and we continue to expect our full-year rate to be 35%. Turning to cash, we had a really strong cash flow quarter. On a year-to-date basis we have generated $495 million of cash from operations, an $86 million increase from the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital. So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include a strong consumer organic growth rate of 2.5%, increased gross margin expansion as we exceeded our outlook by $0.01, even after absorbing a hit from the SPD revenue decline and a small product recall. Turning now to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. The Consumer business is expected to pick up steam in the fourth quarter at 2.5% organic growth while we expect the dairy business to be down 13% and a drag on the total company organic sales growth. We expect fourth-quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.42, compared to $0.41 a share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year. For context, the significant year-over-year decline in SPD revenues equates to $0.01 drag to the EPS line. And we also have a higher tax rate that equates to about $0.01. You may recall the Q4 2015 tax rate had the full-year R&D credit all in one quarter. Turning to the full-year, we now expect organic sales growth to be at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, which reflects the previously discussed headwind from our Specialty Products Division. We continue to expect gross margin expansion of 110 basis points due to continued lower commodity costs and greater distribution efficiencies. And we also continue to expect 60 basis points of full year operating margin expansion and to deliver 8% EPS growth. Finally, we now expect $650 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $600 million of free cash flow, which represents over 125% free cash flow conversion. Now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Jason.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hi, Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hope all is well. A quick question on margins, I know we usually have to wait for the Q on this, but can you give us some of the color in terms of the gross margin bridge, the puts and takes that drove the increase this quarter?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes, sure. I tried to do that in my script the last few quarters. But continued improvement from commodities was worth 40 basis points. Productivity, manufacturing improvements was worth 60 basis points. Negative price/volume mix was a drag of 50 basis points, and that's largely the couponing that we talked about – and that's for the whole company. Acquisitions was worth 30 basis points higher margin businesses and then a drag of 20 basis points for FX. Now, as you know, the commodity benefit will start to continue to go down and that's in our expectations for Q4. For example, commodities by itself, Q1 was a benefit of 120 basis points, Q2 70 basis points, Q3 40 basis points and we expect 10 basis points in Q4.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. I know we're not going to get into a lot of detail on 2017 yet, but you did put some numbers out there this morning, and in there you talk about ongoing progression in gross margins expected for next year. What are some of the puts and takes that give you confidence in your ability to get there, given that as you just pointed out, the commodity tailwind should be dissipating?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, I think you're exactly right. In general for commodities next year we think it's pretty benign with the exception of surfactants which is going to be up we believe in 2017, but remember, we have our evergreen productivity program and that's really the driver behind gross margin expansion all the time and sometimes that's masked by the commodity impact.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful, guys. I'll pass it on.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, Jason.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Matt, I wanted to start on the SPD business, and I guess given what milk prices did there a disappointing result, does a quarter like this give you any pause with respect to the fit in the portfolio. I think your commentary in the past has been around a relatively comparable margin profile, somewhat attractive return on operating asset kind of business, but I guess the rebuttal would be it seems to be non-core and arguably a distraction. If investors wanted exposure to dairy prices, they could do so by investing in other assets. And I guess more fundamentally, a concern could potentially be that from one quarter to the next you could be in a position where you're faced with pulling back on investment behind a mega brand as milk prices tank in order to hit the guide on the quarter. So if you can revisit I guess some thoughts there and whether a quarter like this gives you any pause that'd be helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, Kevin. That's a good question. I'm sure a lot of people would question their hearts because the business had such a falling off of this quarter versus even our expectations when we spoke to everybody in August. But we do take the long view on this business, so we don't look at it as simply a – the dairy business that it is today, and it is one-dimensional. It's largely doing business in the U.S. and largely in dairy, but we've changed the focus of that business from simply dairy to animal productivity and what we did was we bought this business a year and a half ago called Vi-COR, early 2015. And what that did was that got us into poultry, swine and cattle, and also some international products. So it got us exposure to other species. So we want to even out the cycles over time by growing into other species and also with more acquisitions. So you might say well, if I want to invest in an animal productivity business, I can go to Zoetis or one of these other companies. And I would say, look, this is an asset light business. We have the good fortune of the legacy business of this company, which is sodium bicarbonate, having morphed out of that into animal productivity. And we have a lot of science in that part of the company, which is probably not well understood, PhD chemists, veterinarians, et cetera. So we have a great nucleus of people to build upon. And because it's asset light, because you know we're a cash driven company, has all the characteristics we want to grow over time. And the big macro is you got 7 billion people today, going to 9 billion in 2050. So it's a long answer, but it probably deserves a long answer considering the fact that it influenced the numbers this quarter. Now, looking ahead to 2017, the good news is the milk prices are forecasted to start recovering next year, so it's not going to be as bad next year as this year, so we would expect some growth out of the Specialty Products business in 2017. But it's certainly a legitimate question, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks, Matt. And a follow up here, the Consumer organic sales guidance for 4Q, if I'm not mistaken, is 2.5%, and even – so when I take a look at the comps, that still implies some slowing in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that. The Personal Care number was a little bit weak in the third quarter. I don't know if there is an expectation that persists, and then what exactly is driving that dynamic. Is there more couponing and heavier trade spend given what's going on in laundry right now, where that's ramped. So just if you could help sort of help me understand a bit what's driving the two-year average slowdown into the fourth quarter as well. Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Sure, Kevin. It's Rick. Now remember, a couple things here. We had a great VMS second half in 2015. We had recovered in a big way from all the cuts we experienced in the back half of 2014 and early 2015. So the back half was like 5.5% growth, for example, and the first half was flat. So to some degree, the comps were influenced by – the slowdown was influenced by that. That's number one. Number two, we do have some incremental couponing to drive trial. That was largely a Q3 event, but we do have a little bit in Q4. And in general, Q4 going to 2.5% organic is a predominantly volume driven result. And there's a little bit of price mix in there too, but Personal Care growth, which was a little bit negative in Q3, is expected to recover and be slightly positive in Q4 as well. So hope that helps. That's a little bit more color.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: A couple things. What's the endgame with all this cat litter promotional activity, because it's not like a super high return category. I'm just not sure why – it seems like a zero-sum. So like why do you think the activity is so pronounced now and how long do you think it will last, and maybe you think it abates a little bit as commodities start to firm or even rise a little bit going forward?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Bill, it's a good question. We've been on the sidelines with respect to the amount sold on deal. So we're not the offender, but there's been a tremendous amount of couponing by the other two players in litter. And obviously, they're promoting some of the new products that they have. But for our part, shipments were up in the quarter, and our new product, which is MICROGUARD, is the second highest repeat rate in litter only behind the original CLUMP & SEAL. So Nestlé, which is Tidy Cat, they're the big winner this past quarter, and we lost some share. So our view is that when we have innovation -- and you know us, we always do have something coming -- that's the time to promote heavily. But we're not part of the war right now.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. So when you talk about the mix impact to the gross margin line, it wasn't necessarily in cat litter?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Well, look, cat litter was up for the quarter year-over-year sales-wise, and as we also said that we did pretty well in the online class of trade as well.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. And remember we said price/volume mix was a 50 basis point drag. That's predominately price in the quarter, predominantly couponing.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Mostly in the laundry...
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Mostly in the laundry.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: ...category. It's not in litter, that price hit.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got you. And then, just, it's kind of a new business you guys haven't really talked about, but this export business. I mean, is it as simple as that like you kind of load up like a 40-foot container and ship a bunch of products to some country where you don't have a discrete sales force, or am I missing...?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You obviously had a college job on the docks. Now look, we're doing what a lot of businesses did 20 years, 30 years ago. We have – it's not just export, it's the international team is extremely strong. We have a strong management team. Have some new general managers in a couple countries and we've been able to grow international through a combination of local brands and U.S. brands. In North America, ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN and TROJAN are doing really well in Canada and Mexico, even a more recent acquisition, remember those vaginal moisturizers we bought, REPHRESH and REPLENS doing well in Europe. But in export we've been adding people and resources in Central America and in Southeast Asia. That opens up a lot of new countries for us. And yeah, sure I mean, as far as the manner in which you ship, certainly we're shipping to distributors around the world, but we've got a terrific distributor network out there and that's one of the strengths of that business.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. And then one last quick one if I could sneak it in. Has there been any change in the industry about what Henkel is doing with All and to a lesser extent Wisk. I guess the planograms get set again in March for the category. I mean, are you hearing any rumblings there?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. Look, this is – the time of year is fall when you're doing all your line reviews and you're not going to really find out about planograms until Jan, Feb, March, in the spring. So that's still a jump ball.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just a follow-up on Bill Schmitz's. So if you're not – couponing is not really around litter, is it – and we're talking about new products that it is focused, is it primarily around pods? I mean is that the big focus?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. No. No. Yeah. No, here is the way to think about it when you think about laundry. So, liquid laundry detergent had the highest percentage sold on deal as a category, in the past two years and in Q3. We were significantly under that. So we have not ramped it up. We've had steady amount sold on deal for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry for the past couple of quarters. The same is true for unit dose. My remarks what I said, was that unit dose is growing and it's balanced between the on deal and base. So where the couponing is for us is in OXICLEAN. So OXICLEAN as you know, we launched a couple years ago. And then Persil came on the scene, then we went sideways for a while. So we've got to work a lot harder to get trial. And it's been working for us, but it's been costly. So the couponing that we're referring to is largely for OXICLEAN in laundry.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, Rick, on the gross margin bridge you walked through, where would I – I mean, both on kind of the easier comparisons from the vitamin start-up and then also, I assume there was a mix benefit from the decline in Specialty, that that would have actually helped gross margin. Is that right? And would that fall in – where would that fall in, in that bridge?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. You're exactly right, Bill, on both counts. Well, remember the VMS start-up expenses really did start to dissipate as we got into Q3 and Q4 a year ago. Those were predominantly even more help in Q2. And remember, we had 130 basis points in Q2 a year ago – last quarter, as a manufacturing benefit. This quarter it was only 60 basis points because we – those start-up expenses did dissipate a year ago. As far as mix for actual division mix? Yeah, you're right. The decline in SPD probably threw off around, I don't know, 10 basis points, 15 basis points, and that would be the mix line.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then last one for me. Matt, I guess, in two out of the past three years, I think, you've done ASRs for your shares, and just because cash was sitting on the sidelines and it was a good use of it. Why just this authorization today and then in kind of your initial guidance for next year of high single-digit EPS growth, is there an assumption of a lower share count or is that not factored in yet?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'll take that, Bill. Generally, we've done, in the past few years between $200 million to $400 million of share buyback. And our authorization – we only had about $130 million left. And so just typically this year as we do our planning cycle, we go to the board and say, hey, here's our refresh for our share authorization. In the last two years we've done $500 million. We're doing $500 million again. So that's kind of a consistent approach. It doesn't mean we're going to do $500 million. I will say that if – we will be selective when we – depending on what the share price is, to either ramp that up or ramp that that down. But we do have an assumption of share count in our plan and we'll go through that probably in February.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And ASRs are still possible?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: ASRs are possible. The 10b5-1s are also possible. It just depends.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Sounds good. Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Powers of UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hi, Steve.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. So just to go back again to Bill Schmitz's litter question and just carry forward the logic of your answer, you might not be the primary actor today. But if you've always got something new coming to promote behind, it would follow that you've probably got something new coming in cat litter. And therefore might that not be just the catalyst for the current battles to continue? Or is – I guess to Bill's question, is there something that breaks the cycle?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Steve, part of it is we believe innovation wins. At the end of the day the product sells itself. And so you have to do trial, you have to do everything else to promote your product and get it in the hands of consumers. But at the end of the day our belief in litter and that's why we didn't even exist in the 1990s in litter and we're up to the number two brand in litter today – is it's innovation. And so all this price competition is what it is and we're kind of holding our own. Sales are slightly up in the quarter despite all this amount sold on deal and couponing. But we believe innovation trumps all of that.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, fair enough. And I know the pressures that led to the lower guidance this quarter were really Specialty Products related. But just taking a step back and listening to the full slate of HPC companies that have reported so far, it seems like demand trends remain broadly challenged. Competitive pressures are rising and they are rising certainly more so in certain pockets. But broadly, they are rising. And deflationary benefits are turning into inflationary pressures as you look forward. And all together, that's not really a great combination. So I guess, I'd just love your perspective on that, again, broadly speaking. And then specific to your business, I think how those dynamics impact laundry is probably the most critical factor as you think about 2017. So if there's a way for you to focus your comments on how they are shaping your 2017 planning in that category specifically, that would be great as well.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Steve, this is probably a better question to ask first week of February because then we will be talking about what innovation we have by category for next year because as you know, the CPG business is a shelf space game. So the more shelf space, the more market share and you need innovation to bump the other guy off the shelf and take more share and get more facing. So it's an innovation story frankly, for 2017. And that's why we would have the confidence to say hey, we're going to hit our evergreen model again in 2017. Your larger question might be about the economy. And of course we see everything that you see. Unemployment is pretty steady but GDP is only 1.5% and gasoline prices creeping up, healthcare costs noticeably increasing for consumers and a median household income around $51,000. So that is the consumer. So obviously, that's hitting the consumer in the pocketbook. So it's – I wouldn't say it's the best outlook for the consumer. But from our point of view, we think that we have so many different ways to win here. We have – we've got 10 brands. We got a great International business. And Specialty Products has its ups and downs, but that will be back next year. So we sort of have a 12-cylinder engine. As we showed in this quarter, if some of them are misfiring, others will. And we are able to hit our numbers. So we aim to hit the numbers again next year, just as we did this year.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: And, Steve, just want to add to that is – Matt had the commentary. But laundry category up 4%, still strong; vitamin category, up 10%, great tailwind; BATISTE category up 20%. So there's a lot of good things happening despite in some other categories where there is more competitive pressure.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Okay, that's all fair. That's all fair. And I may have missed this, but did you call out any early indication on the stock option compensation accounting change and how that's going to impact your tax rate and earnings algorithm next year?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, we haven't done it yet. It's a pretty simple calculation but we'll probably do that next quarter, give you guys an outlook.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: On that specific piece of it.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: You got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to International, and looking at the hockey stick that you guys alluded to earlier beginning in 2015 and now 2016 in terms of organic growth, I'm trying to tease out – I don't know if there's a way to do it, how much of that growth is coming from sort of like-for-like same-store sales, and how much of that is coming from expanded distribution of certain brands?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: You talking about country by country now...?
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: No, no, just in general, just in general. Yeah, the 9% you're looking at today. How much of that is a like-for-like growth number?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. The predominant of that is like-for-like growth. We were in existing countries. We are doing depth of distribution for BATISTE. ARM & HAMMER is doing great in Canada and Mexico. So it's an existing – and it's in our existing footprint.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, Joe. It would be the export business that would be new doors, new shelves, new countries. That's the expanding piece of it.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So in terms of the impact on the P&L, what's the margin impact from that faster growth in International? What's the drag?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Why do you think there's a drag from that, Joe?
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I would just assume there would be a drag. I would assume your Consumer Domestic business would be a more profitable business. Is that a wrong assumption?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Right. Remember, as we are growing internationally, a lot of those sales, remember, are Personal Care in nature versus a Household in nature. So yeah, we have Household Products in Canada and Mexico. But export business is predominantly more like a BATISTE or a Femfresh, which is Personal Care margins. So you are right, it has a better distributor margin, so maybe at the net you have a lower number, but it's on par because it's PC brands.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, secondly, on laundry, you mentioned 4% category growth despite pretty significant couponing going on there. How much of that is coming from the base liquid business and how much of that is from unit dose and people using more product in the unit dose category?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: The unit dose is the bigger grower of the two versus...
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I'm just thinking – how much is the base of the business up?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, let me see if I have the liquid – talking about how much did the liquid category grow for example. Is that what you are asking?
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, exactly, because you have obviously seen a lot of companies talk about using two and three units per load, which is obviously driving volume growth.
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes, we think most of it is volume growth, Joe, but we'll have to circle back and give you the number specifically.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, no problem. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Caroline Levy of CLSA. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you and good morning. I noticed four of your 10 power brands had share gains. That seems to be a number that's coming down over time. And just wondering what gives you – or where would you expect that number to be a year from now? Obviously, the goal is 10 out of 10, but what do you believe you can change to make that a different number?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes, we've had four this quarter, four last quarter. And as you know, we are more transparent than other CPG companies in that we call out our brands and we give ourselves a report card and let our analysts and investors know as well. So the four that were up were, BATISTE, VMS, OXICLEAN and Nair. So you'd say, okay, what about the other six? So one was flat; that was ARM & HAMMER. So we had growth in laundry, but that was offset by litter. So if you said, is there one that you would expect to improve next year, yeah, it would be ARM & HAMMER. So four would become five. So then you say, what are the other ones? The other ones would be TROJAN. So TROJAN, we had lost some share in measured channels, but we have strong growth in untracked channels, and that will continue to be probably a bigger part of the discussion measuring brand growth in measured channels versus all-in, which is harder to get your arms around. XTRA is certainly one that we've been suffering because of deep competitive discounting. So have been more or less on the sidelines there. So that one, we expect to turn around and obviously, it's pretty obvious what that's going to take. Orajel, there has been some pressure from private-label but we have an improved product offering that's coming out in Q4 to distinguish ourselves again further from private label, so we hope that's going to have a positive impact. FIRST RESPONSE, the issue there is we have some retailers experimenting with the split between branded and private label. And SPINBRUSH last quarter, adult grew 10% and kids was soft. This quarter it's the reverse. Kids was way up and adult was soft. But the business grew, just not at the same pace as the category. So yeah, it's a mixed bag. If you said what would be a good score? Every quarter would be, we'd say six. If you can get six out of 10 every quarter that would be fantastic. I think stellar would be seven to eight. But nine to 10 is aspirational, Caroline.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Got it. Yes. Jumping to International, if you're guiding to 9% sales growth for the year, which I think you are, that would be a big slowdown in the fourth quarter, is there something there?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, Caroline. We've incorrectly called this for two or three quarters. We kept on thinking International would come back down to earth and be mid-single digits, and I think we just maybe called it a little too early, and so this is really just the reality. The business is a great business, it's, we think, going to grow mid-single digits for a long time. On the edges, Europe is slowing down a little bit and Australia as well. But in general, 5% – 4% or 5% in Q4 is still a solid growth number.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, and we should expect long-term that if we're calling 3% for the company that we would expect the International business to be higher than that year-after-year.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Got it. And then lastly, it's a little more detail, but you've said a lot about laundry, but I'm asking if you could tell us a little bit more about specifically what you think the acquisition of Sun might do, what you actually see, if you're seeing anything yet out of Procter, (39:10) are they stepping up their promotional activity. What's changing there?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. I can't take a swing at that one, Caroline. I wouldn't comment on what's going on with Henkel and Sun. I mean, they just closed the acquisition and – but I haven't seen anything different as far as discounting goes. They've been discounting heavily all year long, Purex and Sun. So, there's been no change to that since the acquisition.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay, Caroline.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, also I'd like to remind you to please keep your questions to one initial question and one follow-up. Our next question is from Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, some CPG companies have been talking about seeing some retailer destocking. I was just wondering is there anything that you've been seeing in any of your FDM customers at this point?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. I mean, you do hear that from time to time over the years. But I don't think that ever happens. I think the retailers are as focused on working capital as anybody else. So I think they run pretty tight ships. So it's unusual to have a situation where a retailer is overstocked and they're cutting back on their inventories.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then the last question. I know you mentioned TROJAN before. Just been seeing some of these articles out there talking about millennials don't like condoms. So I was just wondering how do you respond to that in terms of growing that business, and what are you seeing on your end?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Look, there is always going to be a certain percentage of the population that doesn't enjoy sex with a condom. But that's been a great business for a long period of time where we've got a 75% share. And being the big dog in the category, it's up to us to continue to promote safe sex and compliance.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's a good answer. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: All right. See you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. So, in Q4, you're looking for a 1% to 2% organic sales growth. So obviously implied in that guidance is a potential that there could be acceleration from Q3. So can you talk about what gives you confidence in seeing that potential acceleration, are there incremental programs going in place? Obviously, you've got a little bit of a stepdown in comps, but that didn't quite help that much in Q3. So can we talk through that first please?
Richard A. Dierker - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. It's a couple things. Number one, we don't have the tactical (41:54) couponing on OXICLEAN to the same degree that we did in Q3. We don't have the impact of the Orajel product returns/recall. On a positive note, our vitamin business and our laundry business has some promotions in Q4 that some of them were in Q3 a year ago. So we feel pretty good about the 2.5% that we called for the Consumer Domestic division. That's probably where your head is around
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Perfect. Thanks. And then just on the dry shampoo, you guys have talked a little bit about the $300 million opportunity if you can get to the UK level. So can you talk about the similarities you see between the two markets? And then how much of that growth that you've seen so far is new distribution versus the underlying strength within the category? And if it does continue to grow at these levels, what about the competitive threat from others entering the category and potentially chipping away at your share?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good questions. So here is the way to think about it. There are about 60 million people in the UK and in U.S. dollars the consumption of dry shampoo is about $60 million. So when we look the U.S., we say, hey, we've got 335 million people in the U.S. were we to have a similar use consumption in the U.S., you'd a $300 million category. So it is as simple as that. As far as where is the growth coming from, it's not simply – it is new distribution, but it's higher consumption. The category continues to grow and the good news for us is that the category is growing rapidly and our share keeps expanding. So our share expanded from Q2 to Q3 in a category that's growing rapidly. And what we have going for us is that, BATISTE is viewed as a European brand, number one. And number two, its efficacy is far better than anything else that's on the market. So it's really product performance is what's winning. So people who have not used our product and then switch to BATISTE, they don't go back. So it's – we're not concerned about other entrants. There are a lot of people in there already, Your Mother's, TRESemmé, et cetera. So there's plenty of big dogs in the category. So we certainly like our chances. We're number one dry shampoo globally not just in the U.S.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, and thanks for fitting me in. Most of my questions are answered. But one I wanted to ask on the M&A front. So clearly in the public markets we've seen some of the froth come out of consumer staples valuation. I was just curious, as you guys are looking out there, are you seeing better valuations, better opportunities out there in your M&A search?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yeah, that's a hard one to answer. I wouldn't say I can make any sweeping comment about multiples going up or down. As you know, we are an acquisitive company, so anything that is for sale in CPG, 99 out of 100 times we will get the book. But I wouldn't say that the market has peeled off or gotten any worse.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. And then going back to your Specialty Products division, clearly the dairy market challenges has been an issue weighing on that business are there any other competitive dynamics at play in terms of the weakness that you've been seeing?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No, that's good question. So it's not a function of losing share. It's entirely due to demand. The interesting thing about that business is that once a dairy farm starts using your products and particularly the ARM & HAMMER, so a lot of our products we sell under the ARM & HAMMER name and it creates a lot of weight that goes with that. So once you are with the producer, they are going to stick with you. So it's not switching or share, it's just purely demand.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Hey, Nik.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Just two quick questions. Hey, guys. Are you guys seeing any activity with the retailer kind of prompting more promotional activity on behalf of the suppliers, meaning kind of the, what I call the retailer reach back given some of the traffic issues they're dealing with in the face of the economy, and also e-commerce? That's the first question. And then the second question is just thinking about the International business. What's the vision and the strategy on that business. I mean, are you going to take kind of like a Clorox approach and just focus on a couple of countries or do you believe that you have some more white space opportunity to expand your footprint?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Yes. Let's take the International one first. So we have a business in Mexico and Brazil, so we'd like to go where the people are. So there's over 100 million people in Mexico and there's 200 million people in Brazil. So those would be a focus for us. And then there are countries we're not in, like Germany for example, which is the largest, strongest economy in Europe. So longer term we'd say, yes, that's a place we'd want to be in. And then export is one that is just a fountain for us because we have found that our products do travel well and we have built an export team. We have a great leadership there and we think the sky is the limit with respect to driving our product internationally. So I think that's sort of the view with respect to International, Nik. That's why we're so positive about it. Your front end question was are we seeing more asks on part of the retailers?
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, just generally speaking are you seeing more kind of promotional activity because the retailer is kind of pressing on the suppliers?
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: No. I would say no more than in the past. Our retailers, they are in a very competitive business, obviously but I wouldn't say there's any trend that we've experienced.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. Thanks, Matt.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Farrell for closing remarks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, everybody for joining us today, and we'll talk to you again in February.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Dierker. Rick will comment on each of our businesses and review the outlook for Q3 and the full year. And when Rick is finished, I'll get back on and we'll open the call up for questions. So here are the highlights; Q2 was a terrific quarter for our company. We posted organic sales growth of 3.7% and 16.4% EPS growth, which is 17.8% EPS growth on a currency neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based, in that nine of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective four of our 10 power brands grew share. Now I'll comment on a few of our categories; that would be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 2.5% year-over-year. This is the fifth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 4%, led by ARM & HAMMER, Simply Tide and Sun, mid and premium tier segments grew slower than the category. The Laundry category growth was driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments. Now I'll comment on our three laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 10 basis points. To illustrate the consistency of the brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 26 consecutive quarters. Our unit dose products are gaining traction. ARM & HAMMER unit dose in the quarter grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. Our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Growth was equally driven by base and promoted volume signaling a healthy balance. These are encouraging signs and we are really pleased with the results. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 40 basis points to a 3% share in the quarter. Our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter as we continue to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q1, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to increase year-over-year for full-year 2016. OXI laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity and increased distribution. As we have said before, we are committed to OXI laundry detergent and are in this for the long haul. As you know, Henkel has plans to acquire the Sun Products company, which owns all, Wisk and Snuggle brands and competes in private label. It's too early to know the impact on the category. There are two obvious schools of thought; we may experience a disciplined competitor who competes with innovation, or the laundry category could see even more discounting. We'll have to just wait and see. Regardless of what happens, we believe our brands are important to consumers. Consumer insights leading to the right products, at the right price point will be our formula for success. Moving on to stain fighters, OXICLEAN is the leading stain fighter in the additive category. This is the second consecutive quarter that OXICLEAN share hit a 48% share, growing 2% versus last year. Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment is healthy with consumption growth of 4.5%. Q2 saw a significant increase in the amount sold on deal by competitors, notably Clorox and Tidy Cat. At the same time, our amount sold on deal was significantly lower than the prior year, resulting in a pullback in share. In the end, innovation carries the day, we are very pleased with the performance of our new premium priced CLUMP & SEAL MICROGUARD. And while we're on the topic of innovation, I would like to acknowledge that ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL litter received the prestigious 2016 Nielsen Innovation Award for food and household products. CLUMP & SEAL was selected from a field of 3,500 new product launches over a two year period. Innovation is the key to long-term organic growth and we continue to focus on litter innovation. Now, let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew at 15% in Q2. Let me break that down for you, the adult gummy segment grew 21%, while the kids gummy segment declined 4%. So vitamins is a good news story for us. Both VITAFUSION and little L'il Critters grew in the quarter. VITAFUSION adult gummy consumption grew 9% and L'il Critters children's gummy also recorded positive growth of 40 basis points. Most notable, our combined points of distribution for our vitamin business grew 5% year-on-year, reflecting continued distribution gains. Our strong quarter was the result of new item introductions, expanded distribution of existing SKUs and the quality issues that we experienced last year are behind us. In adult and children's gummy vitamins category, VITAFUSION and L'il Critters are the number one brands, with shares of 31% and 32% respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. Remember when we bought the business, out of the entire adult VMS category, only 3% was in the gummy form. Today, it is 9%. The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 28% in Q2 after growing 26% in Q1. The category in the U.S. is now nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category, if we match the historical category growth experienced in the UK where the product originated. BATISTE is the number one brand in the U.S. with a 22.3% share. BATISTE was the fastest growing brand in the category and BATISTE original dry shampoo is now the fastest turning SKU in the category. BATISTE global net sales will cross $100 million this year for us, making it the number one dry shampoo brand globally and the BATISTE brand is expected to be one of our fastest-growing brands in the future. Next up is Rick to give you details of our second quarter results and the outlook for Q3 and the full year.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share, compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.85 is a penny or a 1.4% drag from currency year-over-year. Reported revenues were up 3.6% to $877 million, organic sales were 3.7%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. Our organic sales beat was driven by our Consumer business, both Domestic and International. This may surprise some of you who track our consumption reports every few weeks, the Nielsen and IRI numbers are a barometer of consumption growth, the difference is unmeasured channels. I want to remind everyone about our strength in club and the growing strength of our online business. For example, you read in the release that online sales for our vitamin business doubled. So third-party consumption reporting is directional but doesn't give the whole picture. Now, let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 4.4% driven by VITAFUSION Gummy Vitamins, Batiste Dry Shampoo, OXICLEAN additives and partially offset by KABOOM cleaners. We continue to expect full-year organic sales to be approximately 3% for the Domestic business. International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by higher sales in Australia, Mexico and Canada. We are raising our expectation for the full-year organic growth from approximately 5% to 6% to approximately 7% to 8% for the International business. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were down 7.7%. Milk prices are still relatively low as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been around 15% plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We are lowering our expectations for the full-year for the SPD division to be down 4% to 5%. We like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time. Turning now to gross margin, our reported second quarter gross margin was 46.5%, a 250 basis point increase from a year ago, which was quite a bit better than we originally expected, largely due to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies and higher Personal Care sales. Since we spent quite a bit of time last quarter on gross margin, I'd like to breakout the detail now for the quarter improvement versus year ago. I will do the same thing for our full-year gross margin outlook in a few minutes. Q2 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 70 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, which include the absence of vitamin startup cost, together is worth 130 basis points. Price volume mix is worth 60 basis points, as we had higher Personal Care organic sales, up almost 8% versus a year ago. And in general, we had a low level of promotion across the portfolio. Finally, we had 20 basis points from the higher margin acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. Moving to marketing, we increased marketing spend by 3.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 13.7%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.8%, an 80 basis point decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. Remember in 2015 we had a pension settlement charge of $8.9 million, so on an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 30 basis points, in line with our full year expectations. Now to operating profit, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 20%, which is 320 basis points higher than the prior year on a reported basis and 220 basis points better on an adjusted basis, largely driven by the gross margin improvement. Other expense was $6.8 million for the quarter. Next our income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%, we are raising our effective tax rate forecast for the full year to 35%, largely due to geographic mix. So there is a bigger drag from tax. Turning to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter. So on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $297 million of cash from operations, which is a $48 million increase from the same period a year ago. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic, 16.4% EPS growth, which again equate to a 17.8% currency neutral EPS growth. Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%, behind stronger promotions and slower growth for our International and SPD divisions. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales, as we begin to spend back our gross margin expansion. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.92, compared to $0.90 per share a year ago, or a 2% increase year-over-year, which reflects the step up in marketing, the higher promotional activities, slightly higher SG&A due to incentive comp and a higher tax rate. And now, turning to the full year. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be 3% to 4%, which has been increased from 3% when we started the year. We posted 4.4% organic growth in the first half. And in the second half, as we plan to spend back a bit more on promotional activities, it results in lower second half organic sales growth. We will likely end up in the middle of the range. In May, we called approximately 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. And we are pleased to say that we are raising our outlook to 110 basis points of expansion. We can attribute this increase to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies offset by incremental promotional activities. I'd like to break out the detail now for the full year gross margin outlook versus year ago. For the full year, gross margin benefits from lower commodities and that's worth 60 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs including the absence of vitamin startup costs is worth 50 basis points. Price volume mix is worth 10 basis points as we invest a bit more in higher promotions in the back half. And finally, we forecast 20 basis points from the higher margin acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. We are increasing our full year marketing expectation by 10 basis points to 12.4%, as we spend back some of the gross margin beat. Moving to SG&A, adjusting for the 2015 pension settlement charge, we are now forecasted to increase by 40 basis points. We had previously called 25 basis points for the increase. The higher SG&A rate is due to significantly higher medical cost and higher incentive comp. So now we expect 60 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year. Next is income tax. As I mentioned before, we now expect 35% for the full year, so it's about 30 basis points greater than our previous outlook. In terms of EPS, we dropped the low end of the range and are now targeting 8% to 9% of adjusted EPS growth, despite the incremental spending on marketing and promotion as well as the higher tax rate. We now expect $640 million of operating cash flow, which is $10 million better than our previous outlook of $630 million. We continue to expect $55 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $585 million of free cash flow, which represents 125%-plus of free cash flow conversion. Wrapping up, as you read in our earnings release today, we also announced a two-for-one stock split of our common stock. The split will increase our total shares outstanding from approximately 128.8 million to 257.6 million shares. Now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Matt, I wanted to start, or Rick as well for that matter, on the guidance. So, organic sales stays the same, gross margins a bit better. But, Matt, it seems like but – and then advertising and marketing moves up more modestly, so it seems like you're probably leaning a bit harder on trade spend and coupon with some of this gross margin upside relative to taking up advertising and marketing. Is that correct? I just wanted to get some additional thoughts on how you're sort of balancing the trade spend in advertising and marketing?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Matt and I can both answer that. But, Kevin, from a financial perspective, I'd say it's pretty broad based. We have higher promotional spending. Yes, we also have higher advertising. So, I think it's a combination. And, that's kind of the – again, broad-based across advertising and promotional spending.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Hey, Kevin, just to give you maybe a little more color. In my remarks, I said, hey, there's a lot of discounting going on in laundry and litter. And litter for example, we actually pulled back on trade promotions year-over-year in Q2 while at the same time, if you looked at Tidy Cat or Fresh Step they were up significantly in Q2. And even in laundry, the amount sold on deal for ARM & HAMMER was actually lower year-over-year in Q2, whereas if you looked at Tide, Simply Tide or Sun or especially Purex, are way up in the amount sold on deal year-over-year. So, every quarter is different. So you got to react to what's going in the marketplace and as I said, we're – we want to stay behind OXICLEAN, OXICLEAN laundry so, we're in it for long-haul there. And here and there in some other categories there's some competitive moves that we need to react to. So, fortunately, we have the financial flexibility in order to do that and as you know, we got a big portfolio of brands. So, we're in a position where we need some help, we're going to put the help there.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. All right. That makes sense. Rick, I wanted to come back to, you touched on it a little bit, some of the non-scanned channel growth versus the scanned or tracked channel growth and so, you are up about 0.5 point in the Nielsen data for the second quarter. That implies very strong double-digit growth in non-tracked, just using sort of back of the napkin sort of math based on reasonable assumptions for channel mix. So, can you guys help me a bit, what is online now as a percent of sales and understanding that club is not in the Nielsen data as well, but curious what that number is, if you care to share it, what are your market shares look like online versus non-tracked? Procter talks about having higher market share in the online channel relative to more traditional mass channels. And then Matt, maybe touch on a little bit as this continues to evolve and the consumer continues to move online, talk about the implications a bit for your business from a – even broadly, margin perspective, seemingly less trade spend at this point et cetera? Thank you.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So, Kevin, just to touch briefly, we don't really go into the detail of our online sales. We've said historically, it's 1% to 3% of sales, just like any other CPG company, that's true, I'd say it's fast growing. From a market share perspective, we don't really comment on that either. What I will do for you though is help you with the tracked versus not-tracked and there is two or three drivers on that disconnect. For example, there's probably around 200 basis points from club and online, plus the fact that BATISTE isn't really tracked in Nielsen data from the reports you guys get. There is also a disconnect when you don't spend on promotion. So for example XTRA, consumption is down 6%, our net sales is essentially flat because we're not spending as deeper on promotion, same thing with Spinbrush, which we talked about before as well, we're up 10% consumption, net sales were up 15%. So when you're trying to bridge consumption all the way back to organic, those are a couple of the reasons why and I'll turn it back over to Matt for online.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, just broadly as Rick said, that most consumer products companies have sales between 1% and 3% online and online is actually not as clear as you might think in order to determine shares, because you got Amazon, walmart.com, target.com, there is lots of places where we want our product to be available and the whole game is, you want your product to be ubiquitous, right, it needs to be wherever a consumer wants to find it. So we're looking at this as just another class of trade. We have a convergence going on between research and advertising, right? So a lot of the research now, a lot of consumer behavior research is digital, it's online. At the same time a lot of the advertising is online. So we understand that, so we're weaving both our advertising and our research efforts together as a result. It's the early innings for everybody and everybody has got to look at do we have the right pack sizes for online. You're going to have different packs online than you have in the store just to take the weight out. We always look at change as our friend, because we're a small company. So we think that we can react to change a lot faster than other companies. So we're kind of looking forward to competing online.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the quarter.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Bill.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. The organic growth guidance for the third quarter, was there a timing shift in shipments at all or is it merely a function of higher promotional spending which is going to take the gross to net down? Because the comp's much easier in the third quarter than the second quarter obviously.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think it's a couple things. I mean, what you're getting to is also just deceleration from first half to second half. But the incremental promotional spending, right, that's one. We're up against higher comps for vitamin, like for example our Personal Care growth was up big in Q2, up 8% organically. And for vitamins we were cutting a year ago in Q2 and that kind of lessened as we got in the back half. And then, category comps for laundry for example are up a little bit in the back half, and then International growth, the first half was at 10% and the full year is at 7% to 8%. So that implies a second half of 4% to 5%. So all those reasons are why we're decelerating a little bit. But, I'd say that's – our original outlook was 3%, we always thought it would be, we raised that at the beginning of the year to 3% to 4%. And we always knew it was going to be a little bit lumpy.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, I mean, but how about the comps being harder in this quarter than they are for next quarter. I mean, because all that stuff is good, but like in aggregate the comp's like 200 basis points easier than the comp in the second quarter. You know what I mean?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Well, I mean, the other comment I'd make is the laundry category – going back to the category dynamics for a second, if you go back to 2015, the laundry category was actually down in Q1, right. And in 2016, the laundry category was up in Q1. So on a stacked basis that was around 5%. In Q2, it's around 4%. But then, when you look out, the laundry category actually had 2% to 3%, almost 4% growth in the back half of the year in 2015. So, part of it is, like I said before, Household comparisons for laundry and then Personal Care, really vitamins going from Q2 to the back half is a more difficult comp.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, just directionally, is it fair to think that like the Personal Care business has 20 gross margin points higher than the Household business. Is that a safe assumption, as I try to calculate the mix impact of the business shift?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We've said that publicly before. We said Personal Care margins are about 2000 basis points better than Household.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got you. And I'm kind of surprised that the mix benefit wasn't more though, given like the lower promotions in the lowest margin categories like XTRA and cat litter?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We were very pleased with 250 basis points of expansion.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, was I. Okay. That's all I got. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, just wanted to clarify. As I look forward, as you're spending back in some of these brands, has that always kind of been in the plan of hey, we just kind of get to midyear and look to redeploy in certain areas? And then specifically, is what you're seeing in liquid laundry in terms of the price competition or some of the rollbacks what you expected or has competition heated up a little bit?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: I don't know if it's – I'd say competition has heated up because the amount sold on deal. It's certainly higher than it was year-over-year. Sequentially it's probably consistent with the first quarter. The way we run the business, Bill, is we put a range out there, 7% to 9%. So we're pretty much targeting the midpoint of a range generally. We get a great first half, so we say, hey, we don't see our way to 7%. So we're going to say – so we're going to take the bottom in the range off so we'll call 8% to 9%. And we don't try to hit the home run in any one year. We're always thinking about the next year. So we want to make sure we're positioned well going into next year. So to the extent we have the dough, we're going to spend it back. And this has been a perennial move on the part of Church & Dwight.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: No. I appreciate that. I think I have a pretty decent handle on the trends. But I was trying to kind of more understand as you look to the back half, I understand the strategy of spending back. But, is there an incremental need to spend back in liquid laundry and/or cat litter versus what kind of you originally expected to start the year?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Because we – I would say that because we pulled back as a percentage of sales on deal for litter in the second quarter. Actually that's something we would try to remedy in the back half. Because obviously we lost some share there. But we – share can be a saw tooth, it can go up and down. But I will say that it's definitely competitive in litter. You have both Tidy Cat and Clorox spending a lot of dough promoting their products. So obviously we have to react to that. But laundry is our biggest category and that's one we're also have to react. XTRA continues to lose share, we're managing that for profit. But there is a line that we won't cross. So we have to make sure we shore that up in the second half.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then just switching, Rick, I think you talked about the Nielsen IRI doesn't track your stuff perfectly, I mean, I understand that especially coming from vitamins, which kind of were – the business was built out of club and mass, but can you talk about other wins or other kind of growth you're seeing outside of vitamins in the club channel or the online channel and where you feel pretty good about?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean other online brand that's very strong is TROJAN for example. That helped lead to the Personal Care organic growth in Q2. Across the board, oral care has been pretty strong as well and that's happening in club, online. Those are two examples, but again it's – we don't get all riled up about the tracked versus non-tracked, it's – a piece of it is, although the whole concept of promotional volume and not chasing that promotional volume, that causes a little bit of a disconnect between organic and consumption.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And, Bill, as you know, Personal Care products lend themselves more to online sales than the heavy litter and detergent products.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks so much.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks so much. Just if you could talk a little more in detail on the share movement. So I know you've touched on some of this already, but I guess six of 10 categories, you didn't gain share, which is unusual. Were some of those flat, and then what are the plans across the board to turn those around for the things you haven't talked about yet?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Okay. Well, the four that were up were OXI stain fighters, Nair, BATISTE and vitamins. So the other ones we might talk about, Spinbrush for example, that category, battery-operated toothbrushes, was up 9.5%. Our adult toothbrush was up 10% but kids was soft. So, sort of a balance there, it's where we fell back. XTRA, we talked about. Obviously deep discounting there, particularly on the part of Sun products and some Simply Tide as well. Orajel, the issue there was private label had a good quarter. Condoms, that kind of ebbs and flows, so we generally don't worry too much about the condom share because we have approximately 75% share in that category. FIRST RESPONSE through, there has been a lot of couponing and competition that we have to address. Some of that by the way for the earlier questions is pregnancy kits is also an area that we're putting some money behind in the second half because we lost some share as a result of competition in the second quarter. And the ARM & HAMMER brand in total all forms was down, driven by litter. It was down slightly, all forms about 10 basis points, but it was really litter that was the driver there. So, that's sort of the rundown on the 10 brands, Caroline.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Right. And does that – is that why you're getting more aggressive. Was that really driving the change, or is it simply you have the money to spend. Because, I mean, you generally love to claim that on almost all of your categories you're gaining share. So, is that the goal by year end? You want to up in all categories?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No, it's – look, when we say four out of 10 it's not like we're unhappy. I don't think we've ever had a 10 out of a 10 quarter, I think six would be great, six out of 10. And if the rest were around flattish. So yeah, I mean, some of them are – there are clearly issues in each of those different brands, but we expect to remedy them in the third quarter and fourth quarter.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Great. And then could you just comment on the UK, which I think is your biggest international market, maybe Canada is. Sorry, but how are things there?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So think of it, it's not just the UK. We have a European business that's our number one subsidiary followed by Canada, which is number two. Europe would encompass primarily the UK and France. And they've been doing fabulously behind BATISTE, certainly is their biggest brand. But they also have STERIMAR, which is a feminine hygiene brand and – or pardon me, Femfresh is a feminine hygiene brand, and then STERIMAR which is our nasal hygiene brand. So they've been doing extremely well.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. Because you didn't call out the UK and you usually do, so I just thought that maybe there were some issues already showing up?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: No, no, no. No issues, it's just that we have the league table. So the ones that are at the top of the league table in the quarter get to take a bow.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Great. And then lastly just on your margin profile online, is there any degradation of margin as you build up that business?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Actually some of the products that we sell online can be higher margin than they are in bricks-and-mortar. So it's a balance right now. We're pretty happy with the margins online. I think the heavier products like litter is where we'd be more pressed on margin. They would be lower than anything we would have in bricks-and-mortar.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, but overall, even online, the Personal Care mix is slanted toward Personal Care, so that helps the margin as well. So we're happy with that.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks a lot.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Caroline.
Operator: Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I guess, I'll just pick up there on the gross margin guide and I apologize if I missed this, was mix the biggest driver of the upside to the full year?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: To the full year? I would probably say, partly mix but also because of the organic revenue growth on Personal Care. But I'd also say, we were pleasantly surprised as we turned the corner on our vitamin manufacturing and our vitamin distribution efficiencies. A year ago when we were cutting customers, the trucks were going out every day and they weren't always filled, because we wanted to get that next shipment to the retailer as soon as possible. When we look back this quarter for example, our fill rate's closer to 99%. So we're shipping out full truckloads again. So that's as an example of what's going on with gross margin.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the third quarter, the organic up 1% to 2%. If you look at your volume growth the last few quarters, it's kind of averaged somewhere between 3% and 4%. So maybe if you could deconstruct for us what you're thinking in terms of volumes versus price mix in the third quarter, is it volumes up 2% to 3%, call it, maybe price mix down 1%?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Joe, I think, you are very familiar with the story. And we've been a perennial volume company. I think this past quarter we had some positive price mix as well and that was because we had lower promotions. It was – but I'd say for the go-forward, it's typically always volume. So that's how I would look at it.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Just one...
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then as we're spending back a little bit incrementally on promotions or whatnot, it might be a flat to slightly negative drag for price.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. I just ask it because – and this has been brought up previously on this call, but if you look at the third quarter compare for volumes, it's fairly easy – much easier than the second quarter. So that's why I'm just trying to look at those two drivers. But on the SG&A upside, it sounds like it's more of the same what you guys talked about last quarter which is investments and things like sales and IT, et cetera?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, that's what the difference between our original outlook of minus 10 basis points to plus 25 basis points of spending and that was really the conversation last quarter for the full year. Now that incremental 15 basis points is higher medical cost. Just like many other companies we are self-insured and every now and then we have catastrophic events that we have to cover and then, plus higher incentive comp. Gross margin's doing really well. So, is cash flow and we feel good about the outlook.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you for taking my question. I also wanted to go back to your guidance on gross margins for the 110 basis point improvement this year, the expectation. Just wanted to get a sense, as you look at that improvement, is there anything that you would consider unsustainable and I guess and potentially the new base of gross margins that you expect this year?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, the only thing – again, to break out the 110 basis points we said it was 60 basis points for commodities, 50 basis points for lower manufacturing cost, 10 basis points for price volume mix, 20 basis points from really the new acquisitions and the 30 basis points drag for FX. The commodity stuff, we are starting to lap. That really started a year ago in August. So, back half of 2015. So, that's not sustainable for our go forward future. So, that's always a risk. Lower manufacturing cost I think, we do a great job in this company with our productivity program and that's really – that leads into our kind of operating model. Price volume mix, so, typically we are a volume grower. We don't really take price in a lot of categories. Acquisitions, that's all dependent on what we do buy, typically we do recently have bought Personal Care type businesses with higher margins, and then of course the currency as we lap that drag, hopefully that will be a little bit more benign. So hopefully that gives you some color, Rupesh.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. And if I can ask one more question. Just if you look at the overall environment out there, a number of retailers, especially on the grocery side, have missed their comp numbers this past quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about the current environment out there?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is a question we get all the time, what's our perspective on the consumer? And I'm not going to tell you anything you haven't read in the Wall Street Journal. So we keep an eye on employment rates, median household income. You can see oil is going down again, it dipped below $40 this week. So obviously, that's good from a disposable income standpoint. But the issue is GDP. So GDP is, some of the banks are calling it 1.5% for the U.S. this year. So you don't have – and you don't have significant population growth. So everybody is struggling to find growth in the U.S. and oftentimes the suppliers, producers resort to price, if they don't have innovation. So that's sort of a – that's what we're looking at right now, Rupesh.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you for all the color.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Lauren.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, I just had one last question on the promotional environment. So I guess, laundry more so than litter is probably a category where when commodity costs improve you've seen the environment flare up over time. So a couple of questions: one, would you say, there are other categories in your portfolio where you feel like they are more commodity sensitive vis-à-vis promotional activity and that sort of this change in environment maybe should have been anticipated or in your outlook to begin with. Luckily, you've got plenty of wiggle room to deal with it. And then secondly, same would be on litter, just the standpoint you knew that Clorox was launching, I would actually think that maybe it was intentional to step back, let them spend a bunch and then kind of when that quieted down to get more active. So it's just the pattern of promotional activity doesn't strike me as necessarily surprising in litter. And then just if laundry you think is more commodity related than anything else? Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Hey, Lauren, did you say you were surprised by the promotional activity in litter?
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No. I'm not actually at all.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Okay. Because obviously we have Tidy Cat getting behind their light weight variants and Clorox has their litter with Febreze, so...
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Just thought you'd be tactical on your part. Like the other two have a lot of like noise, like let them promote their noise and then you'd kind of a take a break and then come back into the market?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Exactly, so we had pulled back on amount sold on deal in the second quarter for litter, and we lost some share. Okay. That's fine. It's not like that we're surprised by that, but one quarter doesn't make a year. Your question is, if you think about our various categories, are there a lot of other categories that are sensitive to commodities? I would say, other than laundry, that's where all the questions go and why, because we're worried about surfactants and ethylene prices and resin, et cetera. If you think about all the commodities that we sweat – just going to run down them. So there is surfactants, which is derived from ethylene and then you have resin. Diesel, which is going to affect our transportation costs, but that affects everything. Latex for condoms, but that's actually a small part of the cost of goods sold. And then you have paper, so we have so many things that are packaged in paperboard. So, and then as you get a lot smaller after that, soda ash, which is pretty tepid right now and things like palm fatty acid distillate. So, we would say with the exception of laundry, there aren't a lot of categories that we'd say are going to be dramatically affected by commodities.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, Lauren, I would add two things. Number one; I wouldn't expect – our comments on promotional volume isn't really saying we're going to go spend a lot of money back in the laundry category to drive promotions. We're going to continue to support OXICLEAN laundry. Right now if you look at the data, our amount sold on deal just in total is lower than a year ago or right at levels of a year ago. So we're not throwing a whole ton of money back into across the brands. The other thing I would say is from a commodity perspective; commodities are starting to inch up. So, we've said previously in Q1 and Q2, for example, that resin was down 10%, surfactants were down 20% and that was true. The second half, we're starting to lap those comparisons. So resin will likely be closer to be flat and surfactants will probably be closer to up slightly, just for context.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you so much.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Lauren.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Powers with UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. Hey, guys, I guess first, just one more cleanup if I could on the organic growth guidance for Q3.You got the increased promotional investment and I'm sure it's all to some extent conservative. But you call out in the release a more difficult year-over-year comparison in International specifically and again, my numbers could be incorrect. But it looks like both the one year and two year comps actually get sequentially easier in Q3 versus Q2. So can you just comment there, is there something that I'm missing or that you're specifically concerned about lapping?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I think, you're exactly right, Steve. I think, our comment started off at a country or two, Australia for example, has a high comp and that evolved to a one-liner in the release. But International, as I said before, the first half was really 10% growth and so with the full year at 7% to 8% and that means the second half is going to be closer to 4% or 5%. That's really the context you should think of for the International growth for the year.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I guess more – kind of more broadly, I think, it was back at your Analyst Day in January, you spent some time talking about distribution wins that you've been making over the past three years, four years, five years. I just wonder if you could weigh in a little bit on how much of the strength you've seen in this year is aided by even more distribution wins. And I'm guessing it's pretty broad-based where you're seeing it, but just if you can comment on which businesses you're having – those wins are having the most impact. I'm assuming it's things like vitamins and BATISTE. But, again, some context there will be helpful? Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No, there is no question, you hit the two that are leading the pack and one is vitamins, where as I said in my opening remarks that we have 5% increase in distribution which is pretty significant, because obviously that carries over into future quarters. And then BATISTE is just a craze. So it's getting more and more shelf space. And when you're the – there are more and more retailers becoming more interested in it. So, it seems like almost every quarter now, we're gaining more distribution and then that has a compounding effect. That's why we, although, it's a small brand, we continue to talk about it because it is influencing our numbers. So, you've hit on the two big ones there.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: All right, Steve.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for the questions.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Jason.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congratulations on a solid quarter and a good first half.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, thanks. Thank you.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple of clarifying questions. First, Rick, your comment on resin and surfactants, in terms of the trajectory in the back half of the year. Were you referring to sort of spot markets or the costs that you actually expect to roll through your P&L?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Spot markets.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And given your buy and I think you were a little bit long on hedges last year, which may have sort of prevented that roll through, is it fair to say that you're probably going to be more favorable than spot throughout the remainder of this year?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think we'll be more favorable than spot as we go into 2017.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Okay. So, there is some carryover into next year. And then, back to the questions on the volume trajectory which we've – there has been a few, right? But you are suggesting that volume decelerates on both a stand-alone and two-year stack basis, particularly on two-year stack pretty substantially despite the incremental spend. So, implicitly you seem to be suggesting that you are not expecting a lot of volumetric response to the incremental promotional dollars you're putting into market. Is that a fair interpretation and, if so, why?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so a couple things. I think I went through the detail of why it's not just the incremental promotional spending. But up against some higher comps for vitamins and the category comps for laundry, for example, and the whole International strong growth but deceleration. We're spending quite a bit of money back on marketing and that's going to take some time to really pull through demand. On the incremental trade and really couponing spending, those investments are really to drive trial for new products. That's the crux of it. And so we want to get that repeat rate up. I think it's too early to call volume upside from driving trial, so that really – we're just early in the process, Jason, and we think that when we get back up to our competitors' levels of promotion and are just on par with what we had a year ago even, we think that'll be a nice momentum as we exit 2016.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Just to add to that, Jason. If you went to first quarter 2015, the laundry category declined round numbers 1.5%, and then first quarter 2016 it was up 6.5%. So on a stack basis, I know a lot of people like to talk on a stack basis, you'd say laundry was up 5% on a two-year basis. And Q2, on a two-year basis stack, it was 4%. If you go to three and four last year, Q3 was 2.5% and Q4 was 3.5%. So that would suggest, you're going to see deceleration in laundry. If you're a believer in the stack theory and if we think it's going to be around 4% to 5%, we're seeing a deceleration in the laundry category on a year-over-year basis. So who knows that's just math. But it's something to think about.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Are you a believer in the stack theory, when it comes to the laundry outlook?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: No. I was introduced to it by the analysts.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: We like math. We like math. It's an easy calculation.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well. When it's convenient, I think you like to talk about it.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fair, fair. All right. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is open.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Could you just give us a bit of an update on your capacity utilization in vitamins. I know you've completed the capacity expansion, I think it was 75%, where you sit right now and really the idea here is the contribution margins out of this business, should we expect them to continue to improve as you fill out capacity going forward?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So we've talked about capacity utilization in terms of vitamins a few times and we said when we made that investment. It was a 75% increase in capacity in round numbers. When we said that our business was around $300 million and that would take us up to around $525 million. So we have a lot of runway for capacity. We feel great about that. We've made some great strides from a manufacturing perspective. We touched on earlier and even on distribution related to vitamins as well. What was the second part of your question, Jon?
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Well, I guess just kind of where you sit today relative to the $525 million in capacity you have and give us some sense...
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Right. We're not going to give you where our sales are today, but we have plenty of room to run. Your other part of the question was contribution margin.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And I talked about that a little bit last quarter and I said, it's going to take us a few years to grow into those fixed overheads. And it really goes back to the fact that, you're right, we have to get some more revenue and more scale. But every quarter that goes by, we get better and better at manufacturing vitamins in Pennsylvania and our skill set just improves all the time. So it's within reach within a few years. So we feel great about that.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: That's helpful. I may have missed this, I apologize if I did, but there's been a lot of discussion around the Nielsen data versus your own shipments. And I understand that non-measured, club, online plays a role in that. In aggregate as you look at it, were your shipments in line with consumption growth?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, absolutely. The other piece I've tried to explain once or twice, there is also a disconnect between when consumption is down and we don't promote in certain categories, our organic growth could be flat or up and so that's also a disconnect between shipments and organic growth.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. So, no disconnect here, no inventory building at retail, just some of these pieces which we can't see through Nielsen or IRI?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, last question for me is just as online continues to grow at a faster rate than the brick and mortar business, what are the implications for your margins if any or are you agnostic with respect to that? Thanks a lot.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, we touched on that a little bit earlier as well, we are pretty much agnostic. Because, while margins are tougher sometimes on the Household business. It's also slanted more towards the Personal Care type of portfolio that wants to go online. So, net-net when you blend those two together, we are pretty much agnostic.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask on BATISTE. So roughly to the extent you can, what's the split between sales in the U.S. and international? And then, how do we think about it as a driver from an international standpoint? Is it fair to call it the majority of international growth or is it just not big enough?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, with respect to what our sales are by country, we wouldn't get into that. And one thing I would like to dispel is the belief that the BATISTE is the sole driver of the international business. ARM & HAMMER is growing quite a bit in Canada and Mexico and this is kind of anchored in the benefits of baking soda and that seems to be resonating with people both in developed and emerging markets. Femfresh is another one I talked about which is feminine hygiene. One interesting phenomenon you might be interested in is there's a lot of product being purchased in Australia and then shipped to China like shelves being swept, we're not the only ones that have benefited that from time-to-time. So, that can help, has helped Australia from here and there. STERIMAR is the other one I talked about, so that's a nasal hygiene product. Had fabulous growth in Mexico this year and France last year behind strong marketing and lots of new products that we bring out. So it's a nice balance between our export business and our country growth.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then, I realize it's early and I'm not going to explicitly ask about gross margins for next year, but maybe as we sort of think about modeling it, are there any one-off type things, benefits, headwinds that would roll-off next year that we should think about in modeling?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: It's a little early, it's only August, but you may be familiar with our evergreen model. So every year we try to expand our operating margins 50 basis points and generally half of that that will come from SG&A and half of it from gross margin when we try to keep marketing pretty level and not save our way to prosperity by cutting our advertising.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. All right. There are no further questions. I want to thank you all dialing in today. We'll talk to you again at the end of October.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you about our business. I'll start with a brief review of our first quarter results, which you read about in this morning's press release. I will then direct the rest of my comments towards our categories. Then, I'm going to turn the call over to Rick Dierker when I'm done. Rick will comment on each business – that's Domestic, International, and Specialty Products – and also review the outlook for Q2 and for the full year. When Rick is finished, I'll get back on and we'll open the call up to questions. So here are the highlights. In short, Q1 was a terrific quarter for Church & Dwight. We delivered organic sales growth of 5.2% and 7.5% EPS growth, which is 10% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad based in that 11 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, six of our 10 power brands grew share; so all-in, these results are top tier in consumer products. Now, I would like to provide you with some color on a few of our categories; that would be laundry, litter, vitamins, and dry shampoo. The laundry category is strong, growing 6.4% versus year ago. This is the fourth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 6.1%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of value segment growth. In fact, for the last four quarters, value has grown, on average, 4.5% per quarter. The laundry category growth was driven by growth in both the unit dose and liquid segments. The value liquid segment grew at an 8% clip, driven by ARM & HAMMER liquid, which grew consumption a whopping 11% year-over-year. With respect to unit dose, this form now represents 15% of the laundry category. Our unit dose consumption grew 15% in the quarter. More recently, we have launched new two-chamber unit dose products under the OXICLEAN and ARM & HAMMER brands. We expect these new products to contribute to future consumption growth. Most of the resets for these launches happened in late March and early April. Now, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about our three laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years and the ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 30 basis points. To illustrate the strength of the ARM & HAMMER brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 25 consecutive quarters. Our XTRA brand backed off promotional volume in Q1, which improved our year-over-year profitability, but resulted in our giving up 40 basis points of share. On a full-year basis, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to be up year-over-year. OXI laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity. In the most recent four-week period, we are back to a one share, so promotional phasing does influence shares. If we look at how OXICLEAN is doing in the stain fighter additive category, OXICLEAN's share hit an all-time high of 48% share. Now, I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment continued to show strong growth at 5.3%. ARM & HAMMER litter was one of the winners in the quarter. We continue to grow faster than the segment. Our consumption grew 6.7%, behind our latest innovation, MICROGUARD CLUMP & SEAL litter. Just a quick commercial, MICROGUARD seals and destroys odors and prevents future bacterial odors from forming. It's an innovative product and we are broadcasting that message on our package, that 98% of consumers who have tried the product would recommend it. Now, let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew almost 15% in Q1. So let me break down the 15% for you. The adult gummy segment grew 23%, while the kids gummy segment declined 8%. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus as it is underdeveloped and it will be the source of future growth for us. Our brand, VITAFUSION, is the largest brand in the adult gummy category and was the biggest driver of the 23% adult segment category growth. The good news this quarter is that our gummy business is growing, again. We have had wide retailer acceptance of our new adult beauty line, which hit store shelves in March; so we're off to a good start this year for vitamins. The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 26% in Q1 year-over-year. A, the category in the U.S. is nearly $100 million, with the potential to be a $300 million category in the U.S. if we match the historical category growth experienced in the UK. BATISTE is the number one brand in the U.S. with a 17.2% share. BATISTE global net sales will cross $100 million this year, making it the number one dry shampoo brand globally. So it's no surprise that the BATISTE brand is expected to be one of our fastest-growing brands in the future. Many new products are shipping right now. I've mentioned dual chamber pods, MICROGUARD litter, and the vitamin beauty line. In addition, we have the new GROOVE condom and RIVIERA lubricant by TROJAN, and the new Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit from FIRST RESPONSE. We feel good about our distribution and we look forward to these products contributing to our organic growth in 2016. Our goal is to continue to focus on consumer insights, leading us to innovative new products to drive share and category growth. Next up is Rick to give you details on our first-quarter results and the outlook for Q2 and the full year.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. First-quarter reported EPS was $0.86 per share, compared to $0.80 in 2015, up 7.5%. The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat; netted in that $0.86 is $0.02, or a 2.5% drag, from currency year-over-year. Reported revenues were up 4.5% to $849 million. Organic sales were 5.2%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our Consumer business, both Domestic and International. Now, let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic businesses' organic sales increased by 4.5%, driven by the continued success of our ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, VITAFUSION gummy vitamins, BATISTE dry shampoo, and ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. We now expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 3% for the Consumer Domestic business. International organic growth was up an impressive 13.3%. Now, some of that was timing, as orders are a little lumpy in the export business, but underlying growth was very strong at approximately 9%. Here, again, we are raising our expectation for the full year: organic growth from 4% to approximately 5% to 6% for the Consumer International business. For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales was down 2%, driven by further declines in milk pricing and a difficult comp of 11% growth year ago. Milk prices have come down 10% in the last 90 days as there is an oversupply globally and, as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been 15%-plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We have lowered our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 1% to 3% to down 2%. This is a headwind that we expect to overcome for the full year. And we still like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time. Turning, now, to gross margin, our reported first quarter gross margin was 44.6%, an 80 basis point increase from year ago. Q1 gross margin benefited from three factors: lower commodities, productivity programs, and the higher margin from acquired businesses. These factors were partially offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix, and higher fixed costs associated with our new vitamin capacity in our York facility. Moving to marketing, we increased marketing spend by 4.2% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 10.9%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.6%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. This was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquisitions and the timing of management stock compensation. Now, to operating profit; the reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points lower than the prior year. Other income and expense was $6.4 million, largely $7 million of expense related to interest expense. Next is income taxes; our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%. And turning to cash, we had a strong cash flow quarter: we generated $178 million of net cash for the first quarter, a $33 million increase from the same quarter year ago. So in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 5.2% organic, 7.5% EPS growth, which, again, equates to a 10% currency-neutral EPS growth. Turning to the second quarter outlook, we expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%, and I know a lot of you guys like to look at growth on a two-year stack basis. Remember, for the total company, a year ago Q2 was 5% organic; so on the two-year stack, Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar at approximately 8%. And if we just focus in on the Consumer Domestic business for a minute, the two-year stack, it's going from 6.1% in Q1 to almost 8% in Q2; so a lot of positive momentum continuing on. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be flat year-over-year and gross margin to expand in Q2. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.79, compared to an adjusted $0.73 per share year ago, or an 8% increase year-over-year. And now, turning to the full year, to summarize our thinking, we are raising our expectations for organic sales growth from 3% to 3% to 4%. In February, we called approximately 40 basis points of gross margin expansion and we are pleased to say that now we are calling 70 basis points of gross margin expansion – 75 basis points. Back in February, this broke out as 70 basis points of help from commodities and productivity, offset by 30 basis points from currency headwinds. The 75 basis points we expect now is 100 basis points from commodities and productivity programs, offset by a 25 basis point drag from currency. We are more optimistic about the stability of commodity pricing across the entire commodity basket for the full year than we were a quarter ago. Our full-year marketing expectation continues to be 12.3% of sales, consistent with 2015 and prior years. Moving to SG&A, our original expectations were a 10 basis point reduction. We now expect a 25 basis point increase, largely behind R&D, IT, and international sales force investments. Let me give you a little color on these investments: first, investing in R&D projects behind our future product portfolio; second, investing in our international sales force footprint, specifically in high-growth areas of our business to drive future growth; and third, we expect higher ongoing IT infrastructure costs as we implement two new important systems, our spec management system for R&D and our trade management system for sales. We are positioning ourselves well for the future. We continue to expect 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. Next is income tax; we now expect 34.7% for the full year, so it's a little higher than our previous outlook of 34.5%. We continue to expect $630 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $55 million of CapEx for full-year 2016. This represents 125% free cash flow conversion. So now, Matt and I will open it up for questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from Bill Chappell. You may proceed, sir.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Bill. How are you?
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm good. Hey, Matt, maybe just a little bit more on the laundry category trend. This is certainly the highest volume, not just for you, but for the whole category, we've seen in a long time. I mean, it's tough to say if it's just because of pods coming into the category and bringing I mean .... The question is how sustainable is this? How much upside is this? And is it category-wide, or is it also market share related?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, is your question is the category growth driven solely by pods? Because it clearly is not.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. Well, I mean, the question is do you see mid-single-digit growth for the category throughout this year?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Look, I don't have the crystal ball to say if we're going to have mid-single digit the whole year. That's going to be a function of year-over-year comps, right? But all I can say is if we look at the trends, the trends have been strong with respect to liquid laundry for the last six quarters, and certainly the last four quarters, and no reason to expect that won't continue in the future.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, Rick, just on the SG&A guide, it was – it came in higher than expected in the first quarter. Is it safe to say a lot of the hires are front-end weighted?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, I want to clarify what – the only head count aspect of the incremental SG&A investment is really around – hasn't been done, yet. It's going to happen this year, but it's really more to the international footprint business, for the export business and for our Australian sub. So that's the only head count aspect of it. The rest is investments behind incremental projects, new ideas for the future, IT infrastructure costs, not necessarily head count, and we did have some of that in Q1. We expect those to happen throughout the year.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And just to clarify, were these things that were always in the plan or just momentum was so strong starting the year we started to bring some of these in?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, I think that's exactly what it was, is momentum is strong. You heard us raise our outlook for gross margin from 40 bps to 70 bps of expansion, and so we're choosing to make some of these investments now.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, great. I'll turn it over.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy. You may proceed.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey, first question, guys, the organic sales, clearly very strong in the quarter, but even specifically with respect to the Domestic business it's probably about 200 basis points higher than what we're seeing in the Nielsen data. Can you comment on that? Was there any timing benefit? Can you comment at all on retail or inventory levels? And then, I have a follow-up.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Are you saying it's a big pipe in the first quarter?
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Yes, so it's that, Matt, or are you seeing better growth in non-scan channels, like at Costco, as an example?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well, obviously, Costco is an important customer for us, both on the vitamin side and also the laundry side. So, it is true the non-measured channels do influence our results.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Just two more quickly for Rick or for you, Matt. What gets you to the higher end of the range for the balance of the year as you look out? How much of that is laundry, litter, vitamins? Maybe a little bit of commentary there would help. And then the other one, you guys generally comment on the M&A pipeline, what you're seeing and efforts there. So those two follow-ups will do it for me. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well, one of the reasons I chose to speak about the categories upfront, Kevin, is because laundry, litter, vitamins, and, more recently, the dry shampoo categories are catalysts to the Company, and we started the year with growth in all those categories and consumption growth as well. So that bodes well for us for the rest of the year; so that definitely influences our thinking on our success of the Domestic business in 2016. And the other piece of our full-year raise is, obviously, International. International had a rocking first quarter, and so we're taking up their number on a full-year basis as well.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: The M&A piece, Matt?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Say again?
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: The M&A pipeline? Yes.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: M&A, well, as we've said in the past, there's rarely a week when we're not looking at some transaction, but we don't go any further than that in our commentary. We're always looking, diligencing something, but we're pretty fussy about what we'll buy.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Bill Schmitz. You may proceed, sir.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Guys, good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Bill.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you talk about the gross margin progression? Because the natural flow of the business, and if you look at what some of the other folks in laundry have done, just given the year-over-year decline in a lot of commodity costs, the gross margin should naturally be a lot higher. And, obviously, you beat your guidance and raised it for the full year, but what is offsetting that natural flow through of what you would expect, given this commodity and category growth environment?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Bill, I think that's a fair question. We talked about it a little bit on our Analyst Day and we talked through some of the headwinds, like transactional currency. But I'd say, overall, we're really pleased with our gross margin expansion. We just talked about how we're going from 40 basis points to 75 basis points, so essentially we're doubling it; and that entire doubling of it is largely commodities. I think we feel more comfortable with that full-year outlook of commodities. So, do we have one-offs every now and then on write-offs and whatnot that burden gross margin? Sure, but overall, in general, we're really happy about doubling our gross margin outlook, pretty much, and if commodities continue to stay where they're at or improve, we'll probably be talking about it again.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, I know this is a small one and maybe it's a little nitpicky, but on this Spencer Forrest acquisition, I think you spent $175 million for $30 million of sales. Is there this massive growth trajectory of the business? Is that why you paid such a high multiple of sales?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think we probably got similar questions like that when we bought BATISTE back in 2011. The way to think about that, Bill, is that the hair thinning category is about a $240 million category. That's mostly dominated by topicals, brands like Rogaine. And our point of view is that hair thinning can also be addressed with hair fibers, and we bought a product that we think is going to have significant growth in future because it addresses the problem in a cosmetic fashion and not with chemicals.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and then maybe just back to that gross margin thing very quickly because, on my math, you should do 300 basis points of gross margin expansion this year. But this quarter, was there a purchase accounting step up or anything like that that impacted the gross margin from this TOPPIK deal?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. No, there's not. And we can take it off-line at some point, but there is no way that we had the exposure from the commodities to make it a 300 basis point move. We just don't have that type of volatility.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thanks so much.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: All right, Bill.
Operator: And our next question comes from Caroline Levy. You may proceed.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks so much. I wanted to talk about your new products. You went through some stuff pretty quickly, but can you elaborate on some of the major ideas and why you think that this is going to keep the momentum strong, and if you think your market share gains can continue?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've been the leader in the litter category for many years, now. If you remember when we spoke downtown in February, we showed a chart that showed our innovations over the past three years or four years. So we've clearly been the catalyst for that category, and we have a winner again this year with the MICROGUARD product. So we're driving growth in the category, which is a big category, and we're taking share. And we generally have a big new idea every year, so we think we can continue that in the future. With respect to laundry, as I said earlier, while ARM & HAMMER has been quite a powerhouse for us for a long time, the new product this year – one of them, is the BioEnzyme product, which has the EPA Safer Choice label, which is becoming more meaningful to all shoppers. So we think that's a nice new variant for us that's going to help us continue to grow the franchise. Some of the other things I mentioned, vitamins, what we did was we decided to shrink-wrap our products, so we got beautiful new packaging, which obviously speaks out or pops on shelf; and we think that is going to be a winner for us this year as well. Continuing down the line, in the TROJAN, TROJAN RIVIERA, so this is – you may recall this is a lubricant that can be used in the shower. So that's another consumer insight that we think is going to help expand the share for TROJAN. And as you know, TROJAN's share continues to grow. We're up slightly year-over-year, a little over 76% share. And FIRST RESPONSE, again, is the number one brand in pregnancy test kits, and we're the first people to come out to try a Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit. So that's our – what we're trying to do there is test and learn in what we call the Internet of Things. So we have a very robust new product development process. We're very focused on consumer insights and that does lead us to really cool ideas with respect to new products, and we've got a nice pipeline for 2017 and 2018. So that gives us confidence that we continue to grow the top-line organically.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: That's great. And if I just may ask how much the TOPPIK should – TOPPIK acquisition should continue to contribute? Is it about a percentage point to growth through the balance of the year?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, remember, that's a small business. It's about $30 million in total, right, so...
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. So, yes, about 1% for the full year on a reported basis.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: On a reported basis, yeah.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Got it. And then, just lastly on buybacks, you actually were well ahead of what we expected in the first quarter at $200 million. The longer it takes for you to find a big acquisition can we expect a higher run rate on buybacks, now, perhaps?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Caroline, I think we were right on our expectations for a buyback. We said we were going to do around $300 million this year of buybacks, and we did $100 million in December. We did about $200 million in February, and if you look at our past practice, we typically get ahead of our full-year buyback in Q1. So $300 million is right on target. We feel good about that number. I think, as you've seen us in the past, if we go many, many, many years without doing an acquisition and we have the cash build up on the balance sheet, then we always look back and say how do we return that to shareholders.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: So you could step it up in the fourth quarter, but don't expect much for the balance of the year, probably?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I would say that $300 million is our sweet spot for this year as of now.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joe Altobello. You may proceed.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. First question on the categories, obviously getting better, you did mention back in February that that could be potential upside to guidance. Is there any larger takeaway on the broader consumer in the U.S. from the fact that 11 of your 15 categories were up?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, that's a good question, Joe. So we know everybody has their own crystal ball about the economy and we do look at it the same way; so we always monitor those 15 categories. So having 11 of the 15 up is a very good sign, and the four that weren't up are some of the – at least three of them are some of the smaller categories. So I would say, yes, that is a good sign. Of course, you have to temper that by – if you look at some of the big houses, most big banks, more recently, have reduced the GDP outlook for the U.S. this year to 1.5%; so, obviously there is some pessimism out there. The credit card debt is going up. Some people speculate that fuel savings are going to healthcare costs. So there's definitely a couple different camps out there with respect to the economy. For our part, we do look at these categories and we see a lot of strength in them, so we don't think that's going to turn around that quickly. We think it should stay strong for the rest of the year.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And how are retailers managing inventories? Are they getting a little bit more – or, actually, less conservative, given that?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I wouldn't say that. I think the retailers are no different than any of the CPG companies and everybody looks at working capital very closely. So, no, I wouldn't say there would be any change in practice there.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, you mentioned that kids gummies, the category, was down 8%; just curious what drove that.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, the kids gummy section has been trending down for more than just this quarter, for a while. And the speculation around that is that, once upon a time, before the advent of adult gummies, that adults took kids gummies, and that with a lot of adult gummies now coming on shelf, adults are using the adult gummies and not the kids. So that's why I said earlier is that our focus is on adults. Kids is a very mature category. Even when we bought the business, if you looked at vitamins, two-thirds of all the vitamins that children took in the U.S. were gummies. So it was already saturated, and so there's some migration from kids to adults.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And one last one, I have to ask on OXICLEAN laundry detergent. It looks like the shares were down, again, a little bit this quarter. What's your thinking there, maybe plans for that brand going forward in that category?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, look, it's no secret that you have a new entrant into high-end laundry detergent last year with Henkel's Persil brand. And they went to Walmart and Amazon, and then at the end of the year, and now, they're expanding and doing a lot of couponing, et cetera. So, there is – the activity is very fierce right now with respect to couponing from those guys. So, obviously, we would be a victim of some of that. So we lost some share, but, as I said in my earlier remarks, you are right. In the quarter, we did lose 20 basis points of share. If you look the more recent week, we're back to a one share; but it's sort of a steady state, one share right now, and we're really trying to crack the code here and figure out how to grow that brand. But we are still committed to it.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason Gere. You may proceed.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions; one, I guess, obviously, every few years one of your big competitors finds some cost-cutting initiatives in place and everybody fears about what could happen to some of the categories. And laundry, in particular, the category seems to be strong, so you talked a little bit about Persil and a little bit of the couponing there. Is there anything on the front from that big competitor right now that they may go after some of the shares that they've seen either at the high end or even push more behind their value brand just to get greater growth?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: No, Jason, I don't have any intelligence, other than what you see in the marketplace today, that they're big push is in the high end with Persil, pretty aggressive claims. And there is nothing more to report from that competitor.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, but how about the other competitor, the bigger one, the big dog? I'm talking about just as they're pushing a little bit more with Simply Clean or even at – as they've seen that you've made the foray into the pods, just wondering if there's any intel there? It seems like you guys feel pretty comfortable about how this year is playing out, but what does history teach you?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, maybe it'll help you if I comment just on the amount sold on deal in laundry last year versus this year. So last year first quarter, it was 36% for the category, and this year first quarter, it's 35%; so not much of a change year-over-year. If you're talking about what new innovations they have, I think we all know that they have a similar product to our BioEnzyme that they just launched; but I don't have any other color other than that.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. No, that's good. And then the other question, just going back to some of the investments on the international sales force, and I know you talked a lot more about the export business, but just curious your thoughts. You've been predominantly a domestic business, with some of the categories being able to carry over to your – more your North American international counterparts, Mexico, Canada, et cetera. But with this expansion in international, does it change your thinking about the portfolio you have getting greater expansion, whether in new markets or even with expanding some of the categories that you're in domestically? So just wondering if we should read into anything there.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, look, when we talk about the International division, we have our countries, so we have six primary countries, and then we have an export business. And we have found that we've had a lot of success with our products in a lot of countries other than those six countries that I mentioned where we have subsidiaries. And we've got a terrific leadership team in the export business, and they've been driving a lot of growth. And when you have people that are successful like that and they have plans to execute to drive that growth, we said we're going to add the head count. And you know how stingy we are around here about adding heads. So we're going to invest behind these guys in export, and we're also doing the same in the Specialty Products Division. We bought a business a year ago, a small business, to add to our animal productivity business, and, likewise, we have the ability to go international with some of those products as well. This is both in dairy and in poultry. So we're going to invest for the future and, because we had a rocking first quarter and things are looking up for the year, we said, hey, this is a good time to reinvest.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks for the color. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Powers. You may proceed.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks. A follow-up on domestic growth trending above tracked channels. I know it's a small base, but how much of that was from strength in e-commerce? And what, if anything, are you guys doing differently in that area as online demand accelerates?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, that's a good question. Most CPG companies have their online sales between 1% and 3%, and when I say 1% – that range would include all the usual suspects, the amazon.com, walmart.com, target.com, et cetera, et cetera. So, I would say most CPG companies are in the early innings with respect to selling product online. Now, of course, that can change very quickly. For our part – when I say change very quickly, it's not going to go to 5% or 10% in just a couple years, but it will change over time. So we've decided that we want to get really good at that, so it's one of our focuses right now. It did not – was not a big contributor, I would say, to the first quarter results, but we are going to have higher online sales this year, year-over-year, by a meaningful percentage year-over-year.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: And is – does it have anything to do – are any of the investments you're making incrementally this year in SG&A, are any of them related to e-commerce capabilities?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. We've hired a couple people, and you may have seen recently the Dash Buttons for Amazon. So there are six Dash Buttons out there: TROJAN, BATISTE, VITAFUSION, L'IL CRITTERS, OXICLEAN, and ARM & HAMMER Litter. So I hope everybody on the call is getting a couple of those buttons for their refrigerators.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: There you go. Okay. Great. Thanks, and I guess – it's really small, I know, but can you just quantify, Rick, the deal amortization in the quarter and what you just – the number, incremental amortization year-over-year for the full year? Thanks.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I would say that in Q1 the TOPPIK acquisition had a really high SG&A rate, it was probably around 15%, and part of that is amortization, part of that's transition costs. So all-in, it was around 40 basis points to the quarter.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. You may proceed.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Just first, Rick, to follow up on that, that was the first quarter impact from the higher SG&A, but going forward, what would be the amortization because the transition cost would obviously go away?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, it's probably about half of that.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right, thanks. And then, also, just in terms of the incremental spending overall, Matt, you said it yourself. You guys are stingy and incredible cost control over the years, so I just found it striking that you found this much that you want to put money back into. So are these areas that – I know you said it was – you had the flex, but why didn't you go after them before? What does it add incrementally to the growth potential that you wouldn't have had without the investment? I just think it's interesting, given how tight you've been with investment over time, the decision to put so much back in.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well, Lauren, we wouldn't quantify our business model with respect to how many people did we or are we adding, and what's the sales and profits associated with that. The point is that has been a focus for us, the export business. Even before we made this decision, we had hired even stronger people there. So this is just another increment on top of that increment.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, and let me put a little bit of context behind it, too. We're talking about a move of going from down 10 basis points in SG&A to up 25 basis points. That's around $11 million or $12 million, right? We're adding, whatever, $3 million or so from incremental R&D projects, not head count, just more opportunities for the future, more NPD, more resources to work on different things. There's a couple million dollars for the head count for the International business and the export business, and there's a few million dollars for higher IT infrastructure costs. So it's not like we're taking a huge dollar amount and going and investing in head count. I just want to be clear on that.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And on the International, what would it be – what would be the decision point for you guys to move from an export model to being – establishing local operations and running it like more of an affiliate model?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, that's a really good question, and to do something like that, you'd have to have one of your brands really have enough critical mass so that you could enter that market. And there are a couple of countries we're looking at right now, but we wouldn't disclose that.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason English. You may proceed.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jason.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congrats on the solid start to the year.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: (39:12).
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to come back and rehash some of the questions that have already been asked. First, to Bill Schmitz' question on gross margins, 300 basis points that he gets to mathematically seems pretty optimistic, but I agree with his general premise that mathematically it's not that hard to get well above where you're guiding to. So a couple of questions just to help us understand this; first, commodities, is there something to consider in terms of your hedge positions for last year, this year, et cetera, that may cause your benefit or lack thereof to be greater or worse than what we'd see in spot markets? And then, secondly, the leakage on the fixed-cost absorption for the new vitamin plant, I appreciate that that's here to stay for a while, but you're soon going to start to lap the startup expenses. Do those two effectively wash, or our expectation was that you could actually get a surplus, that the startup costs were greater than the fixed-cost de-leverage you're getting now?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, sure. So I'll take the commodity question first. So we had said previously, and it's still the case, that, in general, resin was down 10%, surfactants were down 20%, paper was relatively flat. You guys know what oil and diesel are doing, and those are favorable year-over-year as well. I think, in general, we do have some hedges out there. We went into the year with about 30% hedged, which is really our lowest level in quite a few years because we thought we should float most of the market. We do have a couple hedges on surfactants, so maybe we're not getting the entire spot market benefit, but, in general, 300 basis points is not realistic for us at all. So we do have that as a tailwind, in general, from commodities. Fixed costs for vitamins; now remember, we told you guys this was a 75% increase in capacity, so a $300 million business becomes $525 million. It's going to take some time to really grow into those fixed overheads. And you're right, we had startup costs last year, but those fixed overheads are more in totality than the startup costs were a year ago.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. That's helpful. And then, back to the laundry category growth, we see the lower promotional activity. We see some of the mix-up that's happening in the category. But when we do our best to try to get to a load equivalent volume, we're seeing volume on a load equivalized basis growing north of 3%, which is a bit of a head-scratcher, right, because it's hard to imagine that people have just decided – or have more dirty clothes or are doing more laundry. Any views on what's driving that volumetric growth from a load equivalized perspective?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think I have to agree with you, Jason, that it's a head-scratcher. I could say in the past at times we think sometimes the information that we use on volume, you have to take with a grain of salt because of all the different sizes within the category. If you think about wash loads, so if you're saying there's a lot more wash loads, it's illogical to think that there's 3% or 4% more wash loads being done with population growth only 1.5%.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Do you...
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Jason, the other thing there is...
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, go ahead.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: ...we do see trends. There's a certain percentage of the category that does mix pods and liquid laundry, so that might throw off your wash load metrics as well.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Okay, cool. Well, I'll just pass it on. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Olivia Tong. You may proceed.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. Just one for me is around a little bit more about gross margin and more the gross to net spend that you guys do, because there has been a lot of talk this quarter amongst other HBC companies about that line item. So, first, how much is your spend in that area and how has that been trending?
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, we don't want to go into the details between gross to net and all of our trade spending, Olivia. I would say we continue to watch the trade spending, just like we do every item in the P&L; and Matt has given you context on laundry. That's a good indicator, right? Amount sold on deal for laundry a year ago was 36%. Now it's 35%. For litter, it was 24% a year ago. Now it's 22%. Vitamins is another big category for us, and that was 39% a year ago and it's 39% this year. So there's a little context.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jon Andersen. You may proceed.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jon.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just two quick ones for me. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your, I guess, latest power brand, BATISTE, and provide some context around the opportunity in the U.S. I think dry shampoo is a bigger part of the shampoo category in the UK, but could you give us maybe some metrics there so we can try and understand the opportunity that lies ahead here in the U.S.? And then, the second question is just an update on the potential for another round of compaction in liquid laundry. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, as far as the context for the BATISTE opportunity is look at the UK. The UK, round numbers, has about 60 million people, and it has – the category there is about $60 million. So you just do the quick math, you have 335 million people in the U.S. So you've got five times the population, so we'd say, well, you've got an opportunity for five times the category size; that would be $60 million becomes $300 million here. So that really is the math behind the thinking that this could be a much bigger category.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: And then, on compaction in laundry?
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah as far as compaction, yeah, well, it's nothing to report on compaction. I think the last time that anything was said publicly, Walmart was thinking about the end of 2017 or early 2018; but there's no discussion about that right now.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Good – congrats on the good start.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jon.
Richard A. Dierker - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Jon.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time.
Matthew T. Farrell - President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining us.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in the detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. We're uptown this year. We normally have this conference at the New York Stock Exchange; it's under construction this year. So, next year we'll be back. Rick Dierker is with me today, our new CFO. We have the entire management team here as well. We'll come up here when we're done with the presentation and they'll be available for Q&A. So, let's begin. So we have the obligatory Safe Harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read it. And here is the agenda. I'm going to talk about who we are, the categories that are most important to us, that will be laundry and vitamins, how we deliver, how we run the company, and then Rick is going to take everybody through the financials. Okay. Here is what you're going to hear today. I'm just going to pull it all up on the screen for you viewers at home, but the short story goes like this. We had a terrific 2015. So we had 8% EPS growth, and on an all-in basis, it's 12% local currency. We had full year organic sales growth of 3.6%. This puts us well above our evergreen target of 3%. We had a strong finish as we saw the consumer business grow 3.3% in the fourth quarter and we have really good momentum going into 2016. Our new product pipeline is off to a good start. You can ask Lou a few questions about that when we get to Q&A, and we expect 3% organic revenue growth again in 2016. On the EPS front, 2016 outlook is again up 7% to 9% all-in, and that's 9% to 11% on a total currency basis. That's top since CBG as you know. We announced the dividend increase today, that's to keep our payout ratio at 40%. And finally, we closed a small bolt-on acquisition in early January. We're always on the hunt for good brand acquisitions, so we're excited about the future. So let's begin. Okay. Church & Dwight was founded in 1846, so we have our 170th birthday coming up this year. And in 19th century, it was founded with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Today, we have 10 brands that drive our revenues and profits. These are our 10 power brands. In the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. All nine of those other brands were acquired, since the year 2000. Our most recent power brand is now BATISTE. BATISTE is a business, the dry shampoo that we bought in 2011, and in 2016 the global sales of that brand will cross $100 million. Okay, those 10 brands drive our revenues and profits, 80% of our sales and over 80% of our profits. And of those 10, four are mega brands. These are four strong brands that have the ability to go into adjacent categories. And of those mega brands, those mega brands drive 60% of our revenue and over 60% of our profits. As I said, we are an acquirer. Those are the nine brands that we've acquired. And as you can see also, we generally are focused on number one brand. Okay, we're primarily a U.S. companies today; 82% U.S., 18% International. This has the benefit of having minimal exposure to the weakening foreign economies. And we're very balanced, about half Personal Care and half Household with Specialty Products' business rounding it out at 8%. Okay, we are in the land of the giants. So we are a small company. In 2016, we'll have about $3.5 billion in sales, small company but big returns. So the shareholder return one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year period been stellar for our shareholders. Let's talk about the categories that are important to us. So first, laundry. So here is the depiction of the laundry category for the past four years, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. As you can see, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, both the total category and the liquid category declined in each of those three years. That turned around in 2015, particularly in the second half. So on a full year basis, the total categories up 1.6% and liquid up 0.7%. One of the added benefits of 2014, going to 2015, it was actually a stable promotional environment, so that contributed to the rise. Let's continue on the second category I want to talk about is vitamins. As you know, in 2012 we acquired the Avid business, that got us into gummy vitamins. Why were we attracted to gummy vitamins? It's because it's been a fast growing category. In fact the vitamin, mineral and supplement category has been a mid-single-digit grower for many, many years. That flattened out in 2014. Why? Because of negative press and the growth has been rekindled again in 2015. So the category is growing. The other thing I want you to focus on is the gummy form. So the reason this is attractive is because pills and capsules becoming less popular and gummies are becoming more popular. So if you look in 2012, you can see only 7% of the category was gummy. Today it's 12%. And if you look at how did the gummy form grow in 2015, it grew 16%. And the good news is that we are the number one brand in both adult and in children's vitamins, gummy vitamins. Okay. Here's the one I want to end on as far as trends go. This is dry shampoo. As I mentioned earlier that we acquired BATISTE in 2011 and in 2016, we're going to cross $100 million in sales. We're the number one dry shampoo in the UK and in the U.S. In the UK, we have a 75% share; in U.S. we have a 15% share, round numbers. So here's the interesting factoid. So the UK has a retail category of $60 million with a population of 65 million. In the U.S. where the dry shampoo category is in the early innings, it's only a $90 million category. We have a population of 319 million. So we see a lot of runway ahead of us in this category and for this brand. Okay how we deliver? If you're a shareholder, you're well aware of the 10 drivers of shareholder return, let's review. First, we have a recession-resistant portfolio. This is very important. So we have a portfolio that's going to perform well in any economy, 60% premium and 40% value. Okay here's an illustration of some of our products. You can see in many cases, our value brand is about 50%, less expensive than the premium brand. Now let's talk about new products. Okay first up is ARM & HAMMER. So we're really excited about our 2016 product offerings. On the left hand side, you see CLUMP & SEAL, so we have a new variant coming to CLUMP & SEAL, that's CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. Now MicroGuard not only seals and destroys odors, but it also prevents future bacterial odors. On the right hand side, see BioEnzyme. So we have a new laundry variant in detergent and that's BioEnzyme. It's formulated to meet the Safer Choice environmental standards promulgated by the EPA. The third thing, it's not on the screen is that we also have a dual chamber pod that we're launching under the ARM & HAMMER banner in 2016. A little bit more on CLUMP & SEAL. So, in 2015 we came out with lightweight and naturals followed by MicroGuard in 2016, but here's a story that's worth telling. We have been an innovator in cat litter for years. So if you go back to 2011, you see Double Duty followed by Ultra Last. And you see what happens when you don't have innovation in the year, you flat line. So in 2014, we came out with CLUMP & SEAL, the best cat litter that's out there. In 2015, we follow with naturals and lightweight, and then 2016, we follow with MicroGuard. Great story. [Video Presentation] (08:27-09:00) Okay. Let's keep going. Let's turn to OXICLEAN. A couple of things on OXICLEAN this year. So we have a new liquid laundry detergent called OXICLEAN Preserve. This laundry detergent reduces pilling in your clothing. And just as we have a dual chamber pod for ARM & HAMMER, we also have one for OXICLEAN, called OXICLEAN HD. Just let's review the OXICLEAN mega brands for a minute, so to start with laundry additives. So laundry additives, we had a record share 45.9% up 130 basis points led by White Revive, which was our entry into the bleach category. Second is the laundry detergent. We ended the year with a 1% share. We had a 0.8% share at the end of 2014. It's not moving as fast as we had hoped. The good news is that trial, repeat and consumption are all up year-over-year. And then finally auto dish detergent category. It's a difficult category. We've got 1.3% share in 2015. Okay, TROJAN. Three new offerings for TROJAN, first condoms. So we have TROJAN GROOVE, so this is a grooved condom that retains the lubricant on the condom during sex. Number two is TROJAN RIVIERA for those of you have been waiting for a lubricant for use in the shower, you now have one, so long-lasting lubrication. And the third one is TROJAN Divine, which is a multispeed vibrating massager. I'm not sure if one, two or all three of these are in your goody bags today. That'll be a little bit of a surprise. Okay. Vitamins; so lots of new products in the vitamins space, so first beauty. So a new beauty line with really attractive new packaging, also a couple offerings for teens both teen sport and also teen hair, skin and nails and then licenses. Licenses have become increasingly important in the children's category. So we had Barbie and Mario launch in 2015, and then this month we have Minions as well, so that bodes well for our children's gummy vitamin. And finally first response, so there is now a Bluetooth Pregnancy Test Kit. So you download the app to your iPhone. You use the pregnancy kit. It sends a result to your app. And what the app does for you? It provides you lots of information throughout your pregnancy. So we've all heard about the Internet of Things, so this is our first foray into the Internet of Things, so it's our ability to test and learn. All right. Marketing, so you've often heard us talk about how much money we spend on marketing. We're the 15th largest advertiser in the U.S. So we're in pretty good company here as you can see on the slide. And we've also said that our marketing would generally bang around between 12% and 13% of sales. So you can see over the last four years we've averaged around 12.5%. And it's going to show-up in your shares. So if I call your attention to the right hand side of this slide, this is our report card. So on the top, you have your mega brands and in the bottom you have your remaining power brands. So, three out of four of our mega brands grew share in 2015. Vitamins is yellow. Why? We went sideways this past year. It's well-known. We had some difficulties with the new plant start-up, that's well behind us now. And then with respect to the other six power brands, you see XTRA is red, but actually XTRA profits were up in 2015 versus 2014, as we didn't chase the competition down in discounting, and battery-operated toothbrushes has been a perennial difficult category, that's also red, but seven out of 10 were green. Okay, distribution. So this is a new information for you. We took a look at our distribution gains over the past six years. So we looked at 2009 to 2012, and then separately 2012 to 2015. So we're happy to report that we've been consistent in expanding our distribution year after year after year. We expect to continue to do this in the future. And while we're on the topic of distribution, BATISTE with a 15.2% share today, that share is only going to grow because we're expanding top retailers in 2016, another good story. Okay, defense of our brands. It's no secret that the laundry category has been a difficult category for all competitors for several years now. So in 2014, you had Simply Tide show-up in the value tier, 2015 had Persil show-up in the premium tier; and on top of that you have price wars breaking out. So what happened? So, just left to right; in 2013 we had a 14% share; 2014, 14.2% share; 2015 14.4% share. So in each of the past years, we've expanded share in spite of the new entrants in the price wars; and we expect to continue expand share in the future. International. So just as I said in the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. Near 2001, we were just a U.S. company. Today, we're a little bit more diverse, 82% as I said early is U.S., and 18% is International. This is how it's spread out. We have a European business unit, which is our largest business unit that encompasses the UK and France. That's 37% of the business, followed by number two Canada, then Mexico and Australia. Our International business has been a stellar performer for many years. If you look at the CAGR for the last five years, virtually every business, every country is at or above our 3% evergreen target. Now, gross margin. So here is a six-year look at gross margin. So if you think about the first three years, 2010, 2011, 2012, we're all still dealing with the commodity super cycle, so that was depressing margins. And then, more recently you had price wars break out. And that's a bit of an offset from commodity abatement, but we've been around 44.5% gross margins for good long time, in spite of all those factors. The four ways we drive gross margin, this is familiar to many of our shareholders and we'll go clockwise here. So good to great, that's the name of our continuous improvement program. Second is supply chain optimization. As you know, we've built a couple of plants in the last five years. Number three, new products. So, when we launch new products, those new products need to have higher than average gross margins. And finally, acquisitions. And when we buy, one of our requirements is that we buy businesses that at or above are existing corporate gross margin. Okay. And as you know we have a very simple compensation structure, we promote financial literacy within the company. One of the ways we do that is we tie gross margin is – 25% of all employees' annual bonus is tied to us achieving the gross margin target. Next is acquisitions. So we have a very strict criteria with respect to acquisitions. Consequently, we're very fussy about the brands and the businesses we're going to buy and this criteria hasn't changed in quite a few years. Long history of acquisitions, obviously that contributed to our top-line growth. 2004, we were about $1.5 billion; we're $3.5 billion today. Good chuck of that was driven by acquisitions. And a good way to think about Church & Dwight is an acquisition platform. So when we acquire businesses, we grow the revenue and we get cost energies. So, how do we do that? So with respect to the revenue growth, we have veteran marketers within the company. We have a separate new product development process, separate from the business units. And as a result we expand shares. As far as the cost synergies go, we'll leverage the new brand across all classes of trade, and we have a supply chain and R&D organization that are very versatile. So we can handle liquid, aerosols, powders, gels, devices et cetera. And our track record is stellar in nine out of 10 power brands so we get costs synergies every time. And Rick's going to tell a little bit more about access to capital when he gets up here. Okay, how have we done? So if we acquire a business, what was the pre-acquisitions share, what's the share today? In every case, you see that we expand shares. And topic you probably read in the release that we acquired this brand earlier this month; we were entering the hair thinning category. This is a problem solution brand. If you think about the characteristics of it, we think it's very much like the teeth. We had a couple of non-CHD investors agreed to demo the product, here's the male, before and after. And here's a woman before-and-after. And happily if you've retained more than 50% of your hair, and you know who you are, particularly sell-side analysts, this product is for you. A nice side benefit of this by the way is that, they have a very robust sales and marketing team online. So, we're going to learn a lot from them. If you want to learn more about the product, you can go to toppik.com. Okay. Best-in-class free cash flow, Rick's going to take you through that, but we've averaged well above our peers for many years. SG&A, this is a hallmark of the company. You can see that we have extremely productive employees and we're the lowest SG&A of any CPG company and we intend to stay there. We have expert management team with lots of people, lots of experience in all of these seats and driven by a simple compensation program. I said earlier, that gross margin is 25% of the annual bonus. The rest is cash from operations, EPS and net revenue, very easy to explain, very easy to remember and our long-term compensation is a 100% stock options and we're all required to be heavily invested in the company's stock. And here are the results again. So stellar returns to our shareholders over the one-year, three-year, five-year and 10 year-period. Okay. How we run the company? We have an evergreen model. So we always target 3% organic growth annually and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and we're targeting 8% EPS growth. Okay. As far as our operating system goes, first is the evergreen model; second is we know what geographies we're focusing on, North America first, that's Canada, U.S. and Mexico and secondarily Europe and Asia. Allocation to capital, Rick's going to take you through but at top of the list and these are in order of importance, is TSR accretive acquisitions. And finally those acquisition criteria haven't changed in years and we have four operating principles. So, we have number one brands that we leverage, we're very asset-light, we're not capital intensive, we generate lots of cash flow so we leverage assets and we have very productive employees, the most productive employees in the CPG space. All of that combines for good returns, but when you leverage acquisitions on top of that, you get spectacular returns. Okay. Now I'm going to bring Rick up here to talk about financials.
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to cover three topics. We're going talk about the quarter, Q4, and just how we came in. We'll go through 2015, and some of the details there. Then talk about 2015 outlook, but there's one theme to take away from the financials today, that truly 2015 ended well and we have a lot of momentum as we go into 2016, lot of optimism. So Q4, 2.6% organic sales growth. 3.3% for the Consumer Domestic division, largely driven by volume. We'll get into the details in a second, the 2.5% volume growth. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points behind commodity improvement, behind our productivity programs, a lot of our price in the laundry is normalized, the same theme you've been hearing about all year long. Marketing was down 10 basis points, so essentially flat, and SG&A was up 10 basis points. So operating margin was up 50 basis points. So EPS is up 5%, and currency neutral EPS is up 9%. Great result. So through the quarters of 2015, pretty consistent; 2.6% in Q4 remember versus a year ago, we were at 5.2%. So really strong growth in Q4 off of a high comp year ago. You guys like to look at the stack bars, so, we threw in in here for consumer business. This is just the strength – relative strength of the consumer business, a lot of momentum going into Q4, 7.2% in Q4. So, we're exiting the year at a strong rate. Categories are strong. So, volume is the growth driver, 2.5%, at a 2.6% from the organic side for the company; 3.2% for the domestic division. With international division, we do get a little price as we go into the FX headwinds. And then SPD, we're down 4%, largely on volume because no prices have come down. Great trend, great momentum on gross margin as well, 45.5% for the quarter, and as I said before, normalized pricing environment. Commodities are a tailwind, and productivity programs continue, and a lot of our vitamin issues for start-up happened earlier in the year. Marketing spend, highest percentage, highest dollar amount of the year. And that leads to share growth, seven out of our 10 power brands, and Matt walked you through those details, three or four megabrands grew as well. So, let's recap on the full year, 3.5% organic sales growth, compares to 3% outlook earlier in the year, largely volume-driven. Gross margin is up 40 basis points, for all the reasons I already walked through. Marketing is down 30 basis points; now, we talked about that a little bit on our Q3 call. We reallocated some of the marketing spend and put it in the trade line for OXICLEAN to drive trial, and as Matt alluded to, trial and consumption are both up. Adjusted SG&A is flat, and operating margins are up 70 basis points, so great result. EPS is up 8% and free cash flow is a record at $544 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversions, 125%. That is a very important metric to the company. We'll be talking about that even more as we go forward, and that should be very important to every shareholder as well. So, why can we drive great cash flow productivity is because partly of working capital improvement. Our cash conversion cycle, which is inventory, which is receivables minus payables, has gone from 40 days to 27 days over the last five years. We continue to believe that we can continue to make that go down over time. Free cash flow conversions, 125% in 2015, average for the last five years, 119%; so just stellar result. We did dip our toe in the water in 2015 on AR factoring, so that isn't that 125%. If we take that out, we're still at 119%. So, as Matt alluded to, 118% for the last seven years or so, which is far above the industry average and far above some other competitors who target 90%. We have a strong balance sheet, 1.4 times levered. Why is that important? It's important because we have a lot of fire power, a lot of dry powder waiting to do an acquisition. In this example, we could do a $2.8 billion deal and maintain our credit rating. Okay. So that's 2015. So why don't we go through 2016. First, organic 3%. So, there's couple of things behind that number. So, that'll be SPD, 1% to 3% type of growth; International, 4% growth; and for the consumer business, domestically 2% to 3%. And you might ask why is that coming down from 3.5% in 2015? There's really two assumptions in there. One is, the international business comes back down to earth. We had a phenomenal year this year behind Steven Cugine and his team, 8% going to 4%, so back down to earth there. And then the categories, our assumption for that is growth of 2% to 3%. So if categories are doing better, then our top line will do better as well. Gross margin, 40 basis points of expansion. The easy way to think about that is really 70 basis points from productivity programs, from commodities, not having any of the start-up costs for York, for the vitamin plant, offset by about a 30 basis point drag from currency. And I'll walk you through it when we talk about currency a little bit more, but we have a 30 basis point drag largely because of transactional currency impacts from the U.S. to Canada. Marketing is flat, but there is a little bit more of a story there as well. SG&A is down 10 basis points, leveraging the top line, operating margins up 50 basis points, EPS, 7% to 9%, currency adjusted 9% to 11%. And then we have a share count number for you, 131 million, what's behind that, $300 million of buyback, and we've already gotten ahead ourselves of $100 million in December, so $200 million left for 2016. Okay. Here's how we stack up versus our evergreen TSR Model of 3%. You can tell we've hit or beat that 3% number over time. Focus on gross margin, absolutely 2010 to 2014 in the face of commodity headwinds, in the face of laundry competitiveness, we maintained our gross margin. In 2015, we expanded and we're going to expand again in 2016. Consistent marketing spend, so 12.3% to 12.3%. So, I just want to leave you guys with this comment. The core business we're increasing marketing spend by around 10 basis points, okay. Where a lot of our competition is cutting 20%, we're actually increasing our core business and the marketing spend associated with that. When we layer on the TOPPIK acquisition, it is a $30 million deal, about a third of that revenue is direct, so the marketing spend is a little bit lower. So when you do the math, it becomes 12.3% to 12.3%. SG&A management is the hallmark of the company. Our people do great things here. This is leveraging the top line, many companies do zero-based planning process, I'd say we've been doing this for many, many years. Operating profit, 2015 was a big year, we hit 20%. So, a lot of personal care premium companies are in the neighborhood of 20%. So we're happy to be there. And then in 2016, we think we're going to expand by 50 basis points again. Now, EBITDA is a good surrogate for cash generation and we think the stair step tells the Church & Dwight story very well; so we've gone from 20%s to the mid-20%s, 24.2%. For EPS, we're $3.48 to $3.54, that's the range of 7% to 9%. Again, once you back out the currency is 9% to 11%. Okay. Here's the FX story. So, in 2015, as a refresher, we had about a 2.5% drag in currency on the top line and a 4% drag for EPS. That was a 30 bps impact on gross margin. In 2016, we had a 1% drag for revenue and a 2% drag on EPS. But we still have a 30 bps drag from gross margin. And that might surprise you, I would just tell you that in 2015, 70% of the drag for currency was translation, and in 2016, 70% is transaction. So that's more of a gross margin impact. Okay, allocation of capital. Number one, by far, TSR-accretive M&A. We want to do the – we look at deals all the time. The management team, the senior leadership team, we look for deals all the time. You'd be shocked with how much time we actually spend on that. What I want to leave you with though is we're looking for the right deal, and it's number one, but we want to make sure it's the right deal. Number two is new product development that drives our organic growth. Number three is CapEx. Number four is return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buyback. And number five is debt reduction. We are not a capital-intensive company. In 2016, our outlook is really $55 million of CapEx. You might say, hey, Rick, you guys have typically been high-$50 millions, low-$70 millions. And I'd say, no, the base business was actually in the $50 millions. And then when we have incremental capacity to manage for vitamins or for a new plant, that's when we spike up to higher number. And then, as Matt alluded to, a 6% dividend increase to $1.42. That gives us right at our 40% payout ratio that we have been very clear on from many years. And with that, I'll welcome up the rest of the management team and we will take your questions.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay, do we have microphones for people? Oh. We do. Okay, Bill. (29:26)
Unknown Speaker: Thank you. As you highlighted both in the release and a couple of times, the kind of momentum exiting the year, can you just give us a little more color, and I guess particularly, do you see something in vitamins, as you finally get the plant issues behind you that you can maybe point to, where we have momentum going into this year? And also talk about the laundry category, with more competition with Persil, with – what you're seeing with XTRA? I mean, help me understand how you're seeing momentum as we move into 2016 for that as well.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So it's a typical multipart question.
Unknown Speaker: In one part, yeah.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So first off, so, vitamins. So, right, vitamins, we went sideways this past year. We had issues with supplying customers. We had poor service levels. We had a lot of people unhappy with us. We had – we didn't promote our products. We cut back on advertising, so – because we couldn't service customers. That is behind us now. So now we have lots of new products coming out as I reviewed with you. Customers are jazzed about it. And we're going to get new products on shelf in 2016. So, we're going to benefit from the tailwind of the category starting to grow again. So I feel really great about vitamins. What was your second one? Second was...
Unknown Speaker: Laundry.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So laundry, so look, laundry down three years in a row. And now, suddenly we had three quarters in a row where the laundry category is growing. So there is more money being spent on laundry, so consumers are willing to spend a bigger pot of money. So that's good news. When a category expands, you're right in that there is new competition in there with Persil. That was certainly not something we saw coming, as was into the category us having then OXICLEAN premium laundry detergent. But you know we're not giving up on OXICLEAN. We have obviously the new two variants coming out this year with the preserve product, and also the pods – the dual chamber pods, and don't underestimate that. So remember, we had a powder pod for many years. We focused on liquid, and we didn't put a lot of effort behind the pod side of the business. We're coming out with a dual chamber this year, because consumers are looking for multiple benefits, and you need multiple chambers. So, we think the innovation is going to help us there. With respect to unit dose, there is no question that Procter has dominated that, same story, right. We have a new product this year, the dual chamber and that's going to help us. Yes. Let's go on this side, Bill (31:58)?
Unknown Speaker: We talked a little bit on it briefly, but could you guys do a better job bridging the gross margins, so the puts and takes this year, because it sounds like there was a like a fairly significant hit from the vitamins stuff? But just given where the commodities are now and probably some mix lift from BATISTE and acquisition growing much faster. I know they're small, but they are massive gross margins. So how are you going to, like, get into 40 bps for the guidance?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I've completely forgotten everything about that I've learned in finance. So, I'm going hand this off to...
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Right, right.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: ...our CFO, Rick Dierker.
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, thank you, Matt. Well, we tried to illuminate for you a little bit, Bill, (32:35) about the transactional drag of 30 basis points of it. While commodities – the core commodities like resins, surfactants and paper are all down, that's a tailwind of course, other costs are still up, transportation and labor and everything else. So, everyone wants to talk about the pure commodity piece, but other costs still – there still is inflation in the business. Mix of BATISTE, yeah, that's helpful, Personal Care margins, and they are down. And like you said, vitamin costs are behind us. We never really quantified that. We said it was about the size of a breadbox is the quote. So by and large, it's really – commodities do benefit us. Productivity programs do benefit us. Mix does benefit. But there are some other headwinds like FX and everything else I just said. Okay.
Unknown Speaker: Okay, great. And then just to follow-up on the vitamin stuff. You did like 3%-plus or minus growth last year in scanned channels, how much do you think you lost because of the capacity outages and the allocation? And now you got it fully up like you can sort of support all the orders you're going to get now with the new supply chain, and maybe what you think that sort of 3% goes to?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean you'd assume that if the category grew 3% in 2015, at a minimal what we lost is we're going to hold share, all right? So, that would be our surrogate for that.
Unknown Speaker: Got it. All right. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Let's go, right here, second row.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Can you comment on vitamin margins. So, versus the average as you get the vitamin business growing again and you're investing, is that actually a negative mix shift that would be affecting gross margins and so on?
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So, Caroline, it's a good question. Remember, a year ago, we told you that we had actually got our vitamin margins up to the corporate average. That was prior to the investment of the new plant, right. We said, hey, we're going to invest all this capital and fix the right structure for all this future growth. 75% increase in capacity, and we have to grow our way into it over a few years. And so as we grow into our way into it, the margins for vitamins are again below the company average. But we think that with the growth over time, then we'll get back to or above company average.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you. And if I might just on the international, if you could, there have been some markets that are – where the consumer is very, very weak. Is your business small enough that you can still grow in that environment overseas?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Steve, do you want to take a swing at that one?
Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation: Yeah, sure. I would say that our business in developed markets has been quite strong actually. So, Europe delivered strong high-single digit domestic growth behind launch of new products, BATISTE, Femfresh. Emerging markets has been something where we've really performed well and you saw from Matt's chart, Mexico in particular is a good sub for us, that's double-digit growth. And then export markets, an area that we really focused on has delivered double-digit growth as well. So, we are feeling pretty confident relative to international playing a strong contributing role in the company's overall growth rate.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: So, Jason, you look like you have the mic. So...
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: That's – you got the power.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks. So, obviously, your operating margins are best in class. So, when you talk about aggressive but achievable guidance for 2016, the balance between sales and EPS growth, how can you – I guess, what are some of the levers you can kind of lean on in case sales do come in little bit lighter because of the macro backdrop. I know you got the recession kind of part of the portfolio. But this is a question that we ask you every couple of years when things start to look a little gloomier out there. But I was just wondering if, as you continue to impress us with the margins, like, how do you think about the next levers that you can lean on.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, we always have the same answer to you by the way, because you have asked this before. So, it's always a what if. So, what if there is some pressure on the top line. Well, obviously, it's always, we know where all the discretionary costs are in the company. So, even with the 12% SG&A, that's always something you can reach for. So, that's always the first stop on the train. And that the last stop on the train is going to be marketing. So, as you saw in the release, our marketing spend was $417 million in 2015; and a year before it was $416 million. So, we did not cut marketing this past year. On a reported basis and on a local currency basis, it went up. So, we're very committed to holding the marketing where it is, but as seen it would be the first stop on a train. And you know we have a very creative supply chain organization as well that's trying to find ways to lower the cost per unit. Go to Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for the question. So, two unrelated questions, first, good to see innovation on the unit dose front. Can you possibly frame and maybe you don't want to comment, what the trajectory of that looks like? So, Matt, you've made the comment in the past that you intend to get your fair share in unit dose. So, over what period of time should investors sort of expect to see that? And then unrelated question for Rick, you commented on free cash flow conversions. You guys have done a tremendous job on that. What's the runway there? How long can you guys maintain free cash flow conversion like a 115%, maybe even north of that like you did this year? Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, with respect to unit dose and our share today is 2.6%. We said okay, what's your share of ARM & HAMMER today of the total category, it's a 9%. So, clearly we're away under index there. Now, in some accounts, we have a five share, and other accounts we have a zero, we're voids. So, obviously, it is possible to grow, and in some cases, we're already at 5%. As far as the crystal ball goes, it's very difficult to say what the trajectory is, going from a power towards dual-chamber, we think is going to be a big help to the brand. We'd probably be better able to address that question in six months or nine months; let's see how successful we are with the dual-chamber.
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: And in terms of free cash flow and the runway, so same way we have TSR model for the P&L, I feel like we have kind of an operating model for cash flow generation, whether it's working capital or CapEx, whatever it is. So, I'd say, if – the pure operating model organically for the business, we have years of runway. But the good thing about Church & Dwight and the acquisition platform that we are is when we buy businesses, we just don't have synergies from a P&L perspective, we have it from a working capital perspective too. So, as long as we buy businesses and that's our strategy, then the runway is going to be there for a long time.
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Kevin, I'd like add – build on something that Matt said. So, I don't want anybody in the room to think we're taking our eye off the liquid business. So, we will continue to support the liquid business moving forward. But as Matt articulated, we're putting a lot of emphasis on building our share in the unit dose. So, I think that should make you happy. I know that's one of the questions you asked me for real. And so, but I don't want you to think we're taking our eye off the liquid business either.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. You pick, Joe. How about, Joe?
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just going back to gross margin for a second, what are you baking in in terms of the promotional environment, particularly in laundry and litter, for example, which is a category that you've done very well? And how do we think about the quarterly progression this year, because your competitors get tougher, but the transactional impact of that, that should ease as well?
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, so on a promotional perspective, right, promotional spending is pretty consistent with the year ago. But remember in Q4 this year, promotional volume for laundry, for example came down from 36% in Q3 to 33% in Q4. So, that we believe the trends are going to be pretty consistent year-over-year for both laundry and litter, nothing surprising in other competitive launches, but we have competitive launches as well. And the other one was transactional currency, and just timing of when that's – it's as you would expect, it's probably more front-half weighted, because currency rates, spot rates are pretty much unchanged now versus what they were in late Q4. So, it's more front-half weighted than back-half.
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, even though the competitors get tougher throughout the year, you think you see more expansion in the back-half on the gross margin side?
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Oh!, for gross margin...
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah.
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: I thought your conversation was more on the top line. So, gross margin, it's pretty actually balanced throughout the year. We're going to – we said called an expansion in Q1. So I'd tell you gross margin is potentially pretty balanced throughout the year.
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And just one quick one on the balance sheet, the inventories were up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter?
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Right. No doubt. Working capital was phenomenal. I think your cash conversion cycle was down to 26 days, inventory was going the wrong way. Part of that is our vitamin business, right, and we want to make sure we're not cutting customers and our fill rates are 99.7%, but we've probably over-corrected there, but over time, we'll bring that back in line, but for now it's great where it's at.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Joe. This side. And then, you can pass it down to Lauren when you're done.
Unknown Speaker: Sure. Maybe. Can you talk a little bit more about the distribution slide. I thought that was a great slide, and I didn't realize actually that you had gained that much distribution for something like liquid detergent. Can you tell us kind of, maybe for detergent and cat litter and vitamins, those are the three categories I care the most about, what inning are you in? How much more distribution expansion is there to be had? And then sort of related to that, particularly on vitamins, the innovation is awesome, but the trade-off is the rest, that there are too many SKUs on the shelf. So how are you managing that and what's retailer response been? Are they giving you enough shelf space to take all of that assortment?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: I am going to let Lou comment on the distribution gains, because he does take a bow for that particular slide and Lou will tell you that the game is never over and we're always in the middle innings.
Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales: No, thanks, Matt. So first of all, I'd like to answer by saying, it's a team effort from everybody, all functions. It really helps a salesperson when you're out at retail and when you have great innovation to sell against. Secondly, supported by a marketing team that really believes in the products that we have. If you put that combination together and a great sales team, and you deliver the results that Matt showed on that slide. All the modules aren't done and completed yet in 2016. But we are expecting very similar, there is nothing – the ones that we are hearing about are all positive and in line, that we have. But I really would put my hat off to everybody else at this table, because it requires all of us to work together to get those results.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And the other part of your question was vitamins. So, yeah, you're right, it's a very crowded space. And, obviously, as I said before in 2015, we didn't get any new products on shelf because of our own issues. But the retailers are very excited about us when you're the number one brand. So we have over 30% share, both in adult and in children's gummy vitamins, that's all outlets. We have the ability to a get product on shelf. And so, if you have the innovation, you're going to get the shelf space.
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, one thing to add on that. So if you remember last year, it was difficult year for us with the start-up of the plant issues that we had. And we took a very measured approach to 2015 that being, as you know, vitamins is a category that's highly promoted. And so, since we're having trouble supplying to retailers, we cut back on some of those promotions in 2015, that we would put back in in 2016. And so also when you're having trouble supplying the customer, no one is looking to really expand on your distribution base, right. So we have those opportunities – missed opportunities from 2015 that will be carried into 2016. You saw the innovation platform that we have for 2016 and we feel very confident on that.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Lauren.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. So just following up actually on vitamins and this would apply to OXICLEAN as well. Sometimes I think when you launch new products, clearly your P&L structure can afford a lot, but I am curious the cost of keeping things on shelf, when I look like in the Nielsen data at some of the vitamin products you've launched over the years, the different variants beyond like the basic multivitamin, they kind of get shared then they lose it, right? And that's been a pretty repeated pattern when you look at the sort of not SKU-by-SKU but the title-by-title in the Nielsen data on vitamins. So what's the cost to keep stuff on shelf when it's not really felling through? What pressure are you under from retailers to get it out, and get something new and the same would go for OXICLEAN. So when the retailers where 20 basis points of share gain this will be starting year three, how easy is it to keep it on shelf when you're at those share levels?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Lou, you can add to this but I want to give you some color with respect to vitamins. So, when you think about vitamins, there are lots of different variants. It's lots of different vitamins, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, et cetera, and there is also some specialty vitamins as well. Multivitamins in general, round numbers at 40% of the vitamin category, so that's sort of your anchor. So that one is the one you pay the most attention to. And it is common knowledge within the company that you can have a lot of SKUs which drives the supply chain guys crazy that need to be on shelf because some consumers are looking for them. So that is the way to think about it. And yeah, you're right. Some things cost money to get on shelf; you may have to pay slotting, et cetera. We do have a process that meets monthly, just SKU rationalization team, so we're always looking at these and say okay, is this something we should take off-shelf. And in 2015, we did eliminate a half a dozen SKUs for exactly the reason that you're pointing out. Anything you want to add to that, Lou?
Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales: The only addition would be that this is a category where you have to stay on trend, and so we continually innovate in this class, in this business. We will continue to do so. So you do need a good mixture of the base business that Matt talked about and continuing to add productive ideas that are on trend, and deleting some non-productive SKUs as you go forward. On OXICLEAN, you asked an OXICLEAN question, I would step back and provide this input because there're a lot of really good things; I think, we all should feel terrific about. Those being as Matt showed, the category is growing again, right so first time in a while that's happened. Second big thing is that, there are two new premium products in the category. That's a good thing for a couple of reasons, one being it promotes healthy competitive environment; and two, it allows us to build our business. And last year, if you remember on OXICLEAN, we said we would incrementally spend against that brand, and we did, and as Matt showed on his slide, our consumption is up 25%, our trial is up about 50% and our repeat purchase is up about 40%. So although it's a difficult environment because consumers are used to buying for over 50 years one particular brand, we believe in our brand, we will continue to support that brand moving forward.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then can I get one more on the M&A?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sorry. Thanks. No one took the microphone.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It was on TOPPIK, and I guess when you showed the list of acquisitions, the two that don't get mentioned in the recent past would be I guess FELINE PINE and then REPHRESH and REPLENS from last year. So just, I guess one, a big picture question on M&A. When you set out to look at these brands be they tuck-in or big scale, do you have a vision for whether or not you think they're going to be a power brand one day, right. So like BATISTE – or BATISTE and FELINE PINE the same on day one and BATISTE just really worked and FELINE PINE less so. Like, are there roles that the different acquisitions are meant to play when you bring them in? And then where would TOPPIK kind of fit in that continuum?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, okay. So SIMPLY SALINE, so we acquired SIMPLY SALINE a couple of years ago. For those of you who don't know, that's a nasal hygiene product. And keep in mind that we have the number one nasal hygiene product in Europe, that's called STERIMAR. So we thought, hey, you know we know a little bit about this category. It's not only successful in Europe, but it's successful in export markets. This is a pretty safe move for us to move into nasal hygiene. Now, has it caught on in the U.S. the way it is in other countries? No. But it's a high margin business, no plant came along with it, so we thought okay this makes some sense for us. FELINE PINE, it was a number one or number two natural cat litter that was really in vogue at the time. When we looked at it, we said, hey this looks like one that might make some sense for us, again no plant, it's co-packed. So we had the criteria and we had – it was a solid brand that one hasn't taken off. But when you buy it, when we're looking at trends to see does it make sense, you mention REPHRESH and REPLENS. So a year ago, we buy REPHRESH and REPLENS. So this is the number one gel, vaginal moisturizer, people with that issue will look high and low for a product that's going to solve their problem. So, again problem solution brand. We put some money behind that as soon as we bought it and it's grown really nicely in 2015. So we're real happy about that acquisition. And coming back to TOPPIK again from solution, we learned a lot about the hair category through BATISTE. We're not going to get into be a shampoo company, liquid shampoo, but we feel really good about hair thinning and that is an issue that you don't have a good solution there, because today the big brand in hair thinning is ROGAINE, it's a J&J product and it's putting chemicals, right. And if you look at the consumer research, people aren't happy with what offerings are out there to solve the problem. And we think TOPPIK, if you go online look at Amazon, some of the reviews for their product, people love it. And this business has people that have been customers for 20 years. So again, it's the kind of thing we say, hey this looks like a really solid brand. It's not going to go backwards. It's going to grow quite a bit and again asset-light, high margins, throws off a lot of cash.
Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation: Matt, can I add something to that.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure.
Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation: For each acquisition, we really do a deep dive and look at what the global opportunities are. So when you look at something like FELINE PINE, we know that's really a domestic U.S. play period, and does it work with the portfolio that we have. I'll take out BATISTE as an example or TOPPIK. TOPPIK, a third of their sales are in fact in international markets with good overlay over what we do today and it complements our capability to deliver in specialty Personal Care Products. I would say, REPHRESH, REPLENS internationally off to a very good start as well. Again, we do a lot of a doctor detailing, for example in international markets. We feel that's a great product for us. We have a great way to access those markets and educate doctors on the benefits of these great products. So, we have a model per acquisition in terms of where we think we can play and how to win.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay, it's a good add. One more up here.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks for taking my question. So recently in the news has been more negative commentary following the PBS documentary on vitamins and supplements. Just wanted to get a sense of whether you guys have seen any impact on your business related to that?
Steven P. Cugine - Executive Vice President Global New Products Innovation: Well, you know what the results were for this past year. We went sideways. I think the only way to react at that is just to look at what happened to the category. It continued to grow in 2015 and it's growing in the first quarter. So I would say, no, then – by the way that has generally been the reason why the category has flattened out, because there was a lot of press in 2014 and you saw up on the screen today it flattened out that year with the category.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And the second question on the BATISTE. You highlighted in your slide an opportunity to expand with your top retailers this year. Just want to get a sense of what your penetration is currently with those retailers?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: With these top retailers?
Unknown Speaker: Yeah.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Next to zero for some of them. So when I said we had a 15.2% share, that's going to grow in 2016. So we have voids in other words.
Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales: So I'll add to that. So clearly when we bought BATISTE, it was more of an International opportunity, and so there is kind of a reversal what Steve said where we're all looking at it globally, but it started more in out of states and we bought it to United States about 18 months ago. We're very pleased to say within the United States that we became the number one dry shampoo brand in the United States in that short window of time. And that's been through a constant charge from our group and our team across all functions to deliver the best products out there which we think we have and there's a lot of distribution opportunities still in front of us.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Here's another fun fact for you is that, remember we said that the retail category for dry shampoo is $90 million in 2015. In 2014 it was $60 million. So it's grown significantly year-over-year. Anybody else? Jason (54:53). Oh...
Unknown Speaker: Sorry. Jason (54:55), I'll come back.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: You're the next.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you, guys. Thank you for the question. Congratulations on a strong finish to the year. I want to come back to the gross margin questions we had earlier. Pricing appears to be a dramatic swing factor in your resumption of gross margin growth last year where the first time in many years you reported positive price growth. You kind of closed out the year with a little bit of price leakage. What drove the price leakage into the year? As we think about moving into 2016, what should we expect in the price line of the P&L?
Rick Dierker - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I wouldn't characterize it as – so here's the story on price. If you think back, Q4 year ago was when we started saying it was normalized pricing environment in laundry. So Q1, Q2, Q3 on paper looks like favorable pricing year-over-year in 2015 versus 2014, but that was just the normalized pricing environment. So in Q4, there wasn't – you're comping a time period that didn't have any pricing difference. So in general I'd say, 2015 versus 2014 was the absence of the competitiveness in the pricing laundry category. 2016 as I said earlier, I think, it's going to be very comparable to 2015.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Steve?
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Just – you touched upon to some degree on OXICLEAN. You talked about how you're behind where you want to be one share or just over. I think last year you'd said you want to be at two. So I'm just trying to figure out where you are in that arc and how much additional commitment in terms of trade or spending behind that brand we should expect as we track it in 2016?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Well as we've said, we're not going away when it comes to OXICLEAN. So as you know in the second half of 2015, we took some money out of marketing and put it up in the promotional spend area, do wanted to promote trial. We're going to need to continue to do that in the future. Does that help you?
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: It does. So, we should expect that to continue on?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We're going to need to do that, definitely.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then, are there other pockets of – should we expect, I'm assuming, those are going to get additional promotional support, maybe vitamins as it comes back. Are there pockets where we should be expecting and looking for year-over-year increases and integration?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Well, typically we're going to put the muscle behind the new products. So some of the new products you saw up today, generally, their first quarter is our lowest marketing spend quarter and it picks up in Q2. So we move marketing around depending on where our new products are landing.
Louis H. Tursi - Executive Vice President-North America Sales: Yeah. It would be incorrect to walk out of here to think that our promotional spend is up year-over-year and is essentially flat year-over-year. All the commodity benefits are now being piled back into price issues in the category.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Caroline?
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Hi. You talk about this BioEnzyme product formulated to meet Safer Choice. Can you elaborate on what that is? And is there are any pressures from environmental group store, any sort of ingredients that look to be under pressure right now?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We have somebody who's been waiting for that question for about 45 minutes now and that's Paul Siracusa, our Head of R&D.
Paul A. Siracusa - Executive VP-Global Research & Development: Thank you. The Safer Choice logo or label is an EPA designation. There's plenty of green or partner organizations out there that try to certify the safety and efficacy and environmental compatibility of products. The EPA has a program used to be called design for the environment. It never gained a lot of traction because the consumers didn't have a clue what it was for. So they repurpose their whole program. They went on and talked to consumers, and then came back with a Safer Choice approach, which means all the chemicals in there have to be certified by the EPA to be best-in-class from a consumer toxicity, from a environmental toxicity, and biodegradability perspective. So you have to formulate to those targets, and that's we've done with the BioEnzyme product. So we wanted to go after efficacy with the BioEnzymes. So it's an enzyme-based product that does great cleaning and strain removal. At the same time, we did it with materials that meet the EPA's Safer Choice program.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: And are there opportunities to do this in other brands that you have?
Paul A. Siracusa - Executive VP-Global Research & Development: You could do it across the line if you want to formulate to these targets. And what we're doing inside the company is we're looking for where those opportunities make the most sense because ARM & HAMMER is a safe brand to begin with. So differentiating safer and safest is a difficult challenge, as you can imagine, but we took this approach because we added enzymes into the ARM & HAMMER franchise, which were never there before.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: And I'm just jumping topic to last question. On vitamins, and gummy vitamins, private label is a big sector in that category, is there any other category where you compete with the private labels as big and how do you do things differently just in the face of private label?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean with respect to private label, the way to compete with private label frankly is your features and benefits. So if you keep your features and benefits different than private label, you're going to be able to command the premium and we do compete in private label and lots of categories. So for example in baking soda, 25% is private label, the cat litter is for high-teens in private label. So we're no strangers to private label. And by the way in vitamins it's pretty stable. It's been around 12% of the category. Okay. Well coming up on – Bill (01:00:30), did you have one more important question? Your last question, so make it a good one.
Unknown Speaker: Well since you did that, I will turn it to Britta since you're new. Can you just talk, actually as you're looking since you're new to the role, what you're looking at in marketing and advertising and actually from a cost standpoint. Is there any changes in terms of TV versus print versus digital which you're doing differently. So as we look into marketing spend being kind of flat year-over-year really there's some savings that you're actually getting, can you may be talk about your approach and then costs?
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Britta before you answer, let me just introduce Britta. So, Britta Bomhard is our EVP of Marketing. She's Chief Marketing Officer for the company. She just joined us earlier this month. Bruce Fleming lead a stellar career with Church & Dwight, retired at the end of 2015. And Britta comes to us from our European business. So she ran our European operation, which is most 37% of the International business with fabulous results. And you can tell the folks a little bit more about your background and then help Bill (01:01:39) with his question.
Britta Bomhard - EVP Chief Marketing Officer: Hi, guys. Well, thank you. So I think coming back to that question, I am three weeks into the job. I'd say it's a little bit early or you can tell if you look at the results that we've seen, very successful with the approach we have. And I would like to compliment my predecessor, Bruce Fleming, on the kind of parameter he had set up, very clear longevity on brand assets and on communication. Yeah. So I would say, this isn't broke. This is a winning formula we currently have. Obviously, we all look at ways of optimizing. I will do that in due course, but currently I would say it's a winning formula. There's no reason to upset the apple cart, it's not a nice American expression.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Very nice. You got that our of our – your book this morning, right...
Britta Bomhard - EVP Chief Marketing Officer: Yep. American-isms.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: Okay. And just to build on that, I think one of the things was a kind of side question is what are we spending on digital and has that changed much over the years? And it has, but we were around 26% in 2015. We'll be a little higher, 27% is what we're targeting right now. So it's about a quarter of our spend. Going back a few years, five years ago, it was less than 10%, so we're moving in that direction.
Matthew T. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer: I want to thank everybody for coming today. We're going to wrap it up. We're about an hour now, and we'll talk to you again at the end of the first quarter, and we'll see you again next year at the exchange. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, especially when we have great results to report. I'll start off the call by providing you with my perspective on our third quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and soon to replace me as Chief Executive Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year, and then we'll open the call to field questions from you. You should also know that Rick Dierker is here with us today, who replace Matt as CFO in 2016. Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the third quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued soft U.S. consumer demand and weakening foreign currency, the Church & Dwight team built upon our momentum in the first half of this year and continue to leverage our innovation-driven strategy to deliver strong business results in the third quarter 2015. This is exemplified by the fact that our organic revenue growth of 3.2% in Q3 was the sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth above 3%, even though we are now lapping high organic growth levels of 5% achieved in the back half of 2014. As I have stated on previous earnings calls, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over 25% of our domestic sales so far this year came from new product launched in the past five years. In 2015, we launched new products in every one of our major category. Some of these new products, like our new premium price cat litter called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL, have become a huge hit with our consumers as reflected in both the brand's share results and its impact on category growth. We first launched the new ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter products in 2014, which drove a 23.5% increase in our consumption and grew our share by 290 basis points to a record share of 22.9%. In 2015, we built upon this success by launching a new lightweight version of the CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. This product is also off to a great start. Our total ARM & HAMMER cat litter consumption in the first nine-months of 2015 was up 15% and our share grew to a new record of 24.0%. This share growth in 2014 and 2015 has enabled our cat litter brand to grow from number three brand in the category to a strong and growing number two brand. And this growth help drive the cat litter category up 8.6% in the first nine months of last year on top of the 8% growth in 2014. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote to driving improved value creations for our consumers, customers and shareholders. Our goal is to continue launch innovative new products to drive share gains and category growth in all the categories in which we compete. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to give you specific details on our third quarter results.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Our third quarter reported EPS was $0.90 per share compared with $0.85 in 2014, that's up 5.9%. The $0.90 was better than our $0.87 to $0.88 outlook for the quarter. And netted in our $0.90 is 4.7% drag from FX year-over-year. Reported revenues were up 2.4% to $862 million. Organic sales were 3.2%, exceeding our Q3 outlook of 2%. The organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic (04:17 – 04:23) is due to volume with 1% positive product mix and pricing. Now, let's review the segments. The consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 2.8%, driven by the continuous success of our ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal cat litter franchise, including the new lightweight variant. Also, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and higher sales of VITAFUSION gummy vitamins and BATISTE (04:50 – 04:52) Out of the 2.8% organic sales growth in the domestic business, volume growth contributed approximately 1.6% plus to 1.2% effect of positive price. We continue to expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2.5% for the consumer domestic business. Now, let's talk about international. International organic growth was up 7.9%. Volume increased approximately 6.9%, and we had favorable product mix and pricing of 1%. We had strong growth across Australia, Canada, Mexico and Europe, and in particular, our French team had a spectacular quarter with success with BATISTE. We now expect the full-year organic growth to be approximately 7% for the consumer international business. Now, we'll talk about specialty products. For our specialty products division, organic sales was down 2.2% with volume declining 1.4% and unfavorable product mix and pricing of 80 basis points, driven by a difficult comp of up 22% a year ago. We said in May that SPD would come back down to Earth, and it has. Currently, the U.S. dairy industry is still healthy, although milk prices have declined from an average of approximately $23 in Q3 2014 to approximately $16 in Q3 2015. The good news is that corn and soybean are also down, and the dairy industry continues to be profitable. Our comps are very difficult in the second half of this year. Remember, last year Q3 and Q4 were both 20% up quarter. We now expect the full year to be approximately flat for the Specialty Products Division. For the total company, we continue to expect organic sales to be approximately 3% for the year. Now, gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 44.8%, a 110 basis points increase from a year ago. The Q3 gross margin benefited from four factors: lower trade spending as we had a more normalized pricing environment in the laundry category; productivity programs; lower commodities; and a higher margin from our acquired businesses. These factors were partially offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix, and incremental costs associated with our new vitamin capacity at our York plant. For the full year, in August, we called 25 to 35 basis points of gross margin expansion. We now expect a range of 35 to 45 basis points on a full-year basis. Now, marketing. Marketing spend for the third quarter was $92.8 million or 10.8% of revenues, which is 70 basis points lower than the prior-year spend rate, largely driven by shifting some marketing funds through trade and coupons to continue supporting consumer trial generating activities for the OXICLEAN megabrand. For Q4, our expectation is for marketing to be flat year-over-year. Our full-year expectation is approximately 12.3% of sales or down 30 basis points, primarily due to the previously mentioned OXICLEAN megabrand investment shift. Now, SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.9%. That's an 80-basis point increase from the prior-year third quarter. This was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquisitions, higher incentive compensation and research and development spending. Our full-year expectation is for SG&A to be flat as a percentage of sales. Other income and expense was $4.9 million, which is largely interest expense of $7 million. With respect to operating profit, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.1%, which was 100 basis points higher than the prior-year third quarter. Next is income taxes. While quarters may be uneven, our effective rate for the quarter is 35.2% and that's higher than our full-year expectation of 34.5%. The Q3 rate is higher year-over-year, primarily due to the year-ago benefit from an IRS settlement. Cash flow is next. We generated $408.8 million of net cash for the first nine months of 2015 and that's in line with the prior period. We have invested $44.7 million year-to-date in CapEx and continue to expect to spend approximately $70 million for full-year 2015. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $585 million and free cash flow to exceed $515 million. In conclusion, the third quarter highlights are 3.2% organic sales growth, 5.9% EPS growth, which equates to 10.6% currency neutral EPS growth. Now I'm going to talk about the fourth quarter. Remember, our previous outlook was for the second half top line to grow 2%, we still believe that. With Q3 growth of 3%, we expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1%. For context, if we want to look at this on a two-year stacked basis; Q1 would be 5%; Q2, 8%; Q3, 8%; and then the coming Q4, 6%, as last year we had a 5% organic growth quarter. And (10:23 – 10:25) we expect gross margin to expand. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.79 per share (10:33 – 10:36) and remember we had 20% EPS growth a year ago in the quarter. Now, I'm going to wrap and talk about the full year to summarize our thinking. We continue to expect 3% organic sales growth and full-year gross margin expansion of 35 to 45 basis points. As we work our way down the P&L, we now expect marketing at 12.3% of sales and operating margin expansion of 65 to 75 basis points. As far as other income and expense, excluding the impairment from earlier in the year, other income and expense is higher by $6 million or approximately $23 million expense in 2015. The full-year adjusted EPS range is now 7% to 8%, that's inclusive of a 4% drag from currency. And I want to remind us that we started the year with a 7% to 9% EPS outlook and a 2.5% currency drag. The currency drag has been growing all year long. In May, it grew to 3%. In August, when we spoke to you, it was 3.5%. And now, it's 4%. So, that's a total of $0.06 of higher EPS drag than when we started the year. So we've raised our currency neutral midpoint to 11.5% in August and we're affirming that today. Back to you, Jim.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Matt. Before I open the floor to questions, I'd like to provide a few additional highlights on our third quarter business results in our key categories and business units. As you know, we continue to sharpen our focus on our four megabrands: ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, Trojan and our vitamin business, which each cover multiple categories. These four brands represent over 60% of our company's sales and profits and have achieved the most growth over the past five years through delivering a bigger bang for every dollar of marketing investment than smaller one-category brands. In 2015, we plan to spend over 80% of our media investment on the four megabrands. This investment continues to pay off as we achieved share growth on two of these four megabrands through the first nine months of 2015 despite aggressive competition. The ARM & HAMMER megabrand had an excellent quarter with total consumption up 5%, driven by its laundry detergent and cat litter products. I previously mentioned the excellent cat litter share results for the first nine-months of 2015. The specific third quarter results continued a strong momentum of this business as consumption grew 15% and our share increased 150 basis points to a record 24.0% share behind the new Clump & Seal product line. ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent also had a solid quarter of growth, driven by its liquid laundry detergent which achieved its highest ever quarterly share and its 23rd consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth. It's important to mention that the total laundry detergent category grew 2.6% versus a year ago in the third quarter, the second consecutive quarter growth after three years of category decline. This category growth reflects two factors: first, a return to more normalized pricing environment and second, that the category has now absorbed most of the unfavorable impact of the launch of the unit just formed by our competitor. Hopefully, the laundry category will continue to grow in future quarters as it historically did driven by category-building innovation and a normalized pricing environment. We now can talk about other products and all the categories covered by the ARM & HAMMER megabrand. The ARM & HAMMER carpet deodorizers achieved its highest ever quarterly share of 53.9%, up 420 basis points versus year ago. All in all, a great quarter for the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, which is our largest megabrand with over $1 billion in annual sales. Next, the OXICLEAN megabrand, who share is up 20 basis points in the first nine months of the year. This megabrand's third quarter dollar share was down slightly. However, the brand's two biggest forms, OXICLEAN powder and OXICLEAN liquid laundry detergent achieved share gains. OXICLEAN's share of the $1 billion stain fighters category, its original category, increased 230 basis points to 46.0% which is greater than the combined share of the next five brands in the category. OXICLEAN liquid laundry detergent, which was first launched in the first quarter of 2014, grew its sales over 20% versus year ago and achieved its highest ever quarterly share. Our third megabrand, the Trojan brand, had a solid quarter as all three segments of this megabrand grew. The Trojan condom business achieved its second highest quarterly share in the past five years at 76.4%. In the total condom category, the top 12 SKUs all belong to the Trojan brand, and 25 of the top 30 SKUs are also Trojan SKUs. Other forms in the Trojan megabrand also had a solid quarter. The Trojan Vibrations line of products grew its share by 310 basis points to 58.0%. Our Vibrations line now has the top 3 SKUs in the category. And finally, the Trojan lubricant line first launched in February 2013 grew its share by 30 basis points to 7.7%, making it the number three selling brand at lubricants category. While the condom category is relatively flat, our Vibrations and Lubricant categories are growing at high-single digits, far above the average consumer products business category growth rate. Last but not least is our newest megabrand, the gummy vitamin business, which we bought in October 2012. This business consist of two brands; L'il Critters for kids gummy vitamins and VITAFUSION for adult gummy vitamins. Last quarter, I reported that despite strong demand for our gummy vitamin business, sales actually declined in the second quarter, primarily due to self-inflicted supply constraints, involving the slower than expected startup of a new production line in our York, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. I'm pleased to report that our gummy sales grew over 7% in the third quarter as production rates and customer service levels have significantly improved. In addition to our four megabrands, we had a great third quarter of some of our higher margin power brands. Our First Response pregnancy kit brand achieved a record quarterly dollar share of 32.9%, up 250 basis points. Church & Dwight has been the number one manufacturer of branded pregnancy kits for 43 consecutive quarters. And our NAIR depilatory brand achieved a record quarterly share of 60.9%, up 450 basis points. NAIR has been the number one depilatory brand for 44 consecutive quarters with 7 of top 10 SKUs in the category. I'd also like to highlight some great news on our dry shampoo brand called BATISTE. We purchased this brand in the second quarter of 2011, which at that time, was the number one dry shampoo in the UK. We have now expanded the brand to over 80 countries, and next year, it'll become our next power brand with projected sales over $100 million. In the U.S., BATISTE is the fastest growing dry shampoo brand with sales up over 100% this year which propelled it from the number seven rank dry shampoo, to the number two rank in the third quarter. While dry shampoo represents only 3% of the total shampoo category in the U.S. The dry shampoo sub-category is up 34% year-to-date, while the bigger wet shampoo sub-category is up only 2%. Going forward, we plan to leverage the double-digit growth of the dry shampoo sub-category through new product innovations and increased marketing support. To drive the dry shampoo sub-category to at least where it is in the UK at 9% of the total shampoo category three times the current market share in the U.S. This is another great examples of Church & Dwight's successful acquisition strategy in which we can make even a relatively small acquisition with unique consumer benefits and quickly turn it into a strong contributor to the profitable growth of our company. Overall, a very solid quarter for our four megabrands and several of our power brands. I'll finish off, our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year. As I stated in the press release, we are maintaining our 2015 guidance on organic sales growth and improving our guidance on gross margin. We are not changing the midpoint of our currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth for 2015 of 11.5%. You might question why we're not raising our targets in view of the strong results in the first nine months of 2015. We simply do not feel comfortable of doing at this time for several reasons. First, we had an incredibly strong organic sales growth of over 5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, so we have to comp over those results. And second, if we do have additional earnings upside we will invest it in incremental marketing to enable us to support stronger share growth in our four megabrands behind our new product innovations as we exit 2015. In summary, we feel confident in delivering our annual targets which are in the top quartile of EPS projections that in our industry consistent with our historical performance. The achievement of our targets will be driven by a resilient portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products across every one of our major categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management overhead costs. I also want to assure you that we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions and a significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions because we are very selective of the types of businesses we acquire and very aggressive how we integrate them into our existing business. That ends our presentation. I'd now like to open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey. I'd like to start, so you guys put up a slide, I guess, in late September at an investor conference and took the top line algorithm down to 3% from 3% to 4%, understanding that you hadn't put that slide up in Ohio. But can you guys touch a little bit on industry growth, how your view – I guess three different components, really. Talk about industry growth, ability to gain market share, and then maybe a little bit of the tougher M&A environment with respect to multiples and given the long discipline that the company has had, the inability to close some of these deals and get accretive organic deals done?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And, Kevin, it's Jim. I'd answer as follows: Industry growth as far as – I can talk in category growth – is actually ticking up a little bit with probably one of the best quarters in a long time in the sense of how many categories of the 14 we compete in grow. It's not huge, but it's a nice little incremental growth. So I feel somewhat positive despite all those somewhat negative signs you read about the economy these days. So I would say at this point in time, I would not worry about the industry growth and maybe it's getting a little better. Share growth, hey, we always feel good about that. I mean, we've got great new product pipelines this year. Next year, I feel extremely good about our new product pipeline. Marketing spending, we've shaved it a little so far this year, but nothing near what everybody else has shaved, when your revenue (21:39) like Colgate has cut 23% of their marketing. Our share of voice is still very high, and we feel very confident we'll continue to grow share out there. And M&A environment is – if you read a lot of stories, I would just tell you, we're very active. I'm not worried about competing on price for the right acquisition out there. But always – the story is finding the right acquisition that we believe has all the factors that we want to see in acquisitions as far as having strong growth potential, a higher margin than our corporate margin, the asset-light net. So, we are continuing to scour the minefield for those kind of acquisitions, and I don't worry about price.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. All right. That's helpful and just one for me. Maybe touch a little bit on the decision, so A&M comes down modestly, not a big deal but I guess the decision has been made to reallocate some of that to trade promotion. Can you talk a little bit about that decision?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Kevin, I would just say that A&P spending, if you adjusted it for FX in Q3, we spent equal to a year ago. And again, that's a hell of a lot better than a lot of our competitors who cut their A&Ps significantly to cover problems like foreign exchange. And in Q4, the marketing spending will be the highest level of smart marketing spending for the year. So, I feel very confident that it will propel us to some good strong share gains in the fourth quarter and next year with strong momentum. So, we have kept marketing up much better than I believe many of our competitors, have been able to keep our share of voice. And it should lead to very strong share results going forward.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Hi, Jason.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. I guess, I was just wondering if you can give us maybe a little bit of a sneak peek into next year. I'm sure you're going through all the budgeting now and want to get to the fourth quarter. But can you talk maybe, I guess, two things in particular, about the core business, if there's anything out there that you think might get a little bit better, worse, versus what you've seen this year. And then, maybe tie into kind of currency, how that's positioned into next year? Just – I know this year you're saying kind of a 4% drag to the bottom line, but how we should be thinking about that for next year?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Hey, Jason. This is Matt. So, as you know, our model, as Kevin pointed out, is for revenue growth of 3% and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion annually, and we're going to keep with our past practice of giving our outlook in February and then a line item outlook at that time, too. But as you know, there's always pluses and minuses so, take one of your points, currency. So, the EPS drag this year was 4%, but that was actually muted by FX hedges that we got out in front of. So, actually the FX hurt this past year would have been 6% if not for actions that we took before the year started. A year ago, things started getting pretty volatile with currencies. On the plus side, the vitamin business is coming around, and we expect the vitamin production difficulties not to repeat in 2016, so that's a plus. I'm sure that's on some people's minds as well. But if you wanted to estimate what the – what would the FX drag be for us next year, we'd say probably 2% to 3%.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. No, that's good. Yeah, I do know you wait until February, but I just figured this was on the topic of mine. The other question, and maybe we could just talk a little bit about laundry and maybe specifically just about OXICLEAN at the high end, and certainly we've seen a little bit more. I mean, I know you're saying the environment is more rational, and I do agree with that. The high end, kind of the bigger player out there, I think, is doing a little bit more responding to the new guy in town. So, I was just wondering how that affects OXICLEAN. Is that where some of that promo spending might be going on that brand? And then how does that really affect to the consumer? I know the high end and the low end are different, but usually when there's gaps in terms of the price to the consumer, do customers kind of see that or are they kind of just mutually exclusive?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Hey, Jason. This is Matt. You probably – if you got the Nielsen data, you know that the OXI liquid laundry detergent was up 8% in consumption in the third quarter. And we had lots of successful promotion in Q3. In fact, it created some out-of-stock situations with some of our retailers. And consequently, if you're looking at the Nielsen's, you'd see lower ACV, that's purely because of out of stock. So we made a decision that we wanted to get behind OXICLEAN. When you enter a new category, you're always going to find a lot of competition. And as you know, the OXICLEAN has been growing its share throughout the year, but it's tough sledding. So with respect to the pricing, it's a 20% discount to Tide -Tide which is top end of the brand of the tier. So, naturally, we have somewhat of an advantage there. When you mention Henkel coming into the category, naturally Persil is – started out at Walmart and Amazon earlier in the year, and now they're going to be rolling out to other retailers. So this is a good time for us to get behind the brand.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate the color.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Bill.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, how big is BATISTE and how big can it be? Because I've talked to some industry folks and it seems like it's got like software margins on it.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: What kind of margins?
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Software.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're not going to comment on the margins for BATISTE. When we bought that business in 2011, it had $25 million in trailing net sales, and as Jim said, we think that this thing can be $100 million, and that would be not just – it's growing significantly outside the U.S. right now. It's very small in the U.S., but we're the number two brand, and we started a year out as the number five brand. So we've been growing like a rocket.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Bill, I would just say the gross margin is well above the company average, and we're gaining distribution left and right. So this is a super hot brand we have, and it's very hot in those consumers out there, and we feel very positive about the growth of this brand. It's just a little monster for us, I would call it.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Awesome. And then I started to belabor the laundry point, but like it seems there's a huge disconnect now between people's share of shelf and their share of market, so like how long does it take to make those adjustments if some of the stuff doesn't kind of work as planned? And then where does XTRA kind of fit in? Because everything else is going great, but it seems like it's been a couple of years now where XTRA is just kind of find out where it fits in, and it seems like they've been linked to one of the biggest share donors in the category.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Bill, your comment on share of market and share of shelf is very interesting. For example, Persil just lost this year to Walmart. They initially got 19 SKUs. Our analysis would show only 2 or 3 of those SKUs would survive long tier, the rest of them all in the bottom quartile of SKU performance. So as they roll out, they're going to have to justify hard why they have any more than 2 or 3 SKUs as they go out based on their performance at Walmart. XTRA's got a little bit of a hard year. We have plans in place to restore growth on that brand. We still believe it's a very strong part of our franchise. It still hangs in around a five share, which is a very meaningful player in the category, and we've got some new product performances, new products from non-XTRA I think will revitalize growth of XTRA.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Hey, Bill. It's Rick, Bill. The only thing I'd add on XTRA is, yeah, share is down, but sales and profits are up. So, we're not repeating some of those cheap trade deals we had a year ago.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just one last quick one. Do you know when will the commodity favorability peak for you guys? I'm trying to figure out like when does all of this stuff kind of like flow to the P&L?
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Yeah. It's been flowing through this year. One of the reasons why we're taking gross margin up for the full year from 25% to 35% to 35% to 45% is because of the commodity favorability.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: There aren't going to be four more quarters to that afterwards.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. But are they with the top of the bell curve or are we still on the upward slope?
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: No. I think we're peaking.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: We're not going to be seeing a whole lot of year-over-year favorability next year.
William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Good morning.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. First on the Q4 organic growth guidance. Obviously, Q3 came in better than we expected, but you're only looking for 1% in Q4 and I get that the comp gets a bit tougher, but the deceleration in Q4 versus Q3 is a bit more than that. So, was there – is there anything that pulled forward from the fourth quarter or is that potentially just some conservatism? And then – I'm sorry I jumped on late, but on SG&A, can you just give a little bit of color on what drove that increase there? Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Olivia, on the Q4 organic, keep in mind, as you said and we noted the – we're comping a huge number a year ago of 5% and a fair part of that number was driven by some increased promotional spending in the laundry business. So, the whole category has kind of pulled back on that. Hey, look, if we wanted to beat 1%, we could easily put more money into the trade line and drive a bigger thing, but we don't want to upset what seems to be a much more normalized pricing environment in laundry category right now. So, we're very happy to deliver the 1% on top of the 5%, which as Matt said, if you stack it on the two-year basis is a very small number. Don't view that all to deceleration of our business. It is not, we've got a great new product pipeline for next year and we're going to be coming out with kind of, we're not calling the number now, but quite a historic type of organic growth rate as we have in the past, we feel very confident about that. On SG&A, I'll turn it to Matt.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. On SG&A, we started the year saying we were going to get 15 basis points of leverage on that line item as percentage of sales. And now, we're saying flat, two reasons for that, and one is R&D spend and the other is just our incentive comp. So it's pretty simple.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Good morning. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Hey, Bill.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Bill.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Jim, I know you love these calls so much. Is this the last time we're going to hear from you for retirement?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. You kind of spoiled my closing there. But this is my 45th and last quarter of the earnings call. And as you all know, Matt will be replacing me as the head of the company, but I'll stay on as the chairman. I will just tell everybody it's an honor and a privilege to be the CEO of this great company, and I've enjoyed most of the time communicating with you over the past 11 years. I'd also tell you that I strongly recommended Matt as my successor and I have total faith in his ability to continue the great results. And I put my money where my mouth is because the large portion of my personal wealth is tied up with Church & Dwight stock and I intend to keep it that way. So I would just say thank you to everybody. I'll be around, you may see me hanging out at some Analyst Conference once in a while as they give on free food. And otherwise, I've got a great team here between Matt and Rick taking over the company. And we also appointed a new chief marketing officer last week. So we got a great team for the future.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: That's great. I enjoyed working with your and didn't mean to preempt your closing. But it actually ties into my next question of in terms of P&G, I mean, Jim, you've seen over the years the biggest competitive changes have been – have occurred when there's been a new CEO at P&G. What's your initial take or what are your – what's kind of the expectations with the CEO change of how the competitive landscape might play out over in laundry over the next six months?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, that's an interesting question. But I mean, I don't think it will change that much. In fact, it's like we've referenced a few times already today, it seems like the laundry category is getting back to more of a normalized pricing environment, which we really think it's the right way to go and drive the categories through innovation. So, that's the way we're going to play the game. We got great new innovations next year. I think the CEOs who are all taking over at Procter has taken over, and Matt and gang all have great experience in the laundry category, are smart enough not to do stupid things and start trade wars that have nobody benefits from. So, I think you got a bunch of very smart characters who understand the business and understand that innovation is a key to it. And now we've had two straight quarters of growth in the laundry category, which are very positive. So I certainly hope everybody understands that, and I think certainly we do at Church & Dwight here. Matt and Rick understand that well, and I think it bodes for good things going forward in the laundry category in my opinion.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. Great. And then, Matt, just on the vitamins, so the thought that vitamins are kind of back on growth trend and there are less kind of category issues, and then can you maybe quantify what the total expense of kind of the start-up costs were to this year which we'll be comping through next year?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: I can help you with some of that, Bill. I don't know about the last one. To give everybody some context, we had operating difficulties with the new plant and the contractors in Q2. Our sales were down for vitamins. We had some retailers on allocation. Had some out of stocks and pulled some promotions. So we're pretty much in the penalty box. And today, I'm happy to report that our fill rates for the last six weeks are over 95%. Production rates are up, our product quality has improved, and importantly, we have growing interest on the part of the retailers (35:43) new products looking ahead. So it's – things have turned around for us. As far as quantifying, Bill, we wouldn't take a swing at that.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: All right, I got to ask. All right. Well, thanks so much. And, Jim, congratulations. I enjoyed working with you.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks.
Unknown Speaker: (36:09).
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: In terms of M&A, you guys have obviously been pretty active over the last few years. But recently, something that was (36:17) of the smaller variety or should have – there's a way for you our megabrand strategy to some extent. So as you think about M&A going forward, is it still your preference to do bigger acquisitions or you're more comfortable with the smaller, sort of tuck-in variety?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Joe, I would tell you we're ambivalent toward it because it always just depends on the right deal. What we mentioned today, BATISTE was a relatively small acquisition and now it's quadrupling in size. It's growing like crazy. So we don't mind that. And because we're still a relatively small player in this category, a small acquisition like that can have a great meaningful impact on our bottom line. And, hey, if a big one comes along that fits our criteria, we will do that too and we have the firepower to do it. We can do a $1 billion-plus acquisition. We have that money in the tank. So I – trust me, we have been working hard. We're scouring the landscape for both small and big, but we're not going to just do a big one so we can pound our chest and do what I saw – Cody today bought a business down in Brazil. I mean, I sometimes can even not (37:17) understand some of the prices my competitors pay, and for what I don't consider to be the highest quality stuff, but we're not going to do that. We're not going to do an acquisition to say we've done an acquisition, or do a big one just to come up with some big numbers. We'll find – we've got a great history of finding the right acquisitions, big and small. They've all been winners, and that's the goal. And we are – I can only tell you we are working fast and hard on that constantly to find those acquisitions.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just one last one on vitamins, and I apologize if I missed it. But in terms of your manufacturing, obviously, with the capacity expansion, do you guys have a cost advantage today versus your competitors from a manufacturing standpoint? And did you guys gain back any shelf space you might have lost with regard to the disruptions from last quarter?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I wouldn't say that we have a competitive advantage from a cost standpoint because remember, we expanded capacity 75% and we're still significantly under that, take us years to fill that up. So obviously, we have fixed costs that we're going to have to absorb over time. So, I wouldn't go there, Joe, from a cost perspective. What was the second part of your question?
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: In terms of the shelf space that you guys might have lost with regard to the production issues you had last quarter.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, the shelf space that you saw, if you look at the Nielsen's for Q2, the reason why it looks like we lost points of distribution, which Jason pointed out on the last call, is because we had out of stocks. Out of stocks, when you're sold out, you show up as not having distribution. Because we're filling those back up, if you look at the Nielsen's now, you'll see that our points of distribution have grown. As far as getting new shelf space, when you're in the penalty box, you're not going to get a lot of new shelf space for new products. As I said before, the retailers are showing growing interest now, because our fill rates are back up and we're a good supplier, they're showing growing interest in our new products for 2016.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: And Joe, I would just remind you, we have a much bigger vision for the gummy business than just vitamins. We actually hope to take that business into other OTC categories in the future and build that, we're working on that. It takes a lot more effort because of greater FDA regulations in some of those businesses, but it's not a gummy vitamin business, it's a gummy business. And we hope to take it in a lot of different directions in the future and the capacity we have enables us to do that.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks, guys and congrats and good luck, Jim. Take care.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Oh, hi. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Good morning.
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Quick one on price mix and consumer domestics. So it was flattish in the first half of the year and it jumped up about a point sequentially here in Q3. And I thought you mentioned there would be some investment behind OXICLEAN this quarter, and it sounds like you're now talking about that in fourth quarter. Did some of that maybe get pushed back? Is that a timing issue? And how do you see price mix evolving going forward here? Do you see it positive? Thanks.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Yes, so price mix – this is Rick, Joe. Price mix in Q3 was favorable, around a point, and that's largely because of those deep trade deals we didn't do as we're comping a highly promotional environment in Q3 and Q4. So, I think long term, it's still the same algorithm for us. It's largely volume, but this quarter or next quarter as we're not comping some of those trade deals we do have some benefit of price.
Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Cool. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Jason.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm here. Sorry. I was a little bit slow today. Lots going on. But hello, Jim. I wanted to circle back on the questions on top line, many of which have been asked one way or another, so I'll regurgitate. I apologize for some of that. You mentioned OXICLEAN laundry momentum growth this quarter. As we look at the track data, the syndicated data, it actually – the trend line is kind of down and to the right, with fairly sharp declines in the last month. Can you give us a little more context? Is it fair to say that's just sort of the hangover impact of more aggressive promotions earlier in the quarter and that should normalize in a forward? And secondly, on vitamins, we know you have some out-of-stocks, 7% strong growth. Is that reflective of how we should expect to think about that business going forward, or was there some replenishment restocking benefit in the quarter?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Jason, I'd say yes and yes to your questions. Yeah, OXICLEAN, it was just the last four weeks was just an all-promotion period. We've actually been gaining distribution on OXICLEAN laundry detergent out there, and the promotions have been helping to drive that. So, we feel very confident that brand is building momentum, doing well. And the vitamin business thing, which is your second question, that business, Matt – let Matt jump in.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Jim quoted a number – sales being up 7.8%. If you look at consumption in the quarter, Jason, it's 4.9%. So, there is a bit of an imbalance in Q3, and it was reversed in Q2.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: One more – thank you for that. One more quick follow-up. We obviously look a lot at the Nielsen data because it's the only data we have. Is there anything unique happening outside of that data in terms of distribution wins, et cetera, that we should be cognizant of as we think about interpreting the data going forward?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I don't think I'd say it's – since you had an interest in OXICLEAN, it's that we're picking up two new retailers in Q4, and that should start scanning at some point in Q4.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good stuff. All right. Thanks, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Jim, congrats, and, yeah, good luck in your next endeavors.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'll see you in the beach.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Wish I was heading there, too. Consumer international, a question there. The business has been quite strong, essentially volume driven year-to-date. I think you've guided to something like 6% growth for the year, but you've been trending quite a bit stronger than that. Can you talk about, number one, kind of the underlying kind of volume dynamic in that part of the business and what's driving the kind of upper-single-digit growth you've experienced? And then is that – are we going to see – should we expect to see a drop off from here, or is that kind of sustainable as we look out over the next few quarters? Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. The business, actually in August, we called 6% full-year organic growth for international. So we raised that to 7% today. And as you know, we have a collection of different businesses. We have a European business, Canadian, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, a small business in China. They all have very, very different dynamics. In Mexico, we've been doing a terrific job in pushing ARM & HAMMER laundry down there. In Europe, we have three brands; BATISTE, Sterimar and femfresh, which have been real horses for us, and we're doing just a terrific job with those PC brands. So this is somewhat country-by-country specific, but we've been competing extremely well in difficult markets. As you probably know, there's been consolidation in the retailers in France which we've been combating and still finding a way to grow. We're going to be calling 7% organic next year for international unlikely, but I'll still say we'll give everybody guidance on that in February.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Craigie for any closing comments.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, again, thank you very much. Kind of sentimental. This is my last earnings call, and I got a great team taking over. At this point forward, if you want to go down to the beaches in Florida, you'll see AG (45:23), myself and Don Canales (45:24) enjoying a fruit Corona moment. I just hope we drink the bottles instead of hitting each other with them. So, anyways, it's been a pleasure, folks, and great talking to you. Take care. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, especially when we have great results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our second quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and soon to be my replacement as Chief Executive Officer. Rick Dierker is also with us today, who we announced this morning as Matt's replacement as CFO. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year, and then we'll open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the second quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued soft U.S. consumer demand and foreign currency, the Church & Dwight team built upon our momentum exiting 2014 and continued to leverage our innovation-driven strategy to deliver strong business results in the second quarter and first half of 2015. This is exemplified by the fact that our organic revenue growth has averaged above 4.5% for three of the past four quarters. As I stated in our previous earnings calls, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over 25% of our sales so far this year came from new products launched since 2008. In 2014, we launched a record number of innovative new products across every one of our major categories and three new categories. In 2015, we launched fewer new products but our new launches covered every major category. Some of these new products like our new premium priced cat litter called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL have become a huge hit with our consumers as reflected both in our brand's share results and its impact on category growth. In 2014, our cat litter consumption increased by 23.5% and our share grew by 290 basis points for a record share of 22.9%. This enabled our brand to move from the number three brand in the category to a strong and growing number two brand. Just as important, our new product was a major contributor to driving an 8% increase in the cat litter category in 2014 – the strongest annual growth in any of our categories and an excellent growth for any CPG category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key antidote driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. In the first half of 2015, we built upon this success by launching a new light-weight version of the CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. This new product is also off to a great start. Our total ARM & HAMMER cat litter consumption in the first half of 2015 was up double-digits almost 15%. And our share grew 130 basis points to a new record share of 24.1%. And this growth helped drive the cat litter category up 8.8% in the first half over last year. Our goal is to continue to launch innovative new products to drive share gains and category growth like this in all the categories in which we compete. Overall, the second quarter results were excellent on the share front, (03:43) with share growth on two of our four mega brands and flat share on the third mega brand. And I'll turn the call over I'll now turn the call over to Matt, to give you specific results on our second quarter results.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.55 per share, and that compares with $0.65 in 2014. The reported results include a couple of charges: a pension settlement charge of $0.05 that we discussed during our Q1 call and an impairment charge of $0.13 associated with the company's investment in Natronx, which is a joint venture that we entered in 2011 related to the specialty chemicals business. The details related to these charges are in the press release. So, adjusted for these one-time charges, EPS would have been $0.73 or a 12% increase over the prior year, driven by strong organic sales. The $0.73 was better than our $0.70 outlook. And of course, netted in the adjusted $0.73 is a year-over-year drag of $0.03 from FX. That'd be 4.6%. So, if you add those together, it equates to a 16.9% currency-neutral EPS quarter. It's a good story. Our reported revenues were up 4.8% to $847.1 million. Organic sales were 5.1%, which exceeded our Q2 outlook of 3% to 4%. And the organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. And of the 5.1% organic growth, approximately 4.5% is due to volume, with 0.6% positive product mix and pricing. Now, I'm going to go through the segments, first the U.S. business. The consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 4.7%, driven by the continued success of our ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal cat litter, which includes a new lightweight variant. Second would be ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, which is up significantly in the quarter. And finally, OxiClean laundry detergent. Going the other way, we had lower year-over-year sales of vitamins in the quarter. We have been living hand-to-mouth in 2015 as demand has exceeded capacity and retailers have been put on allocation. We've experienced untimely production difficulties at our existing vitamin plant and lengthy startup difficulties at our new plant. On a positive note, in recent weeks, the new plant is coming online. And the new plant is expected to expand our capacity by 75% once fully ramped up. Back to the macro story; of the 4.7% organic sales growth in the domestic business, volume growth contributed approximately 4.5% plus 0.2 – 20 basis points effect of positive price net of negative mix. We continue to expect full year organic sales to be approximately 2% to 3% for the consumer domestic business (06:46). Now I'm turning to international. International organic growth was up 9.6%; volume increased approximately 7.3% with favorable product mix and pricing of 2.3%. We had strong growth in Europe, Mexico and our export business, largely driven by the success of our Batiste and Sterimar brands. We now expect the full year organic growth to be approximately 6% for the consumer international business. Turning now to specialty products, organic sales was virtually flat, down 10 basis points, but in line with our expectations, driven by a difficult comp of 22.9% a year ago. I said in May that SPD, the Specialty Products Division, would come back down to earth in Q2 after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Volume decreased 80 basis points and was largely offset by favorable product mix and pricing of positive 70 basis points. The U.S. dairy industry is still healthy, although milk prices have declined year-over-year from an average of approximately $23 in Q2 2014 to approximately $16 in Q2 2015. The input costs, corn and soybean, are lower as well. So, the dairy industry continues to be profitable. Comps are very difficult the rest of the way this year for this business. Remember, last year Q3 and Q4 were both 20%-plus growth quarters. We now expect the full year to be approximately flat for the SPD division. For the total company, we continue to expect organic sales to be approximately 3% for the year. Now, we'll turn to gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 44%, a 10 basis points decrease from a year ago, but largely in line with our flat expectations for the quarter. Q2 gross margin benefited from four factors: our higher-margin acquired businesses, productivity programs, lower couponing, and lower commodities. These factors were more than offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix, and incremental costs associated with the new vitamin capacity in our York manufacturing facility as the start-up phase has lasted longer than anticipated. For the full year in May, we called 25 basis points to 35 basis points of gross margin expansion. We continue to expect that range in 2015. Now, marketing. Marketing spend for the second quarter was $115.8 million or 13.7% of revenues, which is a 30 basis points decline from the prior-year spend rate, but a $2.4 million increase on a dollar basis. Our full-year expectation is still approximately 12.5% of sales. Now, SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13.5%, a 50 basis points increase from the prior-year second quarter, which includes an $8.9 million pension settlement charge. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.5%, a 50 basis points decrease from prior-year second quarter as we held SG&A dollars flat while growing the top line. Our full-year expectation continues to be 15 basis points improvement in SG&A year-over-year. Other income and expense was $22.8 million, negative for the quarter, which includes a pre and post-tax impairment charge of $17 million associated with our investment in Natronx. As mentioned in the Q2 earnings release, Natronx is a joint venture that is engaged in the marketing and distribution of sodium-based, dry sorbents for air pollution control in coal-fired electric utility and industrial boiler operations. The charge is worth $0.13 of Q2 EPS and primarily a result of lower-than-expected demand for dry sorbents as a result of continued delays in the implementation of federal regulations. Adjusted other income and expense was $5.8 million negative for Q2; that's a $2.5 million year-over-year hurt. Now, we'll turn to operating margins. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 16.8%, which was a 30 basis points climb from the prior-year second quarter. Adjusted for the pension settlement charge, operating margin was 17.8%, which is 70 basis points higher than the prior-year second quarter. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 38.3%, which, again, includes the previously discussed one-time items. Adjusted effective tax rate was 33.1%, which is lower than our full-year expectation of 34.5%. While the quarters can be uneven, we continue to expect the full-year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%. Now, we'll discuss cash. We generated $248.4 million of net cash for the first half of 2015; this is a $42 million increase over the prior period. We have invested $34 million year-to-date in CapEx and continue to expect to spend approximately $70 million for full-year 2015. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $570 million and free cash flow to exceed $500 million in 2015. Before I get to the second half comments, I'd like to make a few remarks. Last year, we posted 5% organic growth in the second half and 100% of our year-over-year EPS growth. So it was a backend loaded year in 2014. This year, we have more of the reverse, with higher organic in the first half and 60% of our full-year EPS in the first half obviously due to easier comps. Our most difficult revenue and EPS comps are in the third and fourth quarter. Now, I'd like to comment on the third quarter. We expect Q3 EPS of approximately $0.87 to $0.88 per share compared to $0.85 per share last year. That's a 2% to 4% increase, which includes a 3% drag from FX. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 2% on a tough comp of 4.7% growth in Q3 2014. Last year in the third quarter, third quarter was a highly promotional quarter. As a result, our share of laundry peaked at 14.7% but our year ago gross margins were depressed. We expect the continuation of a more normalized promotional environment which we've seen on the first half of 2015 continue for the rest of the year. We expect higher gross margins as a result but potentially slightly lower market shares in Q3. With respect to the full year, to summarize our thinking, we continue to expect 3% organic sales and full-year gross margin expansion of 25 to 35 basis points. As we work our way down the P&L, we continue to expect marketing at 12.5% of sales and expect SG&A leverage of 15 basis points, resulting in operating margin expansion of 50 to 60 basis points. Finally, other income expense line excluding the impairment will be approximately $20 million expense for the full-year. The full-year adjusted EPS range remains at 7.9% inclusive of a 3.5% drag from currency, and the midpoint of our range would deliver 11.5% currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth for 2015. Just to wrap up on the second quarter, the highlights for the second quarter are as follows: 5.1% organic sales growth, 8% EBIT growth excluding charges, and 12.3% adjusted EPS growth. Back to you, Jim.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Matt. Before we open the floor to questions, I'd like to provide a few additional highlights on our second quarter results in our key categories and business units. As you know, we continue to sharpen our focus on our four megabrands: ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, Trojan, and our vitamin business with each cover multiple categories. These four brands represent over 60% of our company's sales and profits, and we've achieved the most growth over the past five years due to delivering a bigger bang for every dollar of marketing investment than smaller one-category brands. In 2015, we plan to spend over 80% of our media investment on these four megabrands. This investment continues to pay off, as reflected in my earlier statement that we achieved share growth on two of these four megabrands in the second quarter. The ARM & HAMMER megabrand had an excellent quarter with total consumption up 7% driven by its laundry detergent and cat litter products. I mentioned the excellent cat litter share results earlier for the total first half. The specific second quarter results continue the strong momentum on this business as consumption grew double-digits and our share increased 110 basis points to a record 24.3% share behind the new CLUMP & SEAL product line. ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent also had a solid quarter of growth. But before I talk about the growth of our laundry business, it's important to mention that the total laundry detergent category grew 1.4% versus year ago, the first quarter of growth in over three years. This category growth reflects both the return to a more historical promotional environment and, second, that the category has now fully absorbed the unfavorable impact of the launch of the new unit dose form by all competitors. Hopefully, the laundry category will continue to grow in future quarters, as it historically did, driven by our category-building innovation and a more normalized promotional environment. In terms of our specific laundry business, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a 10.4% share in the second quarter, up 60 basis points versus a year ago, the 22nd consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth. As a total company, our three laundry brands achieved a 14.5% dollar share of total laundry detergent in the second quarter, up 40 basis points versus year ago. As a total company, we have grown share year-on-year in the laundry detergent category in 20 of the last 21 quarters. We do not often talk about other products in all the categories covered by the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, but ARM & HAMMER carpet deodorizers achieved its highest ever quarterly share of 53.8%, up 570 basis points versus year ago. All in all, a great quarter for the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, which is our largest megabrand with over $1 billion in annual sales. Next, the OXICLEAN megabrand had a solid overall quarter. The brand's total dollar consumption was up, driven by a 20% gain in consumption of the new OXICLEAN laundry detergent line, which was launched in the first quarter of 2014. OXICLEAN's share of the $1 billion stains fighters category, its original category increased by 80 basis points or 46.8%, which is greater than the combined share of the next three brands in the category. Our third megabrand, the Trojan brand, had a solid quarter, as all three segments of this megabrand grew. The Trojan condom business achieved its second highest quarterly share in the past five years, at 76.4%, up 40 basis points versus year ago. In the total condom category, the top 13 SKUs all belong to the Trojan brand, and 26 of the top 30 SKUs are also Trojan SKUs. Other forms in the Trojan brand also had a strong quarter. The Trojan Vibrations line of products grew its share by 160 basis points to 55.3%. Our Vibrations line now has the top 3 SKUs and 5 of the top 10 SKUs in the category. And finally, the Trojan Lubricant line, first launched in February of 2013, grew its share by 40 basis points to 7.5%, making it the number 3 selling brand in the lubricants category. While the condom category is relatively flat, our Vibrations and Lubricants categories are growing at high-single-digits, far above the average CPG category growth rate. Last but not least is our newest megabrand, the gummy vitamin business, which we bought in October 2012. This business consist of two brands, L'il Critters for kids gummy vitamins and Vitafusion for adult gummy vitamins. Despite strong demand for our gummy vitamin business, sales declined in the quarter due to self-inflicted supply constraints primarily involving the slower than expected startup on our new production line in our York, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. These supply issues have now largely been resolved and we expect stronger vitamin sales in the back half of this year. Despite the production constraints, our branded gummy vitamin business grew its dollar consumption by 4% in the second quarter, driven by a 9% consumption growth of our adult Vitafusion brand. Vitafusion continues to be number 1 adult gummy, with more than double the sales of the number 2 gummy brand. Overall, a very solid quarter for our four megabrands. I'll finish off our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year. As I stated in the press release, we are maintaining our 2015 guidance on organic sales growth and gross margin improvement. We're also maintaining our adjusted earnings growth target despite incremental foreign exchange headwinds. You might question why we're not raising our targets, in view of our strong first half results. We just don't feel comfortable doing this at the time for several reasons. First, we had incredibly strong second half of 2014, as Matt mentioned earlier, so we have to comp over those strong results. Second, we expect category growth rates to continue to slowly improve, but still be below our company's revenue growth target of 3%. Third, we intend to continue to invest marketing dollars to grow our four megabrands, and secondarily, our five other power brands behind our new product innovations to drive strong future growth. And fourth, we expect continued fluctuation in currency rates and needs reserves to handle those fluctuations. In summary, we feel confident delivering our annual targets which are in the top quartile of EPS projections in our industry, consistent with our historical performance. We still have six months to go, and in our opinion, it's just too early to get more bullish, given the ongoing uncertainty about the worldwide economy, currency rates and competitive activity. The achievement of our targets will be driven by our resilient portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products throughout every one of our major categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs. I also want to assure you that we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions and have the significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions because we're very selective about the types of businesses we acquire, and we're very aggressive on how we integrate them into our existing business. That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have which I, Matt and Rick will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Hey, Bill.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Just a couple of housekeeping items and laundry question. So when you said specialty sales are going to be flat for the year, is that organic or is that with the acquisitions?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: It's organic.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Good. And then why isn't the gross margin target a little more aggressive in the back half of the year? Just because it seems like if you look at the currency spot rates like the incremental impact kind of lessens but commodity flow through should be a little bit better on the pullback. Am I wrong in that calculus?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. That could happen, Bill. But as Jim said, to the extent that we beat our gross margin target, we're going to spend it back on marketing.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That is fair. And then, on the laundry side, it looks like OXICLEAN now is going to align price with ARM & HAMMER. Is that like a permanent price reduction, is that going to be the new price point for the product?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: No, Bill. OXICLEAN is not aligning price with ARM & HAMMER. OXICLEAN is priced above 20% below where Tide is. So it's up at the high end of the middle category or low end of the premium category.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I just look at that Nielsen data and it looks the average price per unit is identical now but maybe that's just promotional activity or something.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: It probably is just the short term promotional activity.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then one quick last one, on L'il Critters, do you guys think you need to find a licensing partner? Only because if you look where all the growth is coming on that gummy thing, it looks it's coming from guys who are licensing kids stuff.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: We do and we are.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'll stay tuned. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust, your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Hi, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'll just follow up on Bill Schmitz's question. I mean, in terms of the gross margin benefit and reinvesting it all in marketing, I mean, at some point, doesn't some of that need to fall to the bottom line? I mean, are you out-marketing your competitors by 3x, 4x? At what point is too much?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Bill, the way you can think about it is we said that unlike many of our competitors, we're keeping the marketing at 12.5% of sales. And obviously, the underlying metrics that you want to look at there is what's the share of voice versus share of market. So, we're always pretty vigilant about that. We have found historically that to the extent that we significantly over-index there, that we're able to drive growth. So, we're not focused simply on what number are we going to hit this year. We're trying to build the brand equity for next year. And as you know, OxiClean is a brand that we're trying to establish in new categories, and we launched it in 2014. This is our second year. So, that's an area – one brand that we would certainly pour on the marketing where we – were it to become available.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Bill, let me build upon that, too. While some of our key competitors are cutting marketing spending right now, we are not. We also – as last year, we invested going into the second half of the year. We exited with very strong momentum, and that carried over into the great results in the first half of this year. So, yeah, if we wanted to just worry about 2015, we probably could drop some upside opportunity that might happen into the EPS. But we're worried about 2015 and the future. And we want to exit this year with momentum and enter next year with momentum. So, we're going to keep that marketing spending up. And if we have additional dollars, we're going to pour it into it so we get off to a great start next year.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then just switching to the plant expansion for vitamins, did you – I might have missed it – did you quantify kind of what the top and bottom-line hit was in the second quarter from that? And then will there be any incremental hit in the third quarter, I guess, through July?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. We don't ever get into the weeds on sales or gross margins or operating income by product or segment, Bill. Some – I wouldn't go into that kind of detail. But with respect to the third quarter, yes, there's definitely some overhang into Q3 for these charges that we're going to be taking in the gross margin.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But was it meaningful or was it just a couple cents of EPS, or was it bigger than that?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. It's bigger than a bread box.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: They still delivered great results.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Your line is open.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Good morning and congrats to Rick on his promotion.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Thanks, Caroline.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Just wanted to – thank you. I just want to ask you about vitamins. It's feeling a little bit like the one acquisition that hasn't done exactly what you hoped. I mean, generally, if – generally, you want to be able to fold – I'm sorry. I don't know what that noise is. You want to be able to fold in production into your own plants. Generally, there's some good margin leverage, and this just feels like a very, very competitive segment. Can you tell us what you feel great about, about the vitamin transaction, and what the next year or two or three might look like for you?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Caroline, that's a pretty fair assessment. What we feel great about is, this has been and will continue to be one of the fastest-growing categories out there. And keep in mind that the adult vitamin category, which is about 90% of the total business with about, I think, it's $3 billion or, I'm sorry, $3 billion of sales, only about 8% of that category is gummy today. So there's huge upside to converting the adult vitamin world into gummies. So that's what we see, and honestly, in this case, we outsmarted ourselves. So we've tried to do a good thing in improving the quality of our gummies, and at the same time, we tried to build a real state-of-the-art production facility inside our plant in York, Pennsylvania, and we ended up screwing up both. And it was the biggest self-inflicted wound in my 11-plus year history as CEO, and because of that, we had some supply issues and lost some sales, but the good news is the worst is behind us. We're digging out of this very quickly. We got to deal with some upset customers and that, but we're dealing with that well, and this business still has tremendous, tremendous upside, and we still are number one out there in that. But it was just a case of a – we tried to do too much too quickly, and again I'll say we outsmarted ourselves, and – but we fixed it. We fixed it, and the problems are largely behind us going forward, and we have a great brand and a great upside opportunity on this business.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: So, thank you for your frankness there, but do you think the next couple of quarters we still see a drag from gummies then?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. When you say drag, are you talking about sales?
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Sales, margins, everything. I mean, everything.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah, look, on the sales line the way you should think about it, as Jim said, the total – the gummy category, so if you look at gummies within vitamins grew 14% in the second quarter. So that is a very healthy place to be. We are capacity constrained and we're coming out of that right now. So obviously, when you have a retail or some allocation, they're very anxious to – for you to survive that and start increasing your sales. So we've got plenty of new items coming. Obviously, we've been restricted with our ability to launch them, but we do think that it's going to take another quarter or two for sales to accelerate for vitamins.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then just looking at international, can you talk about what drove the strength a little more specifically? I think you mentioned Batiste? And then do you see any more likelihood of being able to find an international acquisition, maybe even just a tuck-in, than you're seeing...
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. The...
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: ...in the U.S.?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. The way you should think about international is that's somewhat front-end loaded. They had two terrific quarters, Q1 and Q2, and they're going to be more of a 2% grower in the second half. There were a lot of distribution gains that we got for Batiste. You hear us talking about Batiste quite frequently, not just in the UK, but in other countries as well. So, Batiste is a big puller there. And then our export business is – that can be lumpy, and sometimes your export businesses can be front-end loaded. So, we saw some of that in the second quarter. We got some order that won't repeat in the third and fourth quarter. So, I would say with Batiste, distribution gains, the export business, some timing there, and, of course, we did have some strength in Europe and Mexico.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And, Caroline, I would add, too, we've made some organizational changes over the past two years in the international organization. And now we just have a rock star organization out there that's delivering great results in both launching new products and execution at retail. So, I mean the results speak for them – almost 10% organic growth in some very tough markets like Europe where the guys are having a hard time. So, great organization, great new products, great execution. It's all adding up to some terrific results.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you. My last question is on laundry. And just to – you touched on – you said something very interesting. You think the negative volume impact of pods is largely over. I don't know how the Persil launch is affecting the category overall, but any more detail you can give would be really helpful.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Caroline. The laundry category was hurt by the pods launch. It's a great innovative new product, but it did lead people to using less laundry detergent. It's now stabilized at about 13% of the laundry category. Every competitor has launched their pods, so there's no more upside from new launches out there insofar as new brands going out there. You do know there was a very negative report that came out on July 16 from Consumer Reports, where they recommended that households with kids less than 6 years old refrain from purchasing the product. That's very, very recent news, we have not yet seen share results to show whether or not that's going to actually hurt the pods business. But we'll be watching that very closely as that was a very strong statement by the Consumer Reports organization which has a very powerful impact to consumers. We honestly are the – we don't have a liquid laundry detergent pod out there which is what's causing this issue. I will take the blame, I held the organization back on that because I was very concerned about the consumer issues going on out there. We do have less than our fair share of the category but we have plans in place to get up to our fair share of that category. But right now, the pods as a percent of laundry has stabilized. We have focused much more up to now on the liquid part of the category – liquid laundry detergent which is over 70% of the category. And I told you we've had great results. I think we've had share gains in over 21 of the past 22 quarters and by far the biggest segment. So that's kind of the story on laundry and we mentioned earlier too the promotional environment has kind of normalized back to historical standards over the past several quarters. So now you're getting up into the positive zone after several years of negative declines in the category, driven by the pods and by some overly aggressive promotional activities going on in the category. So I would say the future is looking much better out there. There are rumors out there that Persil is going national sometime maybe as early as the fourth quarter this year. We don't know any more than that at this point about what its impact will be in the category. But overall, I think the future is looking brighter for the category going ahead.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Hi, guys. Good morning.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: First again, I want to congratulate Rick as well, well deserved on that promotion.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Thanks, Joe.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Not to throw salt in the self-inflicted wound, but I'm not sure you guys gave the consumption number for L'il Critters in the quarter. I may have missed it.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It was down, Joe. It was down. We got attacked by, as mentioned earlier, some competitive product and license stuff, and we took a step back on it. But overall, our total growth, consumption-wise, was up in the vitamin category.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And how long do you think that will last for? Is that still something that you see bouncing back by year-end or...
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I don't want to make predictions on quarters, but we have plans in place to launch new products from that to restore growth on our share on that business going forward.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then switching gears to marketing, you mentioned you're keeping it flat at 12.5% of sales. What's going on in the gross to net line? Are you seeing increased or decreased trade promotion activity within your categories?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: As I've said before, Joe, we said that we have a more normalized promotional environment that we saw in the first half of 2015 as compared to the second half of 2014. Q3 last year was particularly rugged. So the transition going forward is one of the reasons why we expect to get some gross margin expansion this year was because of a more normalized promotional environment. And specifically, what you see less of is couponing. There's less couponing this year than last year in the gross to net line.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you. Okay. And just one last one, in terms of cat litter. Obviously, it's been a star for you guys. When do we start to lap the tough base periods in terms of category growth, or have we started to lap that category growth?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Joe. We're lapping it. We started lapping it in the second quarter of this year, so we're already doing double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth, and our product is just on fire. So we've had two years in a row now of great product innovation, both the base CLUMP & SEAL and our CLUMP & SEAL lightweight, and it has been awesome. And we've gone, as I said, from a number three player to a number two, passing the number two player who has two brands in the category. Our one brand is now bigger than their two brand. So that's again innovation, innovation, innovation, drive the category, drive your brand, that's the most shiny example we have out there of awesome growth in a very tough category. So it's just – we're very proud of that and we'll get – we're trying to put that magic on all of our businesses.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Hey, Jason.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jason.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Let me echo the sentiment. Congratulations, Rick, well deserved.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Thanks, Jason.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I hate to beat a dead horse, but I want to come back to vitamins and it sounds like a really unfortunate time to have some supply disruptions. You mentioned competitive activity heating up, service level dropping, and we're looking at some of the scanner data. Your distribution points have fallen 13% from the end of the last quarter. So it looks like you're losing shelf space at the same time that competition is heating up. What are the plans to get it back? And why should we be concerned that you're going to have some consumption weakness that's going to bleed for a more protracted period in the wake of this?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Jason, I would just tell you. Yes, we've had some hits to the business because of our supply issues. But we have some great new products going out. We've got strong marketing programs going out behind all that. And our customers have largely, very much hung with us. And we just had the wounds and we dealt with it. So, again, there's so much upside in this category. There's going to be growth. There's going to be growth in – and now you have almost every major player in the category launching gummies. That's all they're talking about is gummies. So again, you've got over 90% of the adult category out there to be taken. That's hard pills today over the gummies and everybody has validated that gummies are – as great as the hard pills. So I think we're going to get our fair share or more than our fair share with the new product launches we're bringing out and the brand support we have. So, again, yeah, I'll totally admit we had a short-term hit from this that was self-inflicted, but we have all the plans in place to get back on a growth trajectory for this business.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Good luck on that. Let me switch gears quickly to laundry. It's been a while since we talked about this, but compaction and the next wave was certainly the buzz over a year ago. It's died away. Can you bring us up to speed on where we stand in terms of compaction and where to advance what you think the impact would be?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'll answer part of that. Right now, the tentative plans in the industry, there'll be about a 25% reduction in water in the product in the next wave. There'll be a test nationally starting in Q4 of 2016, and there'll be national launches by 2018. Those are the tentative plans right now, and as we never have and never will validate the exact financial impact of that. Honestly, it's even too early to fully estimate that as we're all now in the phases of trying to finalize what I just told you means, and I'll be honest, we just don't know yet. It will not be as much as it was last time, and I won't tell you what it was last time, but it won't be as much as it was last time.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thanks a lot, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: But it'll still be big. It'll still be meaningful because it's our biggest business.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sure. Sure. Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess going back to international for a second, was the distribution gain that you had in the first half, was that – was that pipeline fill, and I guess I'm trying to understand the fact that the growth was obviously very healthy, very volume-driven, but you also haven't really been pricing a heck of a lot given the currency environment. So, are there plans to price more, and was that pipeline fill that's going to lead off in the back half of the year?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. You're right in that. There's some pipeline fill, obviously, any time you're going to be entering new markets. But we still do have same store significant growth. So I wouldn't throw a bucket of water on that. That thing is a rocket ship, it's continuing to grow. As far as price goes, we actually did get some price in the second quarter. So we have done some selective pricing around the international business. So if you go back to the release, you will see that. And I wouldn't expect like you say for Batiste to suddenly plateau. On the other hand, we expect that to continue to grow in 2016 and 2017.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's great. Okay. And I guess getting back to pods, how high a priority will liquid pods eventually be? I know Jim you mentioned the Consumer Reports article that's going to hit. I mean, are kids eating them enough of an issue to limit your investment in that category? Is that really what's setting the strategy?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. I would say, we're watching this current – again, brand new news of several weeks ago has an impact on the category. But I fully believe pods will be here to stay. The industry is taking actions to deal with these issues and we fully expect to be a full-time player in the category. And again, we're safe from any legal issues right now with the liquid pods situation because we're not in liquid pods. But we have plans in place to build our business going forward. I just don't what to, for competitive reasons, get into what those details are.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Got it. Thanks. And I guess last thing, just on gross margin bigger picture, right? Obviously, you guys have generated a huge amount of gross margin over time from high 20%s, right, to mid-40%s. Given it's a very competitive environment, it has been for the last few years. But it's kind of flattened out, right? So as you think forward in the next one, three, five years, can this company be a 50% gross margin business? And if so, how do you get there? Does it have to be more of a product mix issue? I mean, will we see you guys premiumizing it more? Does it have to be more of an M&A story? But I'd be curious for your longer-term thoughts on that. Thank you.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yeah. I would tell you, yes, we've flattened out in the last year, year or two, but that was a pretty – a lot of our competitors went backwards. So, actually, we absorbed a lot of hits out there from a time period of higher commodities and foreign exchange, everything else going on. So while our performance has been flat, that's actually been better than competitors. And I do believe we can get up to a 50% gross margin in this business. It'll be a combination of launching new products with higher margin, continued productivity gains and acquisitions. And it is our goal to get up to that point in time, and I'm not going to give you a timeframe we believe in that, but I do believe that's very doable.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: So first question on M&A. Anything that you guys can share in terms of what you're seeing – valuations, pipeline activity within certain categories?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Are you kidding?
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: No, I mean, just some incremental color, Jim. I'm not asking for too much.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It's a very active marketplace out there. We are incredibly actively engaged in that marketplace. But as you know, we're very picky, and that pickiness has paid off huge dividends in the past in terms of the accretive value that we drive through acquisitions. So, I assure you that I'm probably spending a major part of my time going out and looking for the right acquisitions right now, and again, nothing big has happened so far. We picked up some wonderful small acquisitions that have been nicely accretive to our women's health business, to our SPD business in that. So I can just guarantee you, we continue to be hot and heavy looking for the right deals out there, and when they happen, you'll be the first to know.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks for that, Jim. Matt, on the guidance for the year now, sort of tying in laundry and some of the discussion earlier on Persil, do you feel confident there's sort of enough cushion in the guidance? There would certainly seem to be given the commodity favorability and strong first half of the year should pricing get worse in the laundry category. We've often seen this when it's new product introductions, and particularly given that Persil seems to be aimed at Tide, if there could be the potential for some promotion here in the back half of the year. So the first question, do you feel comfortable you have enough cushion there should you guys need to respond? And second, sort of unrelated to the Persil dynamic, is XTRA, which hasn't gotten a lot of discussion on the call but has really struggled. And I know you guys are well aware of that, and there's been discussion in the past about stemming some of the losses there, but it just hasn't happened yet. So, maybe you can talk a little bit about that as well, sort of returning to growth in XTRA. Thanks
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Hey, with respect to the full year, Kevin, you know that there's always pluses and minuses that go into any of our forecasts. So when we scorecard the rest of the year, all of the things that you cited are on the page. So, the answer is yes, we obviously always forecast to leaving ourselves some flexibility to react to market conditions. As far as your observation about XTRA, your assertion is what, that XTRA is declining?
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. I mean, based on the scanner data that I'm seeing, it looks like it's declining significantly, at least in liquid, yeah.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: So our 13-week data would say that XTRA is flat. It is true that it had been on the down swing over a many quarter basis, but we've corrected that. We put a lot of promotion behind XTRA this year in order to deal with some of the competitor actions. So we expect that that's going to be stabilized, and it's going to return to growth.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just, Matt, quickly on Oxi. Are you guys pleased – it looks like you did promote. I know Bill Schmitz asked a question earlier about pricing and parity, but it looks like that was driven by promotion, which you guys have ramped here over the past 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks. Are you guys pleased with where you are with the entry there into liquid at this point based on repeat purchase rates?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Kevin, this is Jim. I would say, are we pleased with where we are? No. We want to be higher. We're very pleased with the progress. We had a big 20% gain in consumption in the second quarter. So, we've got good momentum behind the business right now, and we feel good, but we want to continue to grow the business. It's a great product. It's a great performance out there. We're very, very happy with the progress we've made in the beginning of this year. So, we're in the right direction. I would say within the customer where Persil is, OxiClean is performing very well versus the majority of the Persil SKUs. In fact, the majority of the Persil SKUs don't deserve to be expanded. And so we're not that fearful of Persil at this point in time.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Kevin, something else that might be helpful to you is that OxiClean's share is 1.2% in laundry. But where we have distribution, we're over a 2% share.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. No. That is...
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Remember, we're still trying to get trial and distribution in 2015.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Great. That is helpful. Thanks for the time, and congrats, Rick.
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the OxiClean line of questioning. Where does laundry share for that brand need to be? You mentioned kind of that 1.2% – 2% in the outlets you're in. But where does it need to be before you're comfortable about just the sustainability of shelf space? It's obviously done well, but you're spending still a lot on trade spending to secure that positioning. I'm just trying to figure out how long that needs to go on especially where you've got Persil and others entering new products in the category.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Well, you've got to appreciate, this is – we have not been in the upper end of laundry. That was our entry in 2014, so we priced this product 20% below Tide. So now, we're up against Tide and Gain, and more recently, Persil comes in. So, it's a crowded area and this crowd is not going to roll over and play dead. So, it does require a significant amount of promotion and advertising in order to get trial. So, as Jim said, yeah, we're okay where we are. As far as how you're going to hold shelf for long-term, significant – you got to be below 2% – or above 2% share. And we're at 1.2% today. We're at 2% where we're in distribution; we've got to get over 2% to hold share long-term and then grow from there.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Steve, keep in mind, this is a – laundry detergent is a $6 billion category so a 2% share is very meaningful revenue results. And we are again, as Matt said, where we have good distribution, we're over that already, and we're building distribution in other places (48:24). So, it's a challenge. We believe it's very doable. We have the plans in place, we have new product launches coming to support that and we will achieve that in my mind. And again, if we had created and launched the Steve Powers brand, and we were spending all this money, I would say it was a big mistake. But we spent all the money behind the OxiClean brand very smartly from a marketing standpoint and that's why we continue to do well on the original OxiClean additive brand is doing very well in the marketplace, benefiting from all the advertising we're spending on the laundry detergent version of it. So, and also the bleach version, we didn't even mention today, the launch into bleach last year, the Oxi brand has done extremely well. So, very incremental to the business. So, again, this is why we believe in mega brands because when you spend behind a mega brand, expand it to a new category, you get a lot of benefit on the prior parts of the brand that are out there, from the halo of the advertising bag. So we're very much going to continue strong support behind OXI laundry detergent, and we believe that will benefit the whole OxiClean megabrand.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: All right. I'll look for the Steve Powers brand extension next year. Just on the guidance for the second half where you guided to a deceleration, and I'm talking about from the top line perspective. I'm not surprised by the slowdown, just acknowledging the tougher comps. But it feels a little bit more stark than you had previously anticipated. Is that the vitamin issue? Is it changing assumptions in specialty? Is there something else in the margin creating that incremental caution, or is it just conservatism?
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's Rick. So let's talk about it from the total company perspective first. So in Q2, on a stacked bar basis, a year ago, we were at 3%, and we're at 5.1%, so that's an 8%. If you do the same thing for Q3, it's around a 7%. And if you peel that back and you take the specialty product business out and international timing out, and you just look at the domestic business, the stacked bar for Q2 is around 5.5%, and for Q3, it's a 6%. So we think it's actually a pretty decent quarter when you look at it like that.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. First on vitamins, have you brought in outside help to help you work through some of our your production difficulties, and if not, is there a need to?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: That is quite an open-ended broad question because you're assuming that there – what the issues are. Our issues are simply that in our Vancouver plant, we had some equipment that went down, and that was just one of those things. So we had to repair the equipment in our existing plant. In our new plant, the startup was expected to be completed in March. We have – this is very sophisticated equipment, it has to all work in a synchronized fashion. And once you get it rolling, it rolls. And it's producing now the way we want it to produce, but it's taken us three or four months to get there.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would say, Olivia, too, we've had some customers come in to see our new facility in York, and they've been blown away by the sophistication of it and its potential. So, again, we did the right thing, building a real state-of-the-art, spaceship-type plant that will produce – increase our capacity by 75%, and it was just a little more difficult than we estimated. We're very aggressive, and we had a very aggressive timeline, and it was a little more difficult than we estimated to get this state-of-the-art facility going. But we're very impressed by its potential. Our customers who have been in there to look at it are blown away by its potential, and it's just, we've had this short-term hiccup and we'll get it behind us, but it's being fixed.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks. So it sounds like September quarter, you'll still have some impact, but by December quarter, you should – you think that you'll probably be sort of on the path to where you had hoped to be earlier this year?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's right.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: That's good. Yeah.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Perfect. Thanks. And then just following up on international, I mean, I know it's small for you, but the price mix contribution was only 2% versus the FX hit of 15%. So is there an opportunity or plans for incremental pricing and it just hasn't hit yet, or is there something else that impedes the ability to price up to where the FX hits are?
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Yeah. It's a decent question, Olivia. You got to remember, most of the categories we play in, in these countries are – we're a relatively small player, so we don't have the pricing power to really take FX impacts. So the 2% is largely in Brazil where there is currency impacts, and I would say the whole country price is up. But in general, no, we don't – we can price up all the way to cover currency.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Is there more incremental opportunity than the plus-2%, or if competition is not moving then obviously it's tough for you to push that?
Rick Dierker - Vice President-Corporate Finance: Right. I would say plus 2% is a reasonable number.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly on personal care, you did discuss Trojan but can you talk about trends in your other personal care categories as well, just the competitive challenges in those categories? Thanks so much.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. The other personal care categories, they have actually performed better over time than some of the household categories. And household again was dragged down by the laundry category, which was a big part of it. And we've had good results. Our shares have been strong in those categories. There have been some pricing competition in things like pregnancy kits, which has caused a bit of a war out there. But, no, we're – we got a lot of new products in those categories, and we're very happy with those products from that. And if I had one wish in life, I'd wish I get the Trojan category growing. The condom category has been relatively flat now for quite some time, but we're working on some major new product launches in that category and some great new marketing programs to help to get that going forward. Because that's the case with a 76.4% (54:16) share, it's really incumbent upon us to drive the category more than share growth, so – but we have some plans in place over the next two years, which I find very promising to rejuvenate that category and get it growing again.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Understood. Thanks so much, and congrats, Rick.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Good. One more question, guys, and then we're going to – we have to get off to back to building this business.
Operator: Okay. Our last question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Your line is open.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Two quick ones, do you have a timeframe that you can share for how you're thinking about growing into the new capacity, the new vitamin capacity? I know you said it increases your capacity 75%, so just a reasonable guide post there would be helpful. And then on – in terms of margins in the business, you're committed to maintain a marketing ratio, I think, in the kind of range we're running at today, 12.5%. You've seen quite a bit of SG&A leverage in 2013 and 2014, not so much in 2015. But is it reasonable to think, going forward, as we look out to 2016 and beyond, that more of the margin expansion, to the degree that there is, is going to be driven by gross margin, just given kind of the dynamics this year? Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Jon, on the vitamin side, we wouldn't have built a plant with 75% volume upside if we didn't think we would use it. We're just not in a position right now for a reason to expand upon that and how we plan to get there and when. So, a good question, but sort of like laundry compaction, we're not going to answer it. And then on the gross margin side, I'll turn that over to Matt and Rick.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. With respect to SG&A, you're right. We've had a lot of SG&A leverage over the past few years. But part of our long-term model is we try to grow our operating margins 50 basis points annually. And the way you're going to get that is – the lion's share of it is from gross margin. That would be 25 basis points to 35 basis points, and the rest is going to come from SG&A. And as we saw this quarter, if you hold SG&A dollars flat, you're going to get leverage. You'll have 15 basis points of leverage in the quarter. So, yeah. You have to be vigilant about how you manage SG&A. We're not going to get the 50 basis points or 60 basis points a year from that line item. Acquisitions, obviously, can help because our acquisition model is essentially we buy marketing contribution, which is gross profit minus marketing. So that gives you instant leverage on your SG&A. And that has been part of our story historically. So, yeah, there's lots of leverage to go in there. Hopefully that's helpful to you.
Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, it is. Thanks, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you all – good, thank you. I'd like to thank you all for tuning in today. Another great quarter from Church & Dwight, a great first half of the year despite the problems we had on vitamins and a lot of great things coming in the future. So, thank you all for your good questions. And if you have any more questions, give Rick, or Matt, or me a call and we'll do our best to answer them. So, thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have great results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our first quarter business results, which you've read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year and then we'll open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the first quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued weak U.S. consumer demand and foreign currency, the Church & Dwight team built upon our momentum exiting 2014 and continued to leverage our innovation-driven strategy to deliver strong business results in the first quarter of 2015. As I have stated in our previous earnings release and at the CAGNY Conference in February, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over one-third of our sales in 2014 came from new products launched since 2007. In 2014, we launched a record number of innovative new products across every one of our major categories and three new categories. In 2015, we launched fewer new products, but our new products covered every major category. Some of these new products like our new premium priced cat litter called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL, have become a huge hit with our consumers as reflected in both our brand share results and its impact on category growth. In 2014, our cat litter consumption increased by 23.5% and our share grew by 2.9 points to a record share of 22.9%. This enabled our brand to move from the number three brand in the category to a strong and growing number two brand. Just as important, our new product has been a major contributor to driving an 8% increase in the cat litter category in 2014, the strongest annual growth in any of our categories and excellent growth for any CPG category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote for driving improved value-creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. In the first quarter of 2015, we built upon this success by launching a new light-weight version of the CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. This new product is also off to a great start. Our total ARM & HAMMER cat litter consumption in the first quarter was up 15.5% and our share grew 1.4 points to a new record share of 23.8%. And this growth helped drive the cat litter category up 8.6% in the first quarter over the first quarter of last year. Our goal is to continue launch innovative new products to drive share gains and category growth like this in all of our categories in which we compete. Overall, the first quarter results were excellent on the share front, with share growth on three of our four megabrands. I'll now turn the call over to Matt, to give you specific details on our first quarter results.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. So, first quarter EPS was $0.80 per share; that compares with $0.73 last year in the first quarter, so we're up 9.6%. The $0.80 was better than our $0.78 outlook, and netted in our $0.80 is $0.03 or a 4% drag from FX year-over-year. So we're off to a very good start in 2015. Reported revenues were up 3.9% to $812 million. Organic sales for the quarter was 3.6% and this exceeded our Q1 outlook of 3% organic sales. The organic sales beat was largely driven by the success of our international business and the continued strength of our animal nutrition business. Of the 3.6% organic growth, approximately 3.2% is volume-driven with 40 bps of positive product mix and price. Now, we're going to go through the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increase was 1.6%, and that was in line with our expectations, and was driven by ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter, VITAFUSION adult vitamins, and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent. Now these increases were partially offset by lower sales of XTRA laundry detergent, TROJAN condoms, and OXI laundry detergent. Remember last year, we had the launch of OXI laundry detergent in the first quarter. So the 1.6% met our expectations; we were lapping the new product pipeline from last year. It was our largest year ever of innovation in Q1. The volume growth contributed approximately 1.2% to organic sales, plus 40 bps effect of positive price net of negative mix in the quarter. We expect full year organic sales to be approximately 2% to 3% for our Consumer Domestic business, and notably in the second quarter, we expect 3% to 4% organic growth from domestic. Now we're going to talk about International. International organic growth was up 9.5%, volume contributed 10.5% with product mix and pricing being a drag of 1%. We had strong growth in France, the UK, Mexico and our export business, largely driven by two brands, Batiste and Sterimar, which is our nasal hygiene brand. We expect the full year to be approximately 3% to 4% organic for the Consumer International business. And now turning to Specialty Products, organic sales for the Specialty Products division increased 10.8%. The animal nutrition business drove a 7.7% volume increase and we also had favorable mix and pricing of 3.1%. With respect to the Animal Nutrition business, currently, the U.S. dairy industry is still healthy, driven by demand for our products – driving demand for our products, I should say. We expect organic sales for this division to come back down to earth for the balance of the year. We have very difficult comps ahead of us for this division. Remember last year in Q2, Q3 and Q4, we grew 20% year-over-year in each of those three quarters. So, for the full year, we expect the Specialty Products business to be up 3% to 4% organically. So now, total company, full year, we expect organic sales to be approximately 3%. And you saw that in the release. Gross margin is next. Our reported first quarter gross margin was 43.8%. That's 40 bps better than last year. If we look at it year-over-year, 20 bps came from volume and price and the other 20 bps is the net of higher margin acquired businesses net of FX drag. The company's outperformance versus the outlook, remember that our outlook was flat gross margins for the quarter, our outperformance was due to higher-than-expected volumes, earlier-than-expected benefit from commodities, and some of the start-up costs related to our new vitamin plant have moved to the second quarter. For the full year, remember in February we called 25 basis points of gross margin expansion. Now, we have 40 basis points of a beat in Q1, so that's going to live through for the year and that's what's driving the change in our gross margin, the 25 to 35 basis points on a full-year basis. Now I'm going to talk about marketing. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $88.8 million or 10.9% of revenues, that's 30 basis points lower than the prior year's spend rate, but it's $1 million higher on a dollar spend. Marketing is a function of the timing of our product launches, as you know, and our full-year expectation is still approximately 12.5% of sales. Next is SG&A. So SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.7% in Q1; that's a 20-basis-points increase from the prior-year first quarter. That's primarily driven by incremental amortization of intangibles and higher R&D costs. On a full-year basis, we still expect 15 basis points improvement year-over-year in SG&A as a percentage of sales. Other income is next. So other income was $9.1 million negative, that's $2.2 million worse than the prior year. And that's primarily driven by transaction FX. And next is operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.2%, which is 50 bps higher than the prior year first quarter. With respect to income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 35.1%. And that's higher than our full-year expectation of 34.5%. The tax rates in the quarters can be lumpy, but we continue to expect the full-year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%. Cash is next. So we generated $144 million of net cash from operations in the first three months of the year and we invested approximately $22 million in CapEx year-to-date. That's a big number for a first quarter, but remember we were wrapping up construction of our new vitamin plant in York, Pennsylvania. We expect to spend approximately $70 million on a full-year basis on CapEx in 2015. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $570 million and free cash flow to exceed $500 million. We bought back $250 million of shares in Q1. That's right on target with what we said in February. And remaining on our share repurchase authorization is approximately $332 million. Just a word on the new vitamin plant. As you read in the release, we are starting up our new vitamin plant. We have been living hand-to-mouth for a number months as demand has exceeded our capacity. And the new plant is expected to expand our capacity by 75%. And the future prospects for this business are very bright as more adults switch to gummy vitamins. I'm going to wrap it up now. So, the first quarter highlights include 3.6% organic sales growth; 9.6% EPS growth, which, by the way, equates to 13.6% currency neutral EPS growth. Thinking ahead to Q2, we expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.70 compared to $0.65 last year. So, that's 8% up year-over-year in Q2. And that excludes a pension termination charge of about $0.05 that we expect to occur in the second quarter, and we've been talking about that one for a while. We expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 3% to 4% and flat gross margin. With respect to flat gross margin, that reflects our greater vitamin plant start-up cost shifting to Q2, as I mentioned earlier, and the negative drag of FX, and also further investment in OxiClean in the second quarter. And the commodity relief is going to be as expected for Q2. Now the full-year. So, last year we had all of our EPS growth in the second half of the year. So, 2014 was a back-end loaded year from an earnings perspective. This year we have higher organic and EPS growth in the first half due to easier comps, and our most difficult revenue and EPS comps are ahead of us in the third or fourth quarter. With respect to the full year, just to bomb down the income statement, 3% organic sales, a gross margin expansion of 25 to 35 bps, marketing at 12% of sales, and 15 basis points of leverage on SG&A. So that math gets us to operating margin expansion of 50 to 60 bps in 2015. And to the extent we over perform on gross margin expansion, and we intend to invest incrementally in marketing behind our megabrands. One thing I missed was other income and expense. It's going to be relatively flat year-over-year, about $17 million of net expense. And the full year range remains at 7% to 9%, that's despite a 3% drag from currency. We used to think it was going to be 2.5%, so it's got a little bit worse. Back to you now, Jim.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Matt. Before I open the floor to questions, I'd like to provide a few highlights on our first quarter business results in our key categories and business units. As you know, we continue to sharpen our focus in our four megabrands, ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean, Trojan, and our vitamin business. These four brands represent over 60% of our company's sales and profits, and we have achieved the most growth over the past five years due to delivering a bigger bang for every dollar of marketing investment. In 2015, we plan to spend over 80% of our media investment on these four megabrands. This investment continues to pay off as reflected in my earlier statement that we achieved share growth on three of these four megabrands in the first quarter. The ARM & HAMMER megabrand had an excellent quarter, with total consumption up 4.3% driven by its laundry detergent and cat litter products. I previously mentioned cat litter results in which consumption grew 15.5% in the first quarter and our share increased 1.4 percentage points to a record 23.8% share behind the new CLUMP & SEAL product line. ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent also had a solid quarter growth. While the total laundry detergent category was down 1.3% versus a year ago, the rate of decline has steadily improved for past four quarters. Hopefully, this category will soon begin to generate positive growth again driven by innovations and the return to a more historical promotional environment. In the first quarter, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a 10.0% share, up 0.5 percentage points versus year ago, the 21st consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth. As a total company, Church & Dwight achieved a 14.1% dollar share of total detergents in the first quarter, up 0.6 percentage points versus year ago. We have grown share year-on-year in the laundry detergent category in 19 of the past 20 quarters. And we're one of only two manufacturers in the category to post dollars sales growth and share growth in the first quarter. We do not often talk about other products and all the categories covered by the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, but ARM & HAMMER carpet deodorizers achieved its highest ever quarterly share of 50.1%, up 4.2 percentage points versus year ago. And ARM & HAMMER baking soda achieved its highest ever quarterly net sales in the first quarter. All in all, a great quarter for the ARM & HAMMER megabrand, which is our largest mega brand with over $1 billion in annual sales. Next, the OxiClean megabrand had a strong overall quarter. The brand's total dollar consumption was up over 20% driven by the new OxiClean liquid laundry detergent line, which was launched in the first quarter of 2014. OxiClean's share of the $1 billion stain product category, its original category, declined by two-tenths to 44.9%. But this is still greater than the combined share of the next three brands, which are sold by three companies many times larger than Church & Dwight. Our third megabrand, the Trojan brand, had a mixed quarter. The Trojan condom business achieved its highest quarterly share in the past five years. It's 76.6%, up 0.2 percentage points versus a year ago. In the total condom category, the top 14 SKUs all belong to the Trojan brand and 26 of the top 30 SKUs are also Trojan SKUs. Other forms of the Trojan megabrand also had a strong quarter. The Trojan Vibrations line of products achieved an 8.3% increase in dollar consumption and recorded its second highest dollar sales quarter ever. Our Vibrations line now has the top three SKUs and six of the top 10 SKUs in the category. The Trojan lubricant line, first launched in February of 2013, has now achieved an 8.5% share of the category, making it the number three selling brand in the lubricants category. This new product line continues to show share potential as revealed by the 11.3% dollar share that it achieved during the week of Valentine's Day, an all-time high for the brand. Last but not the least is our newest megabrand, the gummy vitamin business, which we bought in October 2012. This business consists of two brands, Li'l Critters for kid's gummy vitamins and Vitafusion for adult gummy vitamins. Our gummy vitamins business had a solid first quarter despite supply constraints, which we believe will be shortly resolved by the startup of the new production line in our York manufacturing facility, which we expect will increase our production capacity by about 75%. First, there was great news concerning the growth of the total vitamin, mineral and supplement category. As you may recall, this category has been one of the fastest and most consistently growing categories in all of consumer packaged goods for many years. Then, in the fourth quarter of 2013, a study was released which question the positive health benefits of taking vitamins. This negative news led to several quarters of flat to declining consumption of vitamins. However, the category started to rebound in the second quarter of 2014. And now, it's starting to demonstrate more robust growth as reflected in the 4.3% growth achieved in the first quarter of 2015. Second, our branded vitamin business grew a stellar consumption by 7% in the first quarter, driven by a 13% consumption growth of our adult Vitafusion brand. Vitafusion continues to be the number one adult gummy vitamin with more than double the sales of the number two gummy brand. Third, our Li'l Critters kid vitamin business is struggling right now as dollar consumption fell about 10% in the first quarter, driven by some aggressive competitive pricing and new products. We expect to reverse these trends by the end of 2015, driven by some new products that will be launching. Overall, a very solid quarter for our four megabrands, with three of the four achieving share growth and, in some cases, new record shares driven by our product innovations. I'll finish off our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year, just to reiterate what Matt just told you. As stated in the press release, as a result of our strong first quarter results, we are raising our 2015 guidance for organic sales growth from 2% to 3% to 3%. And we're raising our expectations for gross margin improvement from 25 basis points to 25 to 35 basis points, and we're maintaining our earnings growth target of 7% to 9% despite an increased drag from currency from 2.5% to 3%. We feel confident in delivering these targets, which are in the top quartile of EPS projections in our industry, consistent with our historical performance. It's just too early in the year to get even more bullish, given the ongoing uncertainty about the worldwide economy, currency rates and competitive activity. The achievement of our targets will be driven by our resilient portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products across every one of our major categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs. I also want to assure you that we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions and have significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective about the types of businesses we acquire and we're very aggressive on how we integrate them into our existing business. That ends our presentation. And I will open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Kevin.
Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Jim and Matt, congratulations to both of you. Jim, on your retirement, and Matt, on being promoted to CEO.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kevin.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Thanks, Kevin.
Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC: If I can start with – and Jim, I appreciate it's a personal decision, but I think investors will be curious with respect to timing. Because I think it's a little bit earlier since people are expecting, including me. So to the extent you can comment on that. And then I think, what it may or may not suggest with respect to transformative M&A? And then I have a follow-up.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Kevin. What I would tell you is it's the right time for the company and for me. The company is in great shape, and with great plans in place. And we know there's new product pipeline for the next two to three years. The acquisition pipeline looks better than it has for some time. And we have a strong productivity programs in place. And I strongly believe that Church & Dwight can continue to deliver industry-leading TSR results. And I have great skin in the game on this decision, if you want to know. Over 75% of my networth is in Church & Dwight stock, and I intend to keep it that way, because I do have great faith in Matt and this company's future. Hey, I've been CEO for over 11 years here. But I'm going to be 62 years old by the end of this year and there's other things I want to do in life and do them before I get too old to do them. So, in my mind, it's time to turn the reins over to someone younger and have a smooth transition over the next eight months, and Matt's perfect choice, guys. He is a great leader, he understands the secret sauce to our success, and he's proven that his skills and business acumen are way bigger than being just a great CFO. And trust me, I'm staying on as Chairman to be here for whatever assistance I can to Matt. So that was basically the thinking. It was my decision to do this and I'm very happy with it. I'm so proud of this company and the results we've turned in, and I have great faith, as proven by my financial networth tied into this company, in the future and I'm sure Matt will protect that or he will be getting phone calls from me. Okay.
Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for that. Just one more follow-up with respect to the role now. So when the announcement was put out back in November, Jim, your intent was to spend more time on strategy and M&A. Matt, is that going to be your intent also to be devoting more time to that come January of next year or should we expect the further announcement of a COO? And then also if you can comment when we will know who is the CFO replacing Matt will be? Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. With respect to acquisitions, Kevin, acquisitions have always been an activity that the entire management team has engaged in. When I was named COO, that was an opportunity for Jim to pull back a little bit and let me take the reins of the company. But the acquisition effort is always a team effort, CEO, CFO, and the entire leadership team. So that is going to be unchanged going forward. As far as the CFO replacement, no decision has been made with respect to who's going to replace me at this time.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And we do not expect to replace – have a new COO. We'll eliminate that job.
Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Congratulations, obviously.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Bill.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: My first question is how much did the Venezuelan pricing impact sales in the quarter? I'm just kidding. Can we talk about just the laundry category broadly? So like are you seeing any reinvestment for some of the Europeans or the currency help? We saw the Persil launch, I'm curious like where those facings came from. And then detergents, did the ARM & HAMMER brand get some incremental distribution, because the gains have been great? And then, lastly, on the unit-dose thing, it doesn't seem like it's a flash in the pan anymore. I mean, it continues to grow double digits. I know it slowed a little bit, but it's the only piece of the entire category that's growing. And I have a little follow-up, if you don't mind.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Hey, Bill. The laundry category, obviously, our biggest category, had good trends in the first quarter. It's still, like I said in my notes, it's slightly still negative versus year ago, but it's been four steady quarters now of improvement, and it's on the verge of going positive, so that's a good sign. The promotion and pricing environment also tended to get better in the first quarter. The pricing was up a little bit in the overall category, which is good, and the volume done on coupon was also down, which is good; so that was a good result. We've just seen the April Nielsen results that just came in and the category, again, continues to trend in a good direction on that. We had great share results in the first quarter. We just saw April. We're off to a great start in April, so that looks good. Unit-dose also, I think we promised folks we'd put a bigger effort behind this thing. I just saw April results and I think our consumption in April was up something like 28% on unit-dose; that was great. And those programs are kicking in now going forward, and we intend to get back to our fair share of that business. I can't comment on the Persil thing yet. I think it's too new to know what happened there, and what distribution came from. That's still trying to be figured out. But overall, feeling much better; continued improvement in the category. We continue to do very well in the category. We're fixing issues we had on things like unit-dose. So, right now, I'm kind of going from a yellow to green lights in the laundry category and I hope it continues that way.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just on the vitamin side, are you guys in allocation now? So is there like a scenario where that business sort of snaps back just because you can't fulfill all of people's orders?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I wouldn't use the word allocation but we are – we cannot supply all the orders right now. We're doing our best job of being fair to all customers, but that problem should be resolved shortly.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And congrats again, guys. I appreciate it.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your question, please.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Bill.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Hey, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First on the commodity front, I mean, I understand you saw a nice benefit on gross margin this quarter, but it seems like, or from what I can tell, resin prices have come down even further inter-quarter. So, it would seem like some of the bigger benefits are still on the horizon. So, how should I look at the gross margin rate of conservative? And just what we know now or do you feel like that's a pretty good number at this point?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: We think it's a pretty good number, Bill. So what that would mean is if you do the math, if you're up 40 bps in the first quarter and call flat for the second quarter, that means in the second half, you're going to have to be up 50 bps, right, in Q3 and Q4. So, the commodity help came a little bit sooner than we expected. And you're right about resin, there's a lot of help of there. Going the other way are things like diesel. We have some diesel hedges that actually have us higher than spot. So we don't always get that right, but that's – I remember saying in February down at the New York Exchange that those were some hedges that we were sad about. And transportation is also a bit of a ding for us as well and may be worse than expected. And that's with respect to lane rates and availability of drivers and things like that. So on balance, 25 bps to 30 bps is about right for us right now.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then switching back to detergent, maybe you can give a little color on what's going on with XTRA. I mean, I wouldn't think that sees a whole lot of pressure from the P&G brand. So, I mean, what's going on there? And then also on OXI, kind of in year two, are you net gaining more distribution for liquid laundry detergent or are you at least holding the share you got from last year?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Bill, on your specific question, XTRA was kind of hurt by all the competitive activity last year and also hurt by unit dose a bit. So, we have put plans in place to fix that. Again, I just saw the April shares come in and XTRA had a good, solid month there, and we have good programs going forward. So I feel like we've got plans in place to put XTRA back in the growth mode. On OXI, again, we launched last year, it was a tough environment with all the unit-dose activity and with the launch of Tide Simply. Brand got a good foothold. We have plans in place to continue to grow that. I think consumption on that was up double digits in the month of April also. So, we feel good momentum now going on both the XTRA and OXI and we've always had great, strong growth on ARM & HAMMER, the biggest brand of all. So, I feel very good about the laundry business right now. I feel it's heading in the right direction and I hope it continues that way.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the changes.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your question, please.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First, I had a follow-up on unit dose. The product now that – and as I've seen it, is really kind of like a powder in a pouch. Are you doing any work to have a liquid formulation?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I don't project, Lauren, on based on what we're doing in the future. When and if we do something, we'll let the world know, but not until we launch anything.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I just didn't know if I missed anything, frankly. Okay. And then on the International business, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit, I think I always have a hard time, it feels to me that when you've got better-than-expected growth, I can never really put my finger on why. So if you could talk a little bit like how those businesses are managed. Is there a Mexico country manager, are there calculated growth plans by quarter, or is it really kind of managed almost as a virtual export business? Thanks.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. That's a good question. So, the way to think about International is as follows. So we have an EVP that's in charge of the International division, and that EVP has a number of general managers that report to him. Canada is our biggest subsidiary and so we have a follow-on legal entity in Canada, in the UK, in France, in Mexico, Brazil, Australia and China, so that's around the league. So we have a general manager in every one of those countries and a legal entity. And on top of that, we have an export business. And our export business is not entirely in U.S. dollars. In fact, more of it is not in U.S. dollars. It's in pounds and also in euros, so that's good news for us because we're not as impacted by the strong dollar with respect to our exports. But you should think of it as you have all those countries and you have full management teams in each of those countries selling brands, and those brands, by and large, are more local brands than our megabrands. We do have some megabrands that travel, so for example, ARM & HAMMER detergent in Canada and Mexico, so North America. But that obviously wouldn't travel over water very efficiently. So, outside the U.S. it's more personal care businesses and more local brands. So then when you say, you have an eye-popping number in the first quarter, you say, wow, 10%, where did that come from? Part of that is because we had easy comps here. Last year, the International business rolled a doughnut in the first quarter. So that's number one. Secondly, it can be somewhat lumpy. So, if you look at the last two quarters, Q3 was up 1.7%, Q4 was up 7.4%, and now we post a 10%. But I wouldn't get used to that because we're expecting on a full-year basis, 3% to 4%. So, I would say easy comps. We have a new product performance, and export shipments sometimes can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. And it's the law of small numbers, right. So 10%, but you're on a much smaller business. So it doesn't take as many sales dollars in order to drive a big percentage growth.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Lauren, I want to add too that we have some, Matt said local brands, some of them have travelled in various markets. Two brands in particular, Batiste, which is a dry shampoo business we bought a few years ago, is growing like fire right now. And our Sterimar business, which is a nasal hygiene business, is doing exceptionally well and it's in almost all those countries and those are both high-margin personal care type brands. So, our team internationally is incented the same way as the U.S. team. The measures of revenue, gross margin, cash flow, and their earnings contribution and that. We had great teams, great general managers, great leaders of the organization. They're just kicking butt right now. And I'm a little more optimistic than what Matt may say, but I think, because again, we've got greater innovations going in those marketplaces and great teams going in place there. And our export business, we're exporting some of these hot products into the countries where we don't have direct general managers and they're also doing very well.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: And one last thing on International that I think is also useful to know. The way we manage Europe is on not a legal entity basis. We have France and the UK legal entities, but we have a European team. And Europe actually is now our largest subsidiary and has eked out the number one position over Canada.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wow, okay. And how big is the export piece of the International business? 20%?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: It's not – I'd say it's about $100 million, round numbers.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks. This is really helpful. And Jim, I can't help but ask. Are you moving to Cincinnati? I feel like I owed you one. You made fun of all of us for so many years. I had to give you one.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We were buying them and moving them here.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. New Jersey. It's a good state. Thank you so much.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Jason.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for the question. Congratulations to both of you.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Thanks.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: One thing that surprised me with the transition, Jim, was your assumption of the role as non-executive versus executive chairman. Can you talk a little bit about what this means to your level of involvement beyond this year?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Jason, honestly, I'm a big believer, as my predecessor was, there's only one CEO of a company, and you got to let them run the company. You don't want two cooks in the kitchen there. So, I got a great guy in Matt. We've been attached at the hip for eight years. He knows this company in and out. He knows he's been basically running the company for a while now as COO, and we don't need two people running it. That's how companies get screwed up, in my mind, when we got two people at the rutter. We got a great guy taking over at the end of this year. I'm fully here until the end of the year. Trust me, I'm fully in place, and then Matt will take over fully on January 1 and I'll be, as non-executive chairman, I'll be in charge of the board and I'll be there if he needs me. As my predecessor said, if you need me for something special, I'll be glad to step back in on that, but there's only one guy going to drive this company. That's the way it's been, that's the way it works best, and that's going to be Matt Farrell.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. I agree. Capable hands with Matt. You mentioned Persil, you don't really want to talk too much about it, it's too early and you gave a lot of statistics in sort of looking backwards what we see in the data so far. I know you guys are close to the retail trade, any early indications that P&G maybe retaliating to stop Persil in its tracks?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. Not that we see. I mean, I'll call Cincinnati, but no.
Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, good. Hopefully, we don't see it. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Your question, please.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Joe.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I also would like to extend my congratulations. It's going to be sad not to see you Jim at CAGNY next year, but hopefully you could make an appearance for us, so – anyway.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah, Joe, he didn't say he wasn't going to CAGNY.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's a very good point, that's a very good point. So, in terms of the overall marketplace as you see it today, is there a shift going on within your categories between advertising and promo? Because if your marketing spending is staying the same on a relative basis, and laundry is getting better I think from a promotional perspective, what are your other categories doing in terms of that shift from above-the-line to below-the-line or vice versa?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, good question, Joe. Every category is different, but first I would say, there's continued improvement in the category growth rates on the quarter. Not big, again. In past quarters we've had maybe four of our nine key categories growing. Now we're getting – it's getting better than that. So we're seeing slow but steady progress in the marketplace, which is a good sign. I'd have to go over every category for you, which is different. Again, general trends are good, overall. There's a few categories where there's still a little bit of pricing wars going on and things like that. But I'm encouraged. I hope it continues in this world that people are getting back to the game of innovations driving categories and not letting pricing and couponing driving category. I think we've all learned that's a road to nowhere. So, we're seeing good, slow – very slow but steady progress and a good direction here. I hope we get back to the days where you get 2% to 3% category growth. Maybe – hopefully, we'll get there, but we're not there yet. But I'm very encouraged by what I see out there in the marketplace, and I just hope it continues.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And then in terms of personal care, it seems like that business, or that segment, was flattish to down on an organic basis. You talked about a few things going on there. But vitamins was still up, I think, even though you're constrained a little bit. It sounded like Trojan was down a little bit. So if you could tell us what's going on there that's sort of keeping you guys from really growing that segment?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Again, vitamins, we have to be careful. When we say vitamin category, we're talking about the whole category, hard pills and gummies. And the whole category was up like 4%. The actual gummy segment is up like 9% to 10%. So, that's really encouraging news. That's why we bought into this business because the gummies was the fastest-growing piece of the business. So gummy is doing very well. Again, we had a decent quarter. It would've been better if we could've supplied everything that we had orders for. But things are very good there. As I said, the category rebounded from the bad PR news that happened a year ago. In the good old days, this category was growing high single digits. We're now back to about between 4% to 5% growth, and I hope it continues growing that way. And the gummy piece is two times that as far as growth where we have the key piece there. The other one you mentioned, the condoms. Condoms has always been kind of a strange category. It's not that big a category, it's about a $350 million category. We have, obviously, a very strong share there with about a 75 or 76 share. But it can also be flat. And it's just the case of there's a lot of alternatives. The birth control out there, there aren't a lot of alternative to disease control, which upsets us, but we have great new products out there. Like I told you, we have a strong position as far as the leading SKUs in the category. And we're going to keep bringing new innovations in that pipeline, new advertising. I don't want to tip my hand. We've got some really cool programs happening in the back of this year to help it. In the meantime, we're building our vibrations business and our lubricant business, which are very high margin businesses there and we're leveraging the Trojan name into those categories. So, I feel good. I feel good. Especially, the new product pipeline looks awesome and I would love to tell you what we have coming, but it's against my policy to tip my hand to competitors on what's going on there. I feel very positive about some of the new innovations we have coming in the next year or two.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck to both of you.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS. Please go ahead.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. Good morning, congrats from me as well. Hey, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the gummy capacity and how you plan to use that when it comes online? I understand obviously the near-term capacity constraints. But thinking longer term, will this be used more to increase production and distribution of existing categories or should we now expect a more material acceleration in your moving into new adjacencies?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Hey, Steve. We wouldn't comment on where we're going to go for the growth. I mean, the category is growing double-digit, particularly the adult vitamin category. We expect that to continue to grow in the future. So, there's enough opportunity today where we are to fill up that plant. And you're not going to fill it up immediately. That's a tremendous amount of capacity growth. Remember, assume the business is around $350 million, like 75% capacity is over $200 million of sales capacity. So, what we're really saying is that we believe in this category. We've made a big investment there and we think it's going to be a part of our growth for a long time in the future.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then maybe just a quick update on cat litter, which continues to be great. Just any that you're thinking there given presumed new innovation from competitors. I'm guessing the answer is yes, but are you comfortable with your plans ahead of that, securing your shelf space across the whole portfolio, that kind of thing. Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Steve. I maybe talk too much about this, it's because I love talking about this business, because it's the absolute case. Hey look, cat litter is one of the simplest products to make in terms of ingredients, and yet we found ways for product innovations to make a better, and better, and better cat litter. This new CLUMP & SEAL cat litter is by far the best cat litter in the marketplace. The consumers are reacting to it. We've had a real challenge to keep up the demand. And then on top of that, we launched the lightweight behind it, which solves a major issue in the category. If you're a cat owner, lugging home those boxes is like an Arnold Schwarzenegger act sometimes. But we came out with a lightweight that's half the weight of the previous product, and the consumers just loved that. So I just love – we have some products which are very complicated to make and things like this. This is a relatively simple product to make with simple ingredients with some interesting technology, and yet we've been able to drive category growth in the high single digits, and that's the thing I wave in front of my people's faces. If we can do this on cat litter, why can't we do this on everything. And innovation is the name of the game, your premium price it, you put it out there. The consumers love it. Even in a tough economy where you hear about value all the time, and we certainly love that with our value laundry business and that, people love trying innovative new products and they'll pay a premium for them, especially when they deliver premium performance. And the cat litter one has been the best example for us of this, and we're just kicking butt in this category. And we have more new innovations coming, and it is exciting to us. And of course, you know, cat is an overall good category. Pets are the new kids; two-thirds of American households have a pet, only one-third have a kid. So it's a great category for growth and we're taking advantage of that and bringing innovation to the marketplace. So, I'm sorry, I have verbal diarrhea sometimes when I talk about this category because it's just a great example of what I want to do in every one of our categories. And our cat litter team is doing it, and our other teams are trying to do it, too. So, it's the name of a game and all competitors should pay attention to this and do it. It's a win-win for all of us.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Cool. I see pet gummies in your future. Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And, guys, I won't get sentimental on you, especially you, Jim. Just a couple of things, I guess, one, usually you're pretty good at talking about consumer health and consumer behavior patterns. I'm just wondering since CAGNY, have you seen anything over the last couple of months, lower gas prices and maybe some wage increases. Have you seen anything kind of on, I would say, the low end of your portfolio at this point that gets you a little bit more optimistic as the year progresses?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. It's interesting, Jason, we've all read the report, the results – studies done by Visa and everything else which said initially about 75% of the savings from the gas were going into either paying down debt or being put in the bank account of consumers. My sense is it's starting to ease up a little bit and there's starting to spend a little bit more money out in the marketplace, particularly when they see innovative new products. I think you're also seeing a little easing by manufacturers in – of their pricing aggressiveness out there, as they feel they don't – they should focus more in innovation and not focus so much more on pricing. And again, the bottom-line result of that is the categories continue to slowly – very slowly, but slowly show improvement versus year ago in the trend. So, I don't want to say I'm overly optimistic at this point, but again, I'm still probably in a yellow light but I feel there's more green creeping in, every month go by. And again, I just saw the April results and they were very encouraging, particularly for our business, very strong and the categories were also continuing to show improvement. So, I got to hope this continues and it will only encourage all the manufacturers to continue to focus more on innovation and less on price wars, and lots of consumers love that because they want to try innovative new products and that. So cautious still, but slightly getting greener every day.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. No, that's good. And then the other question I have is I was wondering if you could kind of – like, if you look at the consumer domestic piece of this for this quarter in terms of breaking down between – you talked about the megabrands, but maybe talk – and then, the non – I guess, non-megapower brands and then the non-power brands, so the tail brands that you still have in there. I know with the non-power brands – I'm getting tongue-tied here, they still kind of weigh a little bit down on the growth overall, what you're doing in terms of trying to stabilize the growth there. Those are businesses that don't really get much A&P. But I'm just wondering, could you talk maybe a little bit about the profitability or what those brands are doing to contribute to overall accelerating growth in the portfolio?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'll be glad to. And again, you're making a good point, just because we so focus on the megabrands does not mean we've really taken focus off the other brands we have. And we have four or five of what we call power brands. Just quickly, Nair had a great year last year and is having a great year this year; off to a very good start. And the key season's coming up now for consumption, so we've shifted a bunch of new products, we've gotten great retail distribution for them, but now we'll see with the weather and the consumer what happens in Q2 when consumption happens. The pregnancy kit businesses, that's been one where we've had a little bit of pricing wars going on in the category. But we have some big new product innovation coming in that business and looking forward to getting that category back to innovation. Toothbrush category has been a little – again been a lot of competition there, a lot of pricing there. So that's been a little bit of a tough category for us, whereas the toothpaste business has been very – we've had some good signs there, some good decent growth in that category. So that's kind of the recap. As far as the – what do you want to call them, the tail brands or whatever that everybody has in their business, that's probably about I'd say 10% of our revenue base. I'll be honest with you, I've taken a personal project. I have a special team of a bunch of marketing folks who work on that, and I've personally gotten involved with that, meet with them once a month to help to not only slow any decline in those brands but try to drive growth in those brands, and we continue to find every way to do that kind of thing. So it's kind of a fun project for me personally to get involved with those businesses, and we're planning some really cool stuff. We've had some great successes there. ARM & HAMMER baking soda, which is one of those smaller brands, is delivering some good growth there. As I mentioned, our carpet deodorizer business is actually now over a 50% share of the category, kicking butt of some big competitors out there doing well. So we love to find ways to get out there. Kaboom is a brand that's had a little bit of softness on it, but we've got some new innovations coming. So, trust me, we don't give up on our brands and go sell them like some of our competitors. We believe they're still decent brands, but we're smartly spending most of our money behind the big megabrands, but we're also finding innovations and smartly spending behind some of these smaller brands, too. Overall, it's good.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And congrats, Dr. Farrell.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey, thanks. Guys, I guess you probably noticed it, but so many of your competitors are talking about taking marketing down. There's a big push on – pushing spending out of non-working media into working media. You were the only ones where the actual media spending as a percentage of sales isn't really doing much. So can you talk about – I guess what are you doing on the non-working to working side and what do you think your share of voice has done in your categories over the last year or so?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Chris. I almost want to thank you for bringing this up. I think it's a big charade by our competitors about what they're doing. I think they're cutting their marketing spending or telling you they're shifting it over and saving money because they can get the same bang for the buck. They're not. They're either trying to cover, in my mind, their foreign exchange hit or they're trying to cover sales hits there. So, I am not a big believer in shifting to digital and getting same bang for less money. We are increasing our commitment to digital. But we're not using that as an excuse to cut our marketing spending. We're keeping our marketing spending strong, as we told you about 12.5% of sales. So that's on that issue. No, I would just tell you we're keeping our market support strong. I actually hope to take advantage of the fact that our competitors are cutting back on their marketing spending; and our share of the voice, which you're dead right, is a thing to watch. Our share of voice is strong to up in most of our categories because we are continuing to spend same amount of money while our competitors are cutting. So, I'm a big believer. And again, you can't launch innovation and just put it on the shelf and expect people to look at it, and understand it. You got to have the marketing support behind it. And we are going to maintain steady marketing spending at about 12.5% of revenue. The formula has worked. It's delivered the great steady organic growth we've had. And we're going to continue doing that. And I'm not going to use this – trying to watch my language here. I'm not going to use this game of telling you I can cut my spending. By the way, our non-working to working level has always been low. So we don't have a game we need to cut back and punish our agencies and take money away from them. We always have very good agencies. We've had a long-term relationship with the three key agencies we have here and we've always paid them a fair thing, but not some of the outrageous wages some of our competitors do so. And they've been great partners for us and know our brands as well as we do and have been a key part of our growth. But it's not a case there where we've had bloated non-working costs at all. But we have very happy partners, been with them for a long time.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So you don't see any material decline in non-working media going forward, I guess?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. Not for us.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, okay. And I guess on a separate note, I think you guys mentioned incremental OxiClean investment as one of the gross margin drivers. Can you talk about that a little bit, give a little more detail?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: No, simply that we're in the second year of our quest to drive OxiClean to be in our second megabrand. So we have a lot of spend ahead of us and that's just one of the year-over-year drags in the second quarter.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. So, doesn't sound like it's a very material piece of the -
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Chris, let me go back for a second. Let me give you a little perspective on the non-working to working. It's the same perspective as overhead. Everybody is all talking about the 3G effect out there and a lot of people are cutting overhead. Well, we were there a long time ago. We invented the whole keeping overhead low. We have the – I've been bragging about this constantly, we have the highest revenue per employee in the entire industry, and yet we keep getting better finding ways to do it. But it's not a case like we're waking up like some other guys and trying to cut overhead because they're bloated. Same thing on non-working; we've always had a very, very leading-edge ratio of non-working to working, and so we're not sitting here bloated and looking for opportunity to cut it. So, if you look at that as bad news because I don't have cost savings, well, too bad. I mean, we're already aggressive there. Now, we keep looking for ways to save as we have on the overhead side, especially with the acquisitions. We bring them in and leverage our top line and kind of hold the overhead line so our percentage goes down. So, I just feel we've always had great attention in those areas and it's helped to deliver our great results.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks for the perspective.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Your question, please?
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you. Wanted to touch back on laundry, because it sounds like you feel better about laundry overall, trade spend's normalizing, fixes to unit dose, et cetera, but it didn't look like at least from a track channel perspective that your sales did trail off a little bit towards the end of the quarter and going into April as well. So perhaps can you talk a little bit about that? And then also I know it's early on the Persil launch, but how, if at all, have you adjusted your own plans as a result of that launch?
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Olivia. Every quarter has its – you know, you can't have strong results for all three months of a quarter. And we generally, we had a very strong middle of the quarter and somewhat strong at the end, so you can't look at a four-week period and just say we were weak exiting Q1. I told you, we already saw the first four weeks of Q2, just came in, they were very strong. So, overall, things are tracking. We've had what I'd say 19 to 20 quarters we've grown ARM & HAMMER liquid. In 21 to 22 quarters we've got overall laundry detergent growth in the past four years. The only guys to have growth every year for the past four or five years. So, we're still trending there very well. Persil, I can't really comment on Persil. It's way too early. We have not adjusted our spending to deal with them. Don't forget they are premium priced, which is just a small part of our business. The big bulk of our business is value priced, so I would expect any pain from that launch to be more focused at the premium end of the market.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks. And then, Matt, you guys addressed M&A strategy, no change there in terms of your thought process, but what about other parts of the business and just the portfolio overall?
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: That's a very open-ended question. Could you be more specific?
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just thinking about how you – I know it's still six-plus months before you take the helm, but just thinking about your thought process as you address the portfolio, whether you think anything is going to change when you move into the top spot.
Matthew Thomas Farrell - Executive VP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer: Yeah. Well, look, one thing about Church & Dwight is we are very transparent. And we have a known strategy, we have a very explicit business model, and that we go out of our way to make sure – not only on the sell side, but all of our investors understand the direction of the company. And the direction of the company is set. So we're a company that focuses on innovation. So we're good in innovation, we're terrific at execution and cost control, and we've proven that we're first class when it comes to identifying and integrating acquisitions. So none of that's going to change. And we feel good about our – we have four megabrands that generate a significant amount of our revenues and profits. The last thing we're going to do is take our eye off the ball there and, as Jim said, we have other power brands that also generate significant amount of cash earnings, which are also important to us. So, we try to grow the whole portfolio and we feel good about our family of brands that we have right now.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats to both of you and best of luck.
James R. Craigie - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, operator, I've got an annual shareholders meeting coming up here in a little bit, so I'm going to cut it off here. I want to thank everybody for tuning in today. I'll just leave you with a thought. We've had a great start to the year. We got a lot of stuff ahead of us here, and I think we have great programs over the back half of the year, and again, I'm very excited. I thank you all for your comments today about the transition here. I assure you it's going to be extremely smooth. I assure you it's going to be business as usual with Church & Dwight. Matt understands the mojo or the secret sauce whatever you want to call it about this place, and there's no plan to change any of that and he's got a great team of 4,000 people behind him who understand that. So the Church & Dwight for the past 11 years is going to be the Church & Dwight for the next 11 years. So we're going to continue deliver industry leading total shareholder return results. That's our goal; we're going to do it. So thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Number 1, we had excellent 2014 results we delivered 8% real EPS growth despite headwinds and we achieved share gains on all four of our mega brands. Two, we exited the year with very strong momentum, we had 5% organic growth in Q4 and we’ve had the highest growth margin of the year. Three, as we always do we’re playing to win in 2015 with a real aggressive but achievable plan. We have very strong new product pipelines I believe as strong as last year and we also have a great start with retailer acceptance and we have continued focus on growing our four mega brands. Four, unlike many of our competitors we have minimal exposure to international headwinds less than 10% of our revenue is outside of North America and 8% EPS growth target, we have includes the 2.5% foreign exchange headwind. Many of our competitors are facing double digits headwinds and we’ll talk about that later today.  Number five, we’re returning cash flow to shareholders raising our dividend to 8% that’s high about 40% payout which is our goal and we have a new $500 million to our share authorization to continue to allow us to buy back shares. And number six, don’t take that share buyback as any sign that we’re backing up an acquisition, we’re still aggressively pursuing acquisitions. We make two small bolt-on acquisitions in late 2014 and we have $2 billion of additional purchasing power ready to exercise at any time.  So there is the six points, those are a nano second [attention span] , you’re done, otherwise those of you want to pay attention to hear some really great news coming forward, stay tuned here we go. All right, total shareholder return, you know I’ve told you for my 10 plus years during to this company, we are all about total shareholder return that’s we care about most. Our investors love it or non-investors keep missing the boat on this company let me show you why. My favorite shot of the day this is how Church & Dwight consistently and significantly outperformed S&P 500 whether it’d be one year 2014, the last three years 2012 to 2014, the last five years or the last 10 years you’ll see our results there. And I think a it’s kind of interesting, its 21% for one year, 22% for three years, 23% for five years, and 18% for 10 years and when compare that to what the S&P 500 did over that timeframe and you’ll see a significant difference across the Board. This is important within our industry you’ll see how we stack up against our major competitors, we are number one across every one of those timeframe in the total shareholders trend we delivered, so we’re very proud of that we aren’t just a one year wonder, not a three year wonder, not a five year wonder and we are a ten year total time spend here of outstanding results being everybody, every major company in our industry. Great numbers, great results but that’s all about history, what about tomorrow. That’s why we’re here to talk about the future. And I am going to tell you ten reasons why we believe we can continue to deliver superior total shareholder return results. Number one, this is a little different, in the past number one used to be we have a recession resistant portfolio. I’ve changed the tune to mean we have a resilient portfolio. Let me tell you what that means. That means we have a product and geographic portfolio that continue to excel despite major headwinds on three basis. One, we’re still recession resistant. Two, we have minimal explore to weakening foreign economies, and three we have minimal impact from foreign exchange rate. Let me tell put those numbers for you. First of all our portfolio is unique. Nobody else in our industry has a portfolio like this. We have 60% premium brands, 40% value brands. Last year that was more of 55% to 45%. We’ve brought some couple of business we’ve brought were premium oriented so now we’re little bit more premium, but a 60/40 split. Why is it important? Don’t forget our competitors when they talk that they have value brands. What they really mean is they have premium price brands with more benefits than other premium priced brands not for us. Our value brands offer a true economic value. You can see from this chart the different categories of these value brands they’re significantly lower priced than the premium brand. Why is that important? This economy is still a recessionary type economy as consumers are still very value oriented. You see the shift the consumers from the premium mid-tier down at value and extreme value tiers. It’s still out there still strong.  Look at the laundry category, our biggest category we are in, a $6 billion category more U.S. households now buy a value detergents than a premium mid-priced detergents, so people love value, it’s big. The value tier has now passed the mid-priced tier being the number two tier in laundry detergents, that’s huge and it’s growing. People are still looking for great data and they learned hard lessons during the recession. They still want a great bang for their buck.  You can see Church & Dwight has been a winner on this. We’ve gained three share points in the value detergents 2009 and we’re now bigger the two, three and four players combined in the value tier. You can see a little guide in P&G has popped up now in the value of tier. We’ll talk about that more in a minute. Church & Dwight is the only laundry detergent manufacturer reporting share growth since 2009 you can see our pro forma 3.5 share points. We are now second to Procter & Gamble and bigger than Sun. Secondly, about our resilient portfolio is we have minimal exposure to weakening foreign economies. We’ve listen to earnings report from our big competitors their screening these numbers, don’t forget 84% of our revenues and almost 90% of profits comes in United States huge advantage right now. Foreign exchange headwinds are huge, it’s 2.5% for us but if you referred in the past week or two a 10% headwind for Colgate, 12% for Proctor & Gamble I heard little over maybe they reported even bigger number. so these kind of phases [ph] I would challenge one thing today a lot of you have seen the reports are acting as if this is a one year wonder. I don’t get that. Why do you think the U.S. dollar is apparently going weaken in 2015 or the foreign currency is going strengthen, but I guess with second question a lot of our competitors to deal with this are raising prices in the foreign economies, don’t you think that’s going to have an impact on their consumption. The consumers in those marketplace don’t have more money and their competitors are raising their prices to offset some of these headwinds, hello if you don’t think it’s going to hurt consumption I think you ought to think about it again. Not a big problem for us. Secondly, driver of our total share origin strategy, we have a successful megabrand share growth formula. Now that share growth formula is not anything new from competition. A little bit of new products, we get to that increased marketing spending, increased distribution that leads to share growth, that formula hold a stone but we do it exceptionally well. First of all you can see since we created a new product team back in 2007. We have got a great track record on driving revenue growth for new products. Today almost 40% of our revenues in 2014 came from new products launched since 2007.  You will be a little bit surprised for this chart, we spend behind our products Church & Dwight despite be only a $3 billion, $3.5 billion company, small compared to other guys on this chart, we spend more on advertising than these major CPG companies. So we spend big behind our product news. You take that to get a new products increased marketing spending and you get increased distribution. The sales team did an outstanding job taking their product news and spending out to retailers, retailers appreciated, they give us more distribution, winning self is the first war you want to win out there in gaining share and we have done a great job across all of our major brands, sometimes on doubling pace since 2009 as we have laundry detergent and cat litter. You put that all together and it leads the share growth.  You’re keeping this chart going back to 2008, the green bars in the chart show share gains, the red charts for share loses, yellow is neutral. We have gained share and over 75% of the times over the last seven years. Some of our competitors talk about gaining or holding share, no we don’t count hold share as a win, that’s just neutral we count gaining share, we have an outstanding track record, I don’t think anybody in the industry can rack up to this chart with 75% of the time growing share. I would give the number to that don’t forget our aggregate categories last year grew 0.2% and yet we gain share and our organic growth was in the 3%, 3.5% range. That means we had to gain share to get there. So we are doing that. You have to gain share and win and we are doing that, we have a great new products, our increased marketing spending and our great distribution results.  So our past success was driven by nine power brands you can see in the chart. These power brands had 80% of revenues in profit. You can see that very important the market leaders in the categories they exist in. Retailers love them, we have great fight of the how many of the top selling SKUs start keeping use for the category are your brand, you could see from this chart in some cases all 10, in common detergent we have a top 10 selling comps category you can see all the way down there. We have very important players in our categories. But in 2014 we said that again what the great strategy on behind the 89 power brands we got evolved it. We want to evolve with the more focus behind our four biggest brands that we call megabrands, the Trojan, OxiClean, the Vitamin brands and Arm & Hammer. Why, because those businesses do 60% of our sales and profits. Those businesses have been the fastest growing businesses in our portfolio. Same formula, same formula on share growth there were new products, marketing spending, increased distribution lead share growth, but in this case the megabrands have an advantage. There is four reasons why you want to put behind them. One, you get bigger bank and I would point out them as a bigger bank in marketing investment, two they have greater licensing potential, three you have a bigger bank if you research and development investment and four helps to keep organizational costs down. What do I mean behind that? Look when you spend a dollar on the advertising behind a megabrand, and you do it smartly is grew strongly ahead of marketing here and gain view when you spend a dollar you will focus on one like and lot and Arm & Hammer and the laundry detergent we through the people here Arm & Hammer and it helps all forms of the brand. And in fact this brand that we don’t do advertise specifically that are growing because they have the umbrella effect of the this advertising. So spending money behind a megabrand helps. Now just the opposite I will take a one of our competitors Purex, which will be phased in laundry category, Purex is just a laundry detergent brand, and they spend a dollar on Purex it just helps only detergent doesn’t help anything else is nothing else but Purex alternative of the category. So being a megabrand spending behind is a big win.  We have entered in categories you can see we have taken our megabrands, taken the properties they have whether it’s utilizing, cleaning whatever and taken a five categories to grow those businesses. Those four megabrands are 60% revenues but we see it 75% of our marketing spending why didn’t I just told you that marketing is the bigger bang for the buck and better spend is there. Licensing which is lot categories properties our brands are utilizing in that apply to but we don’t to get into it. They are not our businesses, we don’t have strength but other companies have come to us other major companies have come to us and said hey if we put your brand the co-brand on our product it helps sell our product if we like it when we look at it we said it makes sense we do it. It’s great for us just a 100% gross margin, we don’t make it, we don’t sell it we have the right to look at and approve everything, make sure it’s just done right, they make and they sell we get a licensing fee, they half the course and expand the breadth or brand in the store.  Second thing R&D real hard in doing so, but we are working hard and just one category you can’t seeing something to learn about the utilizing, whitening, brightening whatever to all these categories. When you have a megabrand you can. You can take that property and might be laundry detergent apply other categories we have, if you get a better bank our R&D investment. Thee, the organizational cost we have just forms a typical categories separate brands just a separate brand in all them.  That’s a lot or organizational cost you will see that in my presentation we have the lowest organizational cost than any company in the industry, why? because we focus behind these megabrands to keep our organizational cost down. You add that all up a lower R&D investment the bigger bank of the marketing spending, the greater potential, low organizational cost, you get more profits. That’s what it all about folks. I am not a capitalist, I am not ashamed of saying lets all make a more profits.  Okay, let’s talk about our example, Arm & Hammer our biggest mega brand, over a $1 billion in sales. Here is a brand that’s in over 12 different categories today -- 12 different categories. It’s in more aisles in the grocery store than any other brand in America. You walked down those aisles, you see the orange, Arm & Hammer was all over the place. It’s both a premium and value brand. In the laundry category its value. In the cat litter category, baking soda, toothpaste as a premium brand so we expand all price segments with this brand. This might surprise you, Arm & Hammer is much smaller than some of the brands in that chart up there, but yes we're one of the top-25 advertised brands of America. I bet you wouldn’t think of that. So we've spend good buck behind Arm & Hammer. Our margin grew as the brand chopped in all forms of marketing whether it's TV, radio, online, in-store whatever. But the end result is who's the brand that goes back to 1846 over a 160 years old and in the last six years we've had a single-digit growth rate. And how many brands that are brand new have a high single-digit growth rate and here because the way we're going to market the way we I just told about how we export this business we're growing the 10% categories CAGR over the last six years. So and we don’t we stop no this tables little bit of innovation last year here's some of the great innovations we launched the Arm & Hammer Clean Scentsations laundry detergent, the truly radiant toothpaste, the Clump & Seal cat litter major winners. That was the best laundry detergent launched since Arm & Hammer OxiClean helped drive the 20th consecutive quarter of Arm & Hammer share growth, the cat litter was a monster, absolute monster. We drove over $0.20 increase in our sales strengthened our position number two player in the category don’t forget we were not in cat litter. We didn’t enter in the category that's old 1988 and now what 16 years later we're number two player with over 20 share grown over 20% with great innovations.  And the Truly Radian, a real tough category, oral care, we’re the number four player in the category against the big guys out there this was the best introduction we've had in a long time and we had twice the growth rate of the category because of this than our competitors did. So despite competitive attacks it was a tough year we were attacked on all fronts by major competitors we still grew shares on Arm & Hammer. OxiClean our next big mega brand when we really turned into a mega brand in 2014 it is one category laundry additive is number one brand bigger than next three brands combined second most advertised brand in Fabricare again Arm & Hammer in total above all categories bigger advertising but in Fabricare OxiClean actually spends more than Arm & Hammer, second-most only to the big guy in Cincinnati. Loved by consumers. This brand, I would tell you, from consumer surveys we take is more loved by consumer than any brand we have quite honestly I hear more I don’t know people when I tell them we own OxiClean oh my god the stories that come out of their mouth about OxiClean the great success they had in saving a jacket that was all done with stains and that people just love OxiClean they tell their friends about it. This brings a great success since we bought it in 2006 great high single-digit growth rate.  Again second most advertised brand is the Fabricare category so last year we said we have this tremendous property, this tremendous property stands for great stain removal, it’s in $1 billion dollar category but it can be bigger than that. We took a bold move, you know what let's take this in the three adjoining categories. Let's take it right into laundry detergent. People have been adding as a laundry detergent what mega laundry detergent with OxiClean that’s a great stain remover. Let's take it into the bleach category and go right up against Clorox and that. And let's take it in auto dish where again, stain removal in dishes is huge. So we went into three big categories making OxiClean a mega brand, great new laundry detergent over 80% of the business we got was incremental with 1.0 shares somebody said 21.0 don’t think that this is a $6 billion category that we got a one share of.  Secondly, we went into the bleach category, Lou Tursi and his team, we got distribution in the bleach category we never been before achieved a 2.2 share and over 65% of business that was incremental to our existing business. Three auto dish super tough category two big competitors beat their brains out all the time, we got great distribution and achieved the 2.0 share we exited the year as number three player having past Colgate-Palmolive brand number three in the category. So very happy we increased advertising by 66% behind this business it's a great holistic marketing campaign on all points behind all the new products as consumption as a total went up 26% in 2014 OxiClean we are very happy. Now I will tell you we're treating 2015 as a second trial year behind these forums we're not going to back it off going okay we're back into let's just say we're still full speed ahead on Oxo’s mega brand we're going to spend just as aggressively in 2015 on this brand than we spent in 2014.  Trojan our next mega brand I think is a business we bought in 2001 here's a very strong leading share of the common category in 2005 we make this into a mega brand, we launched in the vibrators 2013 went in lubricants so today we have a mega brand covering all those segments this brand has delivered nice penny share growth overtime out with a brand new condom, brand new vibrators, brand new lubricants and a record annual sales and record annual shares you might have seen New York Post today ran an article, the movie Fifty Shades of Grey breaks on February 14th if you go to a movie theater and watch that I know you all will you'll see some ads running before the movie think you'll have Trojan in them so stay tuned we're taking advantage of something that’s right up our ally and dealing with this brand.  Our fourth mega brand the vitamin business that we bought just a few years ago we bought this in October 2012 we saw the beauty in this a lot of our competitors looked at this and said while it's 3% of the total vitamin business they said who want the 3% player we looked at it and said yes 3% but it's the fastest growing segment of vitamins in the gummy vitamins huge opportunity already 56% of kids have got vitamins when we bought were gummy but only 3% of adult vitamins were gummy and then in adult category is a $7 billion category 21 times size the kids category so we said there's the opportunity keep the kids business keep it growing if you can but go after the adult category and the brand was at that time and still is number one gummy brand for kids and adult. We got a growth rate on that one again we did note in 2008 but since 2008 tremendous double-digit growth rate in this business we want that with new innovations we took multi vitamins and added some benefits to it for both the adult Vitafusion and the kid version L’il Critters. We increased advertising support 35% last year and had great results we built the number one share position for kids and adults and Vitafusion again the key focus we had on the adult side had double-digit sales growth all 12 months of 2014 and still tremendous ops by there. So as the year goes down we launched double suite of new products early year spend heavily behind it and then the markets for chicken in Q2 in that you can see we built momentum across the year, so really good, exiting the year with good organic growth. So our 2015 plan reflects continued focus behind those four megabrands, major new product launches in every one of them on the table suit today, Matt will give you the details in a few minutes. 75% of our ad spend we spent behind those four brands on our portfolio. As I said before we’re going to continue and the dish wash particularly in OxiClean to expand the rest of the megabrands in 2015, and again Matt is going to come here for few minutes to give you the detail behind the great new products. Number three, of the 10 reasons why I believe we continue to deliver great total share return, we firstly defend our brand. Great example is OxiClean, we launched this business since 2006, we launched the new products, increased the advertisement in 2009 was up to 40% of the category, it's a great new product we launched in that timeframe, we increased the marketing spending by 400% net timeframe. And then the big guys in Cincinnati said, you know what they had a little stain pen in this category but they said why don't we have a bigger piece of this billion category. So they launched a new their big name into laundry additives with powder forms and liquid forms. We just step back and say we're dead, no. you step back and say we're not going to give up to this category, with whole bunch of big new products, with co-branded on other parts on our portfolio to expand the breadth of the brand, its presence towards consumers, increase the advertising of the brand, again the number two most advertized brand in the category as in the day look what happened. Not only did we lose share, we gained share. And the big guy in Cincinnati and other competitors were pretty big names too you can see there, lost share. So we despite being the smallest guy in that chart in terms of size of business feed them all back. Now the story wasn't over, the big guys said, let's do it again. So they came out in 2014 as you all well know, was a laundry brand taking their big brand name down on to the value segment. So we sit back and say we're dead, the game is over, hell no. We came out with a great new form of Arm & Hammer called Clean Sensations, I told you out before, and we went upscale. They went downscale we went upscale. We brought up the OxiClean laundry detergent. We increased our advertising and trade spending by 5%, this is the category we already spent a lot of money and we increased it even above that. Look what happened here. Yes the big guys in Cincinnati gained some shares but we gained share too, and the other two guys lost. So as I said, we ferociously defend our business and we're not going to give up share, in fact we're going to gain share. International growth has been a nice little part of our portfolio too. International in 2001 was nothing in this company and then we brought Carter-Wallace and we bought some of the businesses. Today it's about 60% international includes Canada and Mexico, so when I say North America sometimes misleading. But international today is about 60% of our portfolio. Basically in the six countries it was 95% of the business out there. We had great results over time, some of these countries that really struggled with their economies, we had great results over time in these economies. The fact in 2014 overall we did 3.3% organic growth; we exited the year with 7.4% organic growth. So we have a great business Steve Cugine, Head of International couldn't be today he had flu. But he and his team are doing an outstanding job in very tough situations out there. What helps us do that? We've some local brands, call international power brands, some of these countries are number one in their category. We're also trying to expand our U.S. brands, our corporate power brands in these countries. We're also are building scale through acquisitions, we brought some cool businesses like Batiste which is a dry shampoo on the table here number one dry shampoo in the UK growing double-digits. And we're taking other international countries and we're leveraging our one company strength, whether be R&D, operations sales, whatever across all of the functions in these countries, so great shop. Gross margin number five, great story here we had 800 basis points of growth margin expansion from 2004 to 2014 that far exceeds any of our competitors on the chart there, most of them in fact haven't even grown they've gone backwards on gross margins. How do we do that? We have a good [degree] we rip off the book the cost optimization that covers everything from these formulation reducing packaging, Mark Conish our Head of Operations here today and his team is doing a great job there with Paul Siracusa the Head of R&D. Supply chain is structurally built and invested a simple amount of money in some new plans to be more efficient both in the Pennsylvania and California. Acquisition synergies we do like to buy higher margin businesses in house then knock out cost on top of that by bringing into our plans. And then last thing we like to launch, we launched new products higher margin new products. So that's all behind the grade when we set our new products, also gross margin. This is unique, I know of only one other company in our industry ever made that has gross margin as part of this company's bonus targets. Before that additional stuff, 25% of my employee's bonuses come from hidden or gross margin target. That's huge and that's tough. That's tough when you are dealing with commodities that are whiplashed back and forth. So it's a big driver, 100% of the people in my company look at gross margin every day, that does not happen with other companies, not part of your bonus target many times the marketing guys they don't give a damn about gross margin, its operations. My company is everybody's problem, everybody works on it. Again we've had programs driving it behind with the long way I am sorry. Now 2013 we had a great year with 80 basis point, 2014 as we told you at the start of the year we invested heavily to launch a record number of new products and we have some price wars going on, backwards in 2014. But the good news is we exit the year with a 45 gross margin exactly where we were in 2013. So we’re headed back to the right direction, we're calling gross margin improvement in 2015. Track record of acquisitions has been outstanding, I think you know we're known for this, we’re very specific in what we look for, we look for number one or two share brand, we look for higher growth, higher margin brands as we brought, we look for asset life, that means we don't like to buy businesses that have a large number of plans for big headed quarter things like that. We like business as we take them out and leverage our capital base from our plant from our headquarters and deliver sustainable competitive advantage. The track record has been great, much of our -- good part of our growth has been driven through acquisitions. You can see there the brands we had we brought eight of them since 2001 so big reason behind our good growth. We take those brands we don’t sit down on them we grow them. As I showed you with OXICLEAN before we take and we invest behind and we launched new products and we’ve grown share at every one of the businesses that we have purchased. We have had total bolt-on late year one Lil’ Drug Store had some feminine care businesses and we get into our women’s health businesses great acquisition about 50 million in sales. And VI-COR believe it they were not we bought business in the specialty product area that’s hit in right with our specialty products portfolio about $25 million in sales they are small accretive, their growth margins are accretive to our company growth margin, their sales growths accretive so we’ll get some nice accretion from these businesses in 2015 not much but nice little bolt-on. We love something much bigger I would tell you we’ve ever spent more time in a year that we did in 2014 shaping acquisitions, the right one just didn’t happen but yet but we’re still working hard on it and we have a lot of money. We have $2.5 billion with dry power to grow up make acquisition which is plenty big. Best in class free cash flow on conversion this is we’re made and Eric Drucker do a great job, we have outstanding numbers so we’ve increased cash flow almost 200% since 2004. We are the best in class. We do a ratio of 119% of net income in free cash flow. Look at the rest of the guys in that chart some get close but nobody beats us, outstanding numbers. And we’ve increased our dividend steadily almost 500% since 2009 and in our goals we have about 40% payout and we’re ready to get 8% this year. Overhead management this maybe something I kind of find interesting, I always had an attitude in house. We started as a small company we’re still the same, a lot of our competitors are big companies all here about restructuring charges, restructuring charges, restructuring charges kind of excuse me pissing away their shareholders’ money. You can see from this chart that’s I am very proud of we’ve more than doubled the revenue base in this company and yet we have hardly increased that all less than 10% number of employees going up led to our 300% increase in earnings per share, asset up in chart. I mean most companies who were doubled their size and revenue what can be close to doubling their size and employees it is bringing the people they hire of the companies they buy at amount. We don’t -- we largely buy the company get rid of most of the people and leverage our people and households on the businesses. As a result we have the highest revenue per employee of any major consumer packages company. We shouldn’t win that war. These guys are huge. Look at their revenue base versus us. They should blow us away with $22 billion brand, this will easily beat us on revenue per employee but they don’t because we keep such a tight employee base. And as led us to low S&G at percent of revenue of any major CPG company, this is again everybody wants to get to be like Church & Dwight we’re going to keep down, so they’re going ahead of keep chasing us, so lots of good stuff. And this is where we do walk to walk on type overhead controls. I wish I had a company car I want to go back in that. I wish I had a company car. I wish I had a company plane. I wish I had a golf club membership. We don’t do that. We never have done that. We don’t believe it’s our right and one of the companies that takes shareholders money and spend it on Wall Street from that so what we’re very tight on managing our overhead. Last but not least a very of the expert management team we have the people who our strategic business units, there is eight of them, are lifers, I tell them during that job for the rest of your life and they’ve averaged they’ve 24 years of experienced in the industry and those things like that people who know the business goal. I don’t move them. I don’t say the person running women’s health and go them put them in the laundry business and swap around. I think that’s stupid. Why just somebody who runs women’s health or the sexual health business, Trojan going to be come us as expert on laundry detergent you’re wrong move people we don’t move the top people around. As a result they know their businesses so that’s why the share results are still great that’s why 75% and we grow our share we know our business’ goal and also maybe losing minimize headcount. I grew up in another company where I was moved every two to three years later I had to have people big staff teach me to the business and teach me all about the business and two and there deliveries I’d move and they taught the next person about next business, sort of like Congress. We don’t do that. We have experts running our business they don’t need a huge staff and tell them what’s going on teach them about the business, so we were able to minimize headcount. We also therefore execute great. A lot of people know what works and what doesn’t work in driving share. They don’t come in new business new to the game and all of sudden something that’s tried 10 years ago and failed but they didn’t know. Our guys know that. They don’t make mistake. They execute superbly across all functions and then the acquisitions wise they don’t think it’s bored running business just along, so last point is it’s the secret. I’ve given new businesses we have acquired so I just gave the two new businesses we bought the Lil’ Drug Store brand to the woman who run our women’s sexual health business. She is now running that business now for 16 years. But now she gets these new acquisitions so I gave her that. I gave her Batista few years ago. They loved it more business as work down and should we run those businesses for the rest of her career and sure she likes, but it’s great to be an expert of those businesses. That’s a really crucial point. I hear some of competitors now changing their tune and star to keep their people longer on businesses while yes, make sense. I mean why take person just they get really a business they are moving to something that’s wholly different, it makes no sense to me, we don’t do that. Last but least kind of a summary of everybody up here, we are total shareholder return junkie. The number they speak for themselves across every line of the P&L how much we’ve grown across everyone industry leading numbers and there is my favorite chart. I think we’ll just stop here today and just admire this for a minute and seriously folks this why we’re right, are you here today where we one or they had award of year, best new Super Bowl ad? Are you here today to learn it. We are the best new product of the year. No, you are here today because of that chart. You here today to picture Church & Dwight stock recommended to your people to buy your companies and tell we’re worth more than $65 share and move us on out there it’s a thing. So there is the result industry leading numbers across the Board. There is my great team. That was shot a year ago will be ringing the bell at 4 o’clock today up there and I am really proud of it. So last but not least we take two, our bonuses somewhat unique, our bonuses are tight rate to drive total shareholder return. Our return on bonus is tied to those fourth factors 25% of its tight hit the net revenue growth number, 25% hit the growth margin expansion number, 25% the EPS number 25% free cash flow everybody in the company me and down I’ve on another Board another companies where the chairman has one set of targets the CEO has one set of targets and it changes. You can’t have that, we have a lined up, everything that company has the same targets, the same numbers, that makes us all work together in same way. Our equity, number two is the 100% stock option, very unique in this industry. Other companies have restricted stock, which is free money. You get it no matter what. In our company if that stock price doesn’t go up the day you get the stock option, it’s worthless. So we are very incentive on driving the stock price. It’s what our equity is based on. And we required to heavily invest in the company in the stock price. So we live and die Church & Dwight. 90% of my net worth is tied up in Church & Dwight stock, believe me I look at it every day, as I can look at right now. We will do okay.  So, last but not least here, here is Matt. 
Matt Farrell: Okay, hello everybody. I am going to talk about some numbers now. I will start with the fourth quarter. Just going to roll down the headlines. So you can see that we had a fabulous quarter from an organic standpoint, 5.2% highest for the year and I am going to show you the progression of the quarter is in the second and largely driven by volume, 4.7%. And then our gross contracted 20 basis points, we actually had expected expansion in the fourth quarter. Couple of things happened to us, we have a little bit more FX contraction or FX closing contraction in gross margin in the fourth quarter, and also had a mix issue because our friend in a specialty products business had another stellar quarter. There were lower gross margin than the other division.  Then our operating margin up 130 basis points. We also expected that to be higher but you probably all noticed that our marketing spend in the quarter was 13.8% and in our third quarter call we expected 12.2. So we elected to dial that up in the fourth quarter behind our brands. And as you can see, we head our expectations by $0.78. So it’s a little bit more color on the divisions. We see domestic 3.1%, international 74 and the specialty products business 20% I was a bit over surprised. So we came out a little over 5% for the quarter. Now you should look at that in context with what we are calling for next year. So you read in a release 2% to 3% and say while seriously had an awfully strong third quarter and fourth quarter, so that’s up with the 2% to 3%. So, the way to think about that is specialty product business had a stellar year. So everything went right, clean lights all the way. So that’s not going to happen again in 2015.  So we had an all-time record prices for milk in 2014, the $24, guess where it is today $17 today. So the dairy industry will still be profitable in 2015 but not as profitable as it was in 2014. So specialty products should expect in the come way down to earth and be more over 1% to 3% grower in 2015.  Going up to page international 7.4%, so before we get giddy about that, let’s remember what it was in the third quarter. So third quarter international was up 1.7%. So, that can be a very lumpy business, so that’s now represented above the run rate for international. And keep in mind that our two biggest subsidiaries are Europe and Canada and can expect that those areas are going to be growing significantly next year. Consumer domestic and a full basis was 2%, in 2014. So next year we are expecting 2% to 3% for domestic. So when you weight those altogether you come out with 2% to 3% for the business and that’s how the math works. Specialty products 1 to 3 and the other two businesses you can expect 2 percentage to 3 percentage.  Okay, here is the trend throughout the year, so you can see we are generally volume driven business, so we are average between 4% and 5% on a full year basis. So there is a trend that Jim talked about. So we finished the year super strong but again we call next year 2% to 3% for quarter 3% and the first quarter next year will be highest quarter for trade, couponed and slotting. And there is a gross margin progression as well. So highest for the year in Q4 expected to be a little bit higher but we are happy with the result of 45%.  And here is marketing. The 30.8% but that as the surprise I am sure to a lot of people how much money we spent and the difference on a full year basis if you spend 13.8 and we expected to spend 12.2 in the fourth quarter, that a 150 basis points more than we told everybody in November. So that’s 40 basis points hit to operating margin on full year basis, so it’s kind of simple math.  So now let’s go to full year 2014. So full year 2014 you see 3.5% organic sales, 4.4% volume, so it’s a volume driven year. Gross expected to be down 50 basis points, marketing up hand to 12.6% and SG&A by 2014 we expected to tighten our belts in order to fund the wards and trade worse in 2014. That 90 basis points down on a full year basis, for gross margin contrast with what we said a year-ago. We expect a gross margin to be flat in 2014 it was not. So that 90 basis points down reflects the price was in 2014.  Marketing you can see 12.6% that’s the good news and we actually 12.5 in 2013. I am going to show you the trend in a minute. And Jim said we upgraded overhead management, SG&A was down 90 basis points to 12.1. You might ask what are some of the contributors to that. Obviously, we have significant headcount control. We've also said in the past that we've invested in systems in order to make our people more efficient and one of the other unique things that we did in 2014 is we moved to a private exchange for medical and dental cost and unlike lots of other companies our average constant claim per employee actually declined 8% in 2014 and that is way out passing on cost per employee. So it was a win-win for the company and for the employees. Just rolling down the page you see free cash flow of $470 million that's a record for us and free cash flow conversion 113% and we've averaged about 118% free cash flow conversions for the past five years.  Now we'll talk about shares so you can see in full year 2014, 6 of 9 power brands grew share, 3 did not you can see the red one is up there first response, XTRA and Spinbrush, we think that's a great record and these cash conversion cycle so as you know this is a real good measure of the discipline within the company. And so we keep a lid on the cash conversion cycle you see the math up there the upper right what the calculation is [DSO plus DIO minus DPO] so again a very result and then here as we talked about earlier it's a $470 million of free cash flow. So one thing we should be aware of it because that's after CapEx and our dividends on an annual basis are about 170 million. So we started with 470 you say okay, I’m going to subtract the dividend with 170 million so you get 300 million you're going to add to that $50 million that we normally get from option exercises and you're going to see the $350 million available to us after CapEx after dividends on an annual basis so we are a cash generation machine.  And we've a very strong balance sheet so generating that kind of dough $350 million of free cash flow after CapEx and dividends that grows overtime and then on top of that we have an unlevered balance sheet that's why Jim is always telling you we have tremendous firepower and a great ability to acquire businesses but again we're very fussy about what we're going to acquire.  And we're declaring 8% dividend increase so that's commeasure with our EPS call for next year 8% EPS growth and 8% dividend increase. Pretty proud of that up 114 consecutive years of dividends and again our target payout ratio is 40% probably a little bit ahead of that, probably around 41% right now. So now we're going to talk about 2015 and before I get into the numbers as Jim said let’s talk a little bit about what our new products are if you want to study these charts carefully. So 2014 the year we just ended was our biggest year ever for new product launches and we had a great line up for 2015. So building on the success of Clump & Seal, Truly Radiant and also OxiClean so we're going to start with Clump & Seal. I guess that was our most successful product launch in the litter category ever so that category actually grew 8% in 2014, our share grew 290 basis points through 22.9% share right now and the Clump & Seal brand alone is 7.3% share. So we're moving into two areas now in 2015 with Clump & Seal; one is lightweight. We are the third entrant in there. You already have Clorox and Nestle and we're actually moving it to natural so we're definitely building on the strength of that Clump & Seal brand in 2015.  So now let's go to Truly Radiant where Jim talked about that as well so that was a very successful new launch for us in 2014 so now we're taking it into two new areas where we're not today on the left you see manual toothbrush in the middle you see rinse and on the far right we have a new variant of Truly Radiant toothbrush. So let's start on the left hand side of the page so manual toothbrush is a $700 million category and it's growing 6% annually. So our point of differentiation here is we have a rotating head on the manual brush, after lots of consumer test and the consumer scores are extremely high so we think we have a point of differentiation in entering that category. Rinse is next. Here is old category 1.4 billion also growing at 6%. We’re not in this category today. We're going in with a rinse that is alcohol free and I was going to say drug free and peroxide free. So you probably know that both of those are causes of sensitivity in tooth and gums so again we think we have a great point of differentiation entering that category and finally, Truly Radiant so Truly Radiant successfully launched in 2014 coming out with a different flavor in 2015 just to build upon our success in '14 so next we have White Revive. You talked about we entered the bleach category in 2013. So very successful and we have a 2.6% share right now in bleach. So this is the logical expansion for us so we're coming out with a liquid form of the additives you see that in the middle of slide and we're also coming out within White Revive laundry detergent so that'll be showed in the detergent category again building on 2014 success.  And now I'll talk about gummies so we had a very successful gummy acquisition that we acquired in 2012 so now we're pushing out into another brand so you recognize first response as one of our powerful power brands and this is our women's heath brand through leveraging that equity in 2015 by coming of the prenatal vitamin. We already have a Vitafusion Prenatal vitamin is going to be added to the business. And then we come to Odor blasters. This is another point of differentiation for us. So, a focus on odor removal here. And we an exclusive formulation which neutralizes odors. And that we're going to bring that into two forms of products, you see on the left the Arm & Hammer with OxiClean detergent well that's also going to be with odor blasters, and OxiClean our base OxiClean we're going to have a variant, it's also going to have odor blasters. So bringing some innovation in 2015. So fresheners and boosters, you wonder what is that? Well that is a $290 million category that we're not in today. And since then we had a very successful launch of creams and facials, in 2014 the fragrances identified as Clean Scentsations for Arm & Hammer detergent. So what we're doing is we're taking those fragrances and we're entering this category in 2015. So we have high hopes for that. So now let we get to some numbers. I'll take you through the 2% or 3% organic sales already due to the components of that. The gross margin is the next story, so 25 basis points up in 2015. So that breaks down as follows; we actually have a 75 basis point help in 2015 coming from three areas. One is commodities, next is Good-to-Great program which Jim mentioned earlier and the third is a normalized pricing environment. So that's where we would be up in 2015 but we have some things going the other way. So 50 basis points headwind from currency and also a new plant that's coming online in the first quarter. So just remind everybody that we spent $60 million on building a new vitamin plant in York, Pennsylvania that's going to come online at the end of the first quarter. And what we have to do with in 2015 are startup cost and we have to grow our way into all the additional fixed costs that we added to that business. So that capacity and the growth is on the comps but for now we have to deal with the drag from that. So we got 75 up from the three factors that I mentioned. And going the other, that's how you get to your 25 basis points of gross margin. Marketing at 12.5% I’m going to show you a chart on that in a second, so you see a lot of consistency there. We've often said that we spent 12% to 13% on marketing on an annual basis, so that's right in the middle. And as we expect to get some more leverage in 2015. So the way you get to 50 basis points of operating margin is 25 from gross margins, 10 from marketing which is 12.6 in 2004, and another 15 basis points from SG&A, so that's us 50. And then you cut the EPS, so EPS ex-pension charges 7% to 9%, just want to remind everybody that we're re-risking the company, we've been getting out of our defined benefit plans. So back in 2010 we got out of our U.S. pension, we terminated the plan, we've taken $0.11 charge back then, this is our Canadian plant. So we have a $0.05 charge, we're going to take probably in the second quarter you're going to see it and we're kind of looking through at. As you know we're kind of curious when it comes to reporting numbers, so first actually call something out separately, but we're consistent with how we go with the U.S. pension termination. Currency-neutral EPS, so you know we have 7% to 9% EPS growth but we also pointed out that we have 2.5% drag on the bottom line from currency. So on a currency neutral basis if you pick the midpoint of this 7 to 9, you have a 2.5% from currency you have 10.5%. And then share count, what you should use for full share calculation is 134 million, what that assumes is that we would spend about approximately half of the $500 million authorization that we announced today. So that is math, so let's get some context. So here's just a look back at our evergreen target of 3% or 4% for top line, this is how we've done over time and we can see recalling through the 3 in 2015, the marketing spend, you're not doing this for many CPG companies these days and as consistency is supporting the brand equity. So we've been around 2.5% now for the last couple of years and we expect to be there again in 2015. And here the EPS growth, you could see we had a consistent double-digit growth for many, many years up until 2014, obviously 2014 we ran for the price rates and were 7% to 9% for 2015. And here's the FX story, this was included as it seems to be a lot of discussion with respect to multipliers and ratios and comparing what's the top line versus the bottom line. So you can see 2014 we kind of laid it out for you there 50 basis points to the top line and 1.8% to the bottom line. We see very different story for '15 that EPS stayed at 2.5%, you would expect to be a lot higher, one of the things that is gone on our favor is we actually hedged the currencies early for 2015 otherwise that number would be far higher than 2.5%. And capital we raised, we generate so much cash flow we don't have a big investment spend respect to CapEx and you can see 2015 is very much like 2014 about $70 million, and for prioritize uses of free cash flow, so remember one destination in our company where free cash flow is going to be acquisitions. So we’re very deliberated about the order that you see up there I won’t read it to you but you see with respect to number four, we announced today we’re on 80% of dividend increase and a $500 million share buyback half of which we expect to use in 2015 and now we’re going to do some Q&A.
Q - Unidentified Analyst: Thank you guys, I don’t know if we can ask from the broader leadership team or questions just for you guys.
Unidentified Company Representative: I am sorry. I leading my leadership team up here Bruce Fleming, Head of Marketing; Jacky Brova, the Head of Human Resource; Mark Conish, Head of Operations; Pat de Maynadier, my General Counsel; and Louis Tursi, my Head of Sales; and [Ric Trukcer] who is our number two guy in Finance. So we will try to see if we can feel this now we’ll talk into one our specialists here who’d been some key drivers behind the company.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. I'd actually like to hear from the specialists first, if that's possible. A question for you, Lou. You've lived through lots of environments out there. Right now a lot of us are looking at oil prices down, we're expecting resin prices to roll over. Now you told us you're banking on more of a normalized price environment as we go through 2015. So, Lou, in your experience, what do you see when input costs start to roll over? What are you expecting in terms of competitive intensity, trade spend, demands from retailers, et cetera? And, Matt, if we do see more pricing pressure out there in the market what offsets do you have throughout that P&L to absorb that? 
Louis Tursi: So it was your segment question?
Unidentified Analyst: Your pricing goes bad how do absorb it?
Louis Tursi: Okay with respect to your first question, I think one of the things I am sure everybody is tracking what’s happening with respect to how much you sold on deal in Q3 versus Q4 that was quite an improvement and if you look at so the four weeks end of January 17th I am sure everybody is going to look at that, that period looks a lot like Q4 rather than Q3 so that’s sort of early thinking with respect to.
Unidentified Company Representative: The Q4 laundry detergent category was down only 1.9% the best time of the year and yet the trends are looking a little better, but I wouldn’t say that the world is over. And Lou do you want add in?
Louis Tursi: Yes, there is nothing much more to add then what you just said, so it has subsided in the back half of last year specially the fourth quarter. And we’re going in not knowing exactly where it’s going end up for 2015 where our company does an unbelievable job and react to whatever they do.
Unidentified Company Representative: [Jason], to your second question, if things get hot again out there from trade spending as we did this year we have two levers to step on we would step on SG&A probably first and try to squeeze even harder and if we had to last resource we’ll step on the marketing volume. I think Mat that comments just towards the end of his time, a lot of our competitors are cutting marketing spending in 2015. They cut 2014 they’re talking about cuts in 2015, we’re not, but if pricing was a problem you can be wrong on price out there but hopefully pricing now is kind of stabilizing out in the marketplace and we’ll spend our advertising dollar and again if the trouble happens, we always have the S&G lever to pull, don’t talk my employee but we’ll put hard.
Unidentified Analyst: So Lou did you want to add anything to that discussion.
Louis Tursi: No.
Unidentified Analyst: Can you talk a little bit about the increase in the marketing between end of October, beginning of November when you gave us the guidance for the fourth quarter and what you actually spent, and where you saw -- it sounds like that was more advertising than promotion, but where did you see the benefit from that? Because it seems like in the fourth quarter the big upside surprise on the revenue line was on specialty, which you don't advertise. And it seems like the first quarter is only going to be 3% top-line growth. So, I'm wondering how confident you are or how happy you are with the payback from that incremental spending.
Matt Farrell: Yes, just to clear to be clear the fourth quarter the five versus the three calls actually it was broad based that not just specialty was actually all three divisions did better than we had expected. I mean that’s all you should think about, so it wasn’t a doughnut for you know what you’re saying if you take up the marketing spend, did you get anything back for that. So remember the international business is a component at the consumer business and the domestic business also was up as well and Jim was correct where we put most of spend to kind of mega brands.
Jim Craigie: We at the end of quarter at about tweaking about 12.2 which is lower than our annual average and as we saw the quarter progress and things are pretty looking good, it’s a big quarter for brands like TROJAN, TROJAN really bit at end of the fourth quarter and things like that, it’s a big quarter for laundry detergent so we have the opportunity to go back and spend that. We felt very good Bruce Fleming get his gang lifted the talk with the agencies. There was good quality advertising out there. So whatever we can and still deliver we promise, we went out there and spend the money and the organic results speak for themselves with a good quarter and we think it gave us momentum coming into 2015. We’ve done that in the prior years too so the payback ratio is always -- we can’t even calculate that for another couple of months to look back and done things like that, but we always feel we have good return on the money and again the organic at the first time, organic was good, the sales results were good, 20% EPS was good so whenever we get a chance to support our brands, we did have the honest and we had assigned and some competitors were pulling back. So it’s kind of competitive advantage for us to step up the gas and category we’ve faced competitors out there. So we took those abilities to do it again only because we knew we felt we can make sure we can deliver the goal we felt for fourth quarter EPS once we felt that was pretty solid, we then lose put some money in the marketplace when we had a good chance for quality advertising out there, it was advertising, it wasn’t trade. It was advertising dollars.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Over here Ms. [Schmitz]
Unidentified Analyst: A couple questions, Jim. I think for the first time in probably five years you said you think the US economy is going to accelerate in the back half of the year. But you only guided to 2% to 3% growth in the consumer business. So, how do you square those two?
Jim Craigie: We’ll also get -- I do think [$2 gas] is going to be a good thing in the economy. It’s got to help out. But, again, if you look at our aggregate categories across the year, the 13 or so category look in the aggregate categories grew on the year 0.2%. Again we still delivered 3.5% growth. Fourth quarter little bit better was 0.6% growth. So even with that we still count 2% to 3% of category growth. I will wondering where is this money is going. Hey we all saw Apple’s results, iPhone sales roof. My personal belief the majority of the savings from lower GAAP prices, lower energy cost is going to go into more discretionary category, such as iPhone, such as digital game, such as restaurant sales and things like that. I don’t think people are going to rush out and buy more laundry detergent in two phase and Cat Litter and things like that.  Again we haven’t seen, okay, 0.6 was one of the best quarters we had in the fourth quarter but it’s not the old days for 2% to 3% category growth in that. So I am not going to step out right now and tell I see stronger category growth in 2015 which we haven’t seen yet. 
Unidentified Analyst : And then, Matt, can you just go through the gross margin guidance? Because this quarter you said you have this massive negative mix from specialty, and next year specialty is going to go to, like you said, maybe flat to 2% or whatever. So, aren't you going to benefit from that mix reversing back out? And then on the commodity side, do you have hedges that are hurting you this year or are they even or are they beneficial? 
Matt Farrell: The first thing with respect to specialty, year-over-year. So if we said it’s going to grow 1% to 3% so it’s going to have big negative mix, but it’s negative it’s not going to a big positive year-over-year. So it’s just a small so this year when you have business up 9% of yourself and it grows 20% it’s a big swinger that business growing up’14 to ‘15 to growing 1% and the others growing 2 to 3 it’s going to be a big over. Sorry Matt, and what was the second question?
Unidentified Analyst : The commodity stuff, just where your hedges are there because you talked about--. 
Unidentified Company Representative: So we have lots of, we have seven inputs that are most volatile that we have talked about in the past. So we have just going to run to employee again. There is surfactants resin, paper is probably be your big three. After that you probably have palm fatty acid distillate and then diesel oil and then followed by Latex. So we’ve probably got 6 or 7 right there. And I hate them all. As far as the hedging, diesel we have more hedged now than we were this time last year. Some of you who read 10-K so you are going to pick that up you are going to see we are 60% hedged and this up for ’15 last year around 30% so we are sad about that, we put less hedges on diesel the good news is on currency is as is said we got ahead of that. So we are not having as bigger heard as you would expect on the currency line. Some of the other ones that I discussed were not hedged at all, I won’t go into which ones, but on a fully loaded basis we are less hedged today than we were last year going to 2015 with the excision of diesel. 
Unidentified Analyst : Got you. And then, Jim, do you still think that VMS and OTC is a platform for you guys? Because I know it's been a few years now since Avid. And I know there's been a couple of little bolt-ons. But it's still a massively fragmented industry and it seems like there's so much stuff out there. So why is it taking so long to get a more sizeable deal done? 
Jim Craigie: Bill, I think it is a massive platform by gumifying of the OTC world especially for kids. It’s a typical because you have to unlike vitamin where you have vitamin levels in that you put in vitamin you could eat the whole jar and it won't kill you. When you are dealing with actives whether it's cough and cold or aspirin allergy medicines you have to have the exact amount active in the gummy and maintain the exact amount of active in that gummy for 18 months to 24 months, that’s the truth and that’s what we are trying to correct right. We believe we can but it takes time to get there. So we can’t just unlike launching other vitamin which is relatively easy getting into the OTC categories is much more difficult and it’s just taking time, but we do see as a big opportunity. 
Unidentified Analyst : I'm buying. Thanks. First, just to follow up on the input cost question, I'm going to assume the reason why the benefit is mostly in the second half of the year is because of the diesel hedge. So, it's that everything else starts to catch up in the second half?
Unidentified Company Representative: So it’s not just Steve, so I think all people would look at oil and so oil is down 50% therefore everything else must be down 50%, it’s not the case. So resin for example is down 10%. So it takes time for it to work their way through the supply chain and through the inventory. So I think heard lot of CPG companies saying expect the benefit more in the second half than the first half. So that’s kind of diesel story, that’s all the inputs.
Unidentified Analyst : And at this point how significant? When we think about gross margin through the year, is it down in the first half and then up significantly in the second? Is it that sort of progression?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well we said we are going to be flat to year-over-year in the first quarter. So the 43.4% last year first quarter. So, no help in the first quarter so obviously the next three quarters are going to have to be bigger than a 25% expansion. So yeah. 
Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And if you could talk a little bit about the children's Gummies. You mentioned in the release that that business is a little bit softer in the fourth quarter. So, just curious if there's any real color on why and if your competitors are finally waking up and realizing that this is a great product for them?
Unidentified Company Representative: I mean it’s very competitive, the children’s gummy section is very mature. So I think that the vitamins for kids took thirds of it is already in gummies, so is there is not lot of room there. So it’s super competitive. We are still the number one there. We big a gap as we had before so in measured channels, L’IL CRITTERS is 28% share and Flintstones also the 28% share which is there, but that excludes COSCO and that's were huge in COSCO, so with COSCO we're sort of number one in kids. But yes people have woken up two earliest competitors and we'd see a lot of the people are successful in gummies right in children's gummies coming with characters. They license characters. So that sells with kids where we don’t pay a license consequently we have a higher margin because we just have the L’il Critters. But we haven’t gone that path with the characters.
Unidentified Company Representative : But again we're more focused on adult for those 21 times of size of a kid category and $7 billion category with only 8% penetration of gummies right now. I just had my annual physical at John Hopkins a few months ago and I was talking to my doctor and he was asking about the business. I told him we send we sell vitamins so I sent him a box of gummy vitamins. And he just wrote to me back the other day his mother-in-law was in town that she tasted the vitamins she loved them so much she took on the bottle of gummy vitamins which is exactly what I've always said I dare anybody to try a gummy vitamin in the adult and if you don’t switch from your hard pills you're crazy, you're done. Pass the microphone back there. 
Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. A year ago this time we were talking a lot about really intense slotting fees in the first half with all of the new launches. Matt, in your gross margin bridge I didn't hear about any pull back in that year over year, so I'm wondering what's gone on in that line. And then just given the commentary around hedging, given where you are in FX and the timing delays in the commodities, holding everything else equal, does that imply you're going to probably have a 1 point incremental FX drag in 2016 that we should be thinking if we're thinking beyond 2015?
Matt Farrell: Yes I will take that one first for FX so you're right. So if the fact that dollar stays strong for the next three years to four years then right from '15 going to '16 we would have a hit a bigger hit with this type of currency, but that is a broader issue for any multinational company. So one of the things that tends to me that a lot of investors are not focusing on is when you look at EPS people say well, here is the EPS I'm going to add back local currency some are going to feel good saying well absent local currency here is my number, but as you pointed out if the dollar stay strong in three year to four year period the cash earnings of multinationals is permanently like depressed and we don’t have that issue because as Jim said 90% of our profits are kind of the U.S. so yes we'll have some of bit of a hurry in '16 versus '15 but the good news is that our cash earnings will not be permanently depressed by strong dollar. Your first question with respect to slowing, so yes you're right we had a lot of slowing in the first half of this year and I didn’t call that out separately but I did say was that gross margin would be up 75 basis points in 2015 for three reasons and it was commodities good to create in a normalized environment for pricing so it's all kind of motion in there and within that you have trade, coupons and slotting. So there are a lot of variables coupons is a multiple of slotting. We did call that out last year because we were going after so much new distribution for OxiClean but the math is far more complicated than that so we're 75 basis points up from those three factors and then we had FX and the new plant 50 basis points going other way.
Unidentified Analyst : Okay, two questions. One we heard a lot about the four mega brands obviously getting the bulk of the resources, and the shares were well. But can you talk about the five power brands that I think two of the shares were up, three were down? Can you just talk about how you manage those sales versus profitability just on an ongoing basis and taking innovation into the context of it? The second question is really on international. I know you have some international power brands out there, too, but can you talk a little bit more about the nine core brands and any plans in terms of incremental distribution that's not out there already?
Unidentified Company Representative : Correct me if I am wrong. But in the fourth quarter of the five other power brands three of them had share up two had share down the one with share down pricing situations one was extra actually which is our lowest priced laundry detergent has been hit hard by all the discounting going out there and we're fighting back and extra shares actually coming back and pretty much plus or minus now and then first response has been hit hard again by one of our competitors there's been a lot of deep discounting on pregnancy kits, so we're fighting back the share losses were minimal they weren't big at all innovation wise we're just as strong on those brands launching all new forms of products across those brands so I feel very strong but it's again we are putting more of a focus on the mega brands because the dollars family be a lot more brands. But we haven’t cut back that much on other still planning appropriately honestly we haven’t faced as much competition on an advertising basis in those categories as in the past some of our competitors have pulled back an advertising going into price. So we're trying to find the right balance.
Matt Farrell: Bruce could you comment on our vigilance with respect to share voice and share market?
Bruce Fleming: Yes I would just echo what Jim said and also what by focusing in the four mega brands we flowed our marketing and media support against those brands to drive them but also against the power brands that had innovation in a particular year okay so you'll see us calling audibles from year to year and even within a year typically we pick our stocks where we think we think we have the best innovation where we have the most competition and then we'll spend there. And add to Matt’s point over the years that I've been marketing I've really tried to extend it about share of voice to share market of about 200% index if not higher depending upon the category and if you are in wide space even more. So, we really look at our media budget as one that we are not stealing Peter to pay a Paul on a day-to-day basis, what we are doing is we are trying to figure out where we are going to optimize return for the shareholders. 
Matt Farrell: I would just add to into two examples like Jim said if they were both specific examples of highly aggressive competitive pricing activity, in both those cases.
Unidentified Analyst : On vitamins, if gummies are such a great category, why is it still only a single-digit percentage of the category in the adult area? Is there more that needs to be done in terms of promotion, marketing, et cetera? Why isn't there bigger --?
Unidentified Company Representative: The best answer to that is answer the vitamin category is not heavily advertised category. When we saw what happened a lot of competitors doing buy one get one free, they put lot of money in the promotion, they weren’t put the money in advertising so people just honestly were not aware to this day I meet people many adults I go to and say hey should we try a gummies vitamin actually my kids taken, I say no we haven’t for doctor like they have no idea. So I think this year we increased our advertising spending by 25% or some like that this year, there is still sort of a very low base the business we bought. So it’s something we came trying to raise the budget, and we are starting the promotional competition and that. Centrum is in there. One a Day is in there. The money has started to come through. And we do a lot of in-store trials, as I swear to god and he will be another Costco and things like that they got a pop gumming your mouth and that’s when like my doctor example, his mother-in-law, his 70 year mother-in-law taste the gummy she is like unconverted but she is never knew the exist before until I literally gave him a free bottle. 
Unidentified Company Representative: I would add that demographic wins in our favor too, because a lot of parents who have been giving their children gummies over the last 20 years which relatively new form of vitamin is now they are rich in age and they are thinking what can we do for ourselves, as a further parents. So we see great upside as Jim mentioned before on the 8% of the adult vitamin category is in the gummy form. So there is much more run way there. 
Unidentified Company Representative: Something 3 to 8 in just two years. I mean that have seen like but that’s pretty big shift overtime. We want to get the double-digits in 2015 and keep growing. So we are going to launching new forms stuff along, but the bigger thing is advertising and trials, driving trials because people just, it’s not a category like laundry detergent we spend a money it was never a big advertised category blame the competitors that it included company we bought they just a advertise at least the people does really won’t aware of it. And the kids did because the kids wouldn’t eat anything but a gummy and no problem taking they will take the hard pills they are used to it, the parents switched the kids to the gummies the kid would not eat the hard pills so that’s why gummies popular with kids but this is right. Our advertising target today is people who are parents of kids to ate gummies, because gummies because they are the like hey my kids and we find many times that parents were stealing the kid’s gummies out of the in the morning and popping a few, so that’s the case. We just got keep spending on the advertising keep driving the trial. 
Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then on organic sales I'm still trying to understand the gap between Q1's plus 3% versus the full year of 2% to 3%, because you made the commentary on the press release about how you expect US to get better. You've got a lot of incremental activity dedicated towards OxiClean which is hitting the top line in Q1. So, US is getting better, presumably you're taking some pricing in some of your international markets where you can, and slotting fees and all these incremental trade spending things should go down as the year progresses. So, what's the delta there? 
Unidentified Company Representative: The Q1 were same 3% but on full year percent 2 to 3. So there are two things one is Q1 authority has come so last year we were 1.4% organic. And they look at that is specialty products although all are going to 3%, they are going to coming like lion and act line lan. So they are going to do fairly well in the first quarter but they are coming back down to earth in a hurry. So they won’t look like Q4 specialty products but abilities in the first quarter. 
Unidentified Analyst : There was an article I think today about some retailers being charged with selling product that actually didn't have in it what it was supposed to. Which we were wondering if that would affect your vitamin business at all. Or if it's good for you because you can defend that, in fact, if people analyze what's in your vitamins they do what they say they do. Or if this is another negative piece of news for the category. I don't know if you saw the article. 
Unidentified Company Representative: I don’t think something we're very on top of, we're very careful that we put exactly in the vitamins what we say I am not going to comment on the competition, but we are aware but our quality control as we have stepped up spending on quality controls since we took over the business. The just to be clear that article by about urban products we don’t have in our product business and we to get something are products that we have couple of urban ingredient. So we are unaffected by that announcement. 
Unidentified Analyst : And then my second question just on product mix and the contribution of that to price mix and margin. If you see growth on your four power brands, mega brands, does that generally help margin? If you could just walk us through some of the big movers there.
Unidentified Company Representative: That will generally held margin , almost all of the power brands growth margin is slightly above the company average, some within, Arm & Hammer is the complex one, Arm & Hammer has some forms that are below company average, some above. It depends on that which ones are hotter colder at times but generally it’s a positive and TROJAN very high gross margin vitamin is little bit up company average another way to think about.
Unidentified Company Representative: Another way to think about household generally has lower gross margins, personal care higher, so you got look at our house personal care growing. The second piece of it house international growing, so that’s largely personal care business going to help you think about where you going to get gross margin expansion from.
Unidentified Company Representative: Mr. Travel came in late from Atlanta already there are some other more important companies we’re going do.
Unidentified Analyst: Did I miss the TSR chart?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, you do, you can come back.
Unidentified Analyst: I'll catch up on that. A couple questions on detergent. On OxiClean, I know you did go through it, but give me a state of state from you or Lou after the first year. Was 1% share what you were thinking? Where can it go? Is it priced right in terms of within the grand mix? And do you expect increased distribution even coming into this year or is the goal to hold it? And then on the bigger category -- and I'm sorry if you did talk about compaction -- are we still on plan for next year for the next round? And are there any costs associated in the back half of the year to make that transfer? 
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, I would tell you and I’ll let Lou jump in. I would tell you OXICLEAN laundry detergent came into ballpark where we expected, don’t forget we launched right into the peak of math and price war, so that made us pull back on the rest a little bit. The brand built nicely through the year. We’re going to again put continue trial level devices behind at this year to continue to grow share behind the business, so on down track it was set back by the price war which we didn’t expect that is the extended happened in 2013. So I know another year strong trial in OXICLEAN and then consumer feedback is outstanding. The consumer comments we get and the surveys we take are just outstanding, so the products after delivery -- we’re this year making minor tweak to in some cases sizes and fresh points I am going to get into that kind of detail but we’ll make some minor tweak there we think to make the brand more competitive out there. Lou do you want add anything?
Louis Tursi: Yes, the only thing I would add Bill is going in 2014 we knew from the beginning that this is going to be a multiyear launch it was going to be a one hit wonder. And we needed to spend behind it over a multiple years. Jim and Matt said earlier that’s exactly what we’re going to do and we’re fully guns blazing in 2015 again to help support that whole launch. We’re also introducing some new items and you asked how is the distribution going, it’s too early to tell we should wait here. But we’ve been fortunate of over the many years Jim has a chart in one of his early ones how we’ve grown distribution. So the retailers have been very supportive of all and innovation over the years. And so we’re very hopeful that although it’s still early at that to support all launches in 2015. On the compaction there has been nothing announced on compaction when the next round would be we’ll tell you our company would participate look forward to it, but I am not exactly sure it’s 2016.
Jim Craigie: Wal-Mart says in 2017 probably.
Unidentified Company Representative: It’s out.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Jim, when you look at the gross margin chart right over time, you cited, I think, 2004 until current in its really impressive gross margin expansion. But it struck me that most of that came through 2009. It's been extraordinary circumstances but since then the gross margin has been roughly flat. So, I was hoping you could walk through and explain what kind of an opportunity do you see in gross margin over time? And where does it come from? Is it more M&A dependent or can you really squeeze more out of the Company for a while?
Jim Craigie: You’re probably right since we’ve run a lot of price force and competitions since 2009 and that our goal is still long term to be 25% to 50% basis points of gross margin growth as we get start and we haven’t had a massive acquisition since 2009 of high level gross margin on that, but we still believe overtime we can gross margin on average 25% to 50% basis points, so that’s kind of our goal getting into there.
Unidentified Company Representative: Right and remember we said earlier Chris is that personal care is where the higher margin is, so that’s where you want to concentrate your growth in the future. And acquisitions one of standards that it has to be accretive to the corporate gross margin and that has certainly helped us overtime and needs to continue where we’re going to 50%.
Unidentified Company Representative: The only think I would add to it as Matt and Jim have said before that we’re enhancing our systems and so we’re looking forward through the systems enhancement how to improve our efficiencies within all levels of our spending trade coupon et cetera. So we’re looking forward other ways through enhancements of our systems moving forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Is there a brand in your portfolio today you see becoming the next mega brand? Or do you have to go out and buy one first? And, second, what's been the issue on the M&A side? Has it been all valuation or are there just not targets that are in your alley, effectively? 
Jim Craigie: I can’t answer the first it’s powerful based on some stuffs looking at one of our current other power brand looking mega brands possible, but I am not considering more than that. M&A environment is very interesting we’ve been very active I think I’ve said to you I’ve spent more time and my team spent more time in 2014 pursuing acquisitions they never before. One of the reasons I made this switch and promoted Matt to COO was besides the fact he’s been voted the number one CFO for like five straight years. He was get little bored. I want to spend more time looking at the acquisitions looking at the long term strategy in that and he was already running the day-to-day business anyway, so I gave him that promotion but allowed to me to spend more time with my team looking acquisitions. It’s an interesting markets. It’s interesting because acquisitions should be very hot, debt so cheap, everybody wants organic growth, wants the good sales growth in that. I would tell you generally sellers are little greedy. I will give you a roundabout case we had one this year within the ballpark of $0.5 billion acquisition price you're very interested in it, very high gross margin. We were told at the competitive bidding process, we got very deeply involved, we chased it in the end, we assessed a proper bid that was a little less than what the seller wanted, but that actually due diligence in using proper multiples in the marketplace for sales. And then we got a phone call saying you're out and somebody else can win the bid. So guess what's happened nobody's won the bid. It was bologna, there was nobody else in there and our bid was the best they didn’t get they want they pulled back which is what's going to happening in the M&A market to some extent so and I'm happy because I would have felt awful if we had raised our bid to giving what they want and then found out like some of our competitors have found out that they were the only one they got snickered by the investment bankers and they're paying a higher multiple that really wasn’t justified and really took a way lot of the accretion from the deal you can get so we're very diligent about that we spent a lot of time due diligence we pay a very fair price but in the end we're not going to just pay any price to win a bid and bringing the house say hey I'm in an acquisition not going to do that I'm very prudent about our shareholders money.  And the fact that I would say it factors and we've spent a lot of time and just other than the nicer small deals we've landed we're very happy about. We haven’t been able to land a big deal yet, but I'm not going to feel the pressure to do that until we find the right deal for the company because when we find them, you see the history the history is fantastic. We buy good businesses. Most of the things are on table there were acquisitions over the course for the last 10 years, 15 years we grow them, we build them, drive the company's earnings up, it’s a great story but we have our process, we have our rules, we have our due diligence it's unbelievable. We uncover stuff on deals sometimes its deal killers that some other guys don’t uncover sometime and we just we do our hard work, so we're working hard. We're working very hard on it, but can't tell you when I'm telling you we're just we're working as hard as I were to find the next great acquisition for the company and we have the money so I'm not going to just spend it on something that say the dumb acquisitions. More questions.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Jim, just to follow on to Joe's question there on M&A, we talked last year at CAGNY. Is there still a personal care bias with respect to M&A? And then I think ideally you were saying at the time that the right asset could potentially have a footprint in both the US and international where you could recognize higher cost synergies but maybe expand the footprint internationally. But maybe reconcile that today with some of the commentary around the stronger dollar, et cetera. 
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes I mean as Matt said several times our personal care acquisition almost always comes with higher gross margin, OxiClean a household business came with personal care type margins but yes I mean generally we'd love to buy a business with the best possible gross margin yet that's generally personal care business but honestly I'm quite agnostic about also by a great household business to your second point's kind of interesting because of what's happened in currencies right now, everybody in their brother is looking for a U.S. based acquisitions. So U.S. based acquisitions have become very hot because the dollar situation the foreign currencies so maybe a little more competition there I somewhat look at that as maybe there's good opportunity get a great buy on a foreign company and things like that so we haven’t cut back it all on our look around the whole globe for good acquisitions paying a fair price for them, so I mean we're just out there trying our best to find the right deal out there. But I mean you haven’t seen that many acquisitions happen honestly in the industry it's been kind of quiet I think honestly part of it is because the stock market has still been so strong I think a lot of Boards are sitting there going hey yes organic growth is not good hey yes we got problems but hey the stock's up 20% what's the problem and let's not go make the big deal on that so I think to fight being super cheap it's a perfect time to take debt leverages out there there's a lot of companies are sitting back and just saying I'm not going to make the move because there are no perfect deals out there the perfect little company with the one brand that you just want to add your portfolio it's usually a company that's got a great business and then a lot of we call hair a lot of things you don’t want to buy that are added they’re selling you the whole bundle and a lot of our competitors we believe have stepped back and said we don’t feel the need to go out and buy that bundle and bring it in the house here because things are good stock price is up a bit, so it's I think most investment bankers despite telling you it’s a very good year overall for deals we'd tell you they've got to be much bigger year for deals in that so everybody still looking at maybe the currency has caught more focus on the U.S. based companies selling but I don’t know we're just active we're very active I'm very tired looking for deals, so we're working hard on them. All right I'd like to do one thing special here today before we sign off. There's a personal room today one of your colleagues who's retiring after many years in the business often times rated a 5-star analyst Alice Longley in the back of room there. She just announced her retirement recently gift for Alice today is something for first time ever we've done this Alice come on up here for a second. As we do with all of you, we consider you all good friends, Alice sometimes we call the dentist because she would drill us on earnings calls on every line of the P&L until she had an answer then she would ask us again, so Alice what I have for you today is something I want you to open it up to show the crew here, Bill you’ll get a big kick out of this. Who wrapped this? Somebody with a knife open it up -- and then you'll get arrested going outside but what we have here is a chart that we have only ever gave through, we only ever given before to retiring members of Church & Dwight either staff or Board of Directors and what the charts shows us outside of the covering our company September 29, 1998 she put a buy on us. And what this chart shows is what’s happened to Church & Dwight’s stock price since that time versus the S&P 500. And you invested a $1000 when Alex told you that’s a $1000 back on September 29, 1999 and held it for today that $1000 to be worth $11041. If you invest that $1000 to S&P 500 it would be worth only $1615. So there you can see you get that over there. There you can see the total shareholder of Church & Dwight stock price if listen to certain analysts. And there you can see if you invest money into S&P 500. So this probably goes in the walls of all the retiring members of our company and our Board of Directors and we wanted you to have it too my dear, thank you. 
Unidentified Company Representative: She said she would try to down grade us on success few times but we still succeeded. So anyway we love you and good luck in retirement. For the rest of you today we showed you our plans, we feel very proud the results we turned in 2014, 2015 we think our outlook is right on the button going forward a very tough year of all the foreign stuff going out but we are going to deliver outstanding results compared to our competitors or often negative EPS numbers call for next when you take your currencies in to effect, deliver you 8% real reported EPS next year, which I think half of the pack of the industry. So with that I thank you for coming on a very difficult weather day and please get home safe and sound, thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jim Craigie - Chairman and CEO Matt Farrell - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Bill Chappell - SunTrust Michael Steib - Crédit Suisse Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Jason English - Goldman Sachs Kevin Grundy - Jefferies Wendy Nicholson - Citi Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Caroline Levy - CLSA Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets Jason Gere - KeyBanc Olivia Tong - Bank of America 
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I’ve been asked to remind you that on this call, the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in the detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Jim Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It’s always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have great results to report. I’ll start off this call by providing you with my overview of our third quarter business results, which you’ve read about in our press release this morning. I’ll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, who will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I’ll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We’ll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I’m very proud of my team for delivering excellent third quarter business results in such a difficult business environment. Despite continuing headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures, Church & Dwight achieved 4.7% organic sales growth in Q3, driven by record share results on all four of our mega brands. In combination with continued tight control of overhead cost, the company delivered a 30 basis-point increase in operating margin and a 12% increase in earnings per share. On a year-to-date basis, our organic sales growth is right in line with our annual target of 3%. So the excellent results from the first three quarters of 2014 makes us feel confident in achieving our aggressive annual EPS growth target of 8%, which would place us in the top quartile of EPS growth for the entire CPG industry. I am also pleased to report that we’ve completed the acquisition of several leading women’s healthcare brands from the Lil’ Drug Store Products Company. This acquisition meets the company’s acquisition criteria which have been a key driver of our consistently strong EPS growth. We expect the acquisition to be earnings neutral in 2014 and accretive to earnings per share in 2015. Let me assure that we are continuing to aggressively pursue acquisitions. I’ll now turn the call over to Matt to give you some specific details on our third quarter results and then I’ll return to give you some further insights of results of our key brands and provide additional details and my outlook for the year.
Matt Farrell: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everybody. I’m going to start with EPS. Third quarter EPS was $0.85 per share that compares with $0.76 in 2013, that’s up 12% from a year ago. And the $0.85 was better than our $0.80 to $0.82 outlook and netted in our $0.85. There is a penny drag from FX year-over-year. We also got a penny of help versus our 34% targeted tax rate. As far as revenues go, reported revenues were up 4.6% to $842 million. Organic sales were 4.7% exceeding our Q3 outlook of 3% organic sales. And the organic sales [beat] was largely driven by the success of new products and continued strength in our animal nutrition business. Of the 4.7% organic growth, approximately 5.2% is due to volume with 50 basis points of negative product mix and pricing. Now let’s review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business’ organic sales increased by 3.5%, volume growth contributed 4.3% to organic sales that was partially offset by 80 basis points of negative effect of product mix and price. Our personal care brands had a really good quarter, up 4.9% in total. TROJAN, NAIR, SPINBRUSH and VITAFUSION vitamins all had quarters. Household was up 2.8%, driven by ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL Cat Litter and OXICLEAN Liquid Laundry Detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of XTRA laundry detergent, L’IL CRITTERS vitamins and ARM & HAMMER unit dose laundry detergent. Going on to international. International organic growth was up 1.7%, volume increased approximately 3.1% and unfavorable product mix and pricing was a drag of 1.4%. We had strong growth in the UK and Mexico, but that was largely offset by a weakness in Canada. Turning now to our Specialty Products division; organic sales increased by 22.1%. The animal nutrition business drove 18.2% volume increase with favorable mix and pricing contributing 3.9%. With respect to that favorable pricing, remember that the favorable pricing is attributable to passing through raw material price increases to our customers. Currently, the U.S. dairy industry is very healthy, experiencing near high, no crisis and low input costs, which are driving demand for our products. We expect total company organic sales to be approximately 3% now for the year. Turning now to gross margin, our reported third quarter gross margin was 43.7% that’s 170 basis points contraction from year ago, which is slightly more than 150 basis points contraction that we expected. This was driven primarily by higher trade spending and higher commodity costs. For the full year, we still expect gross margin to contract approximately 75 basis points. And with respect to commodities year-over-year input costs trended up in Q3 year-over-year in particular due to resin. Now let’s talk about marketing. Our marketing spend was front-end loaded this year to support all the great new products during the launch. As we said in August, the second half spend is as expected, lower versus a year ago. We continue to monitor our marketing spending on the basis of our share of voice versus our share of market, so we watch that very closely. And we are comfortable with those ratios. With respect to quarterly marketing spend for the third quarter was at $96.6 million or 11.5% of revenues and that’s a 90 basis point decline from the prior year spend rate and $3.1 million lower on the dollar spend rate. We funded some of the Q3 promotional actions that we talked about in August with lower marketing in Q3. SG&A: SG&A was low year-over-year by $4 million; as a percentage of net sales, it was 11.1% which is 110 basis-point decrease from the prior year third quarter. And as a result, our reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.1% which was 30 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% that compares to last year’s 33.9%; and we continue to expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be approximately 34%. Cash flow is next. We generated $408.7 million of net cash from operations for the first nine months of 2014, and we invested $36 million year-to-date in CapEx. And we expect to spend approximately $70 million on CapEx for full year 2014. Cash from operations is expected to exceed $525 million and free cash flow is expected to exceed $450 million. Regarding buybacks, we have approximately 149 remaining on our authorization, and we may decide to get ahead of 2015 share creep in December of this year. Now, I want to talk about the acquisition that Jim mentioned in his opening remarks. The company completed the acquisition of REPHRESH, REPLENS and other brands from Lil’ Drug Store on September 19th. We met all of our previously stated acquisition criteria. The brands are number one in their niche categories; they’re asset-light and what that means is the products are co-packed. And we believe it has growth potential and the gross margin is accretive to the company’s gross margin. Annual trailing sales of these brands are $46 million and the $260 million acquisition was initially financed with commercial paper. A little more color on this. So, REPHRESH is a number one gel for pH balance and vaginal health, and REPLENS is the number one gel to address vaginal dryness which is a common issue for menopausal age women. We expect them to grow at or above our 3% to 4% growth target and these brands fit nicely into our global women’s health portfolio. And many of you may not know that in our international division, we have a vaginal care brand called Femfresh which is about $20 million brand. Now into some numbers, trailing EBITDA was approximately $17 million. If you do the math on that this is an EBITDA margin of 37% and that would also equate to an EBITDA multiple that we paid of 12 times. So, since this is an asset deal, as many of you know, there is tax shield. So, after taking into account $55 million tax shield and the minor amount of cost synergies, the multiple is actually less the 9%, 8.9% which coincidently is the same fully synergized multiple that we paid for the Avon business in 2012. So, once these brands are fully integrated, the company expects to leverage distribution network and the support functions to generate some additional cost savings. The acquisition is expected to be earnings neutral to 2014 EPS and approximately $0.02 accretive to earnings per share in 2015 that’s inclusive of two things, financing costs and amortization of intangibles. If we add back the amortization of intangibles that’s about $8 million bucks, the acquisition is expected to be approximately $0.06 accretive to cash earnings per share. And with respect to the financing that’s noted in there, although there are no guarantees, we expect to refinance the commercial paper borrowings with the longer-term instrument at market rates sometime in the future. I’m going to wrap it up now. The third quarter highlights include 4.7% organic sales and 12% EPS growth. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.78, compared to $0.65 per share last year which is a 20% increase. As Jim has said and will say, we had an impairment charge and litigation costs in Q4, 2013 that aren’t expected to repeat; and this year, we have lower shares, and combined that makes up 10% of the 20% increase in the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 3% and marketing as a percentage of sales goes to approximately 12.2% for Q4; 12.2% is also our full year marketing target right now. As we mentioned in the release, we’re tightening our full year EPS range from 7% to 9%, to 8%. Then just one last thing for those of you who are working on your models, on a full year basis, we expect 3% organic sales growth; gross margin contraction of 75 basis points, obviously influenced by slotting and couponing behind new products; as we work our way down to P&L, we now expect marketing at 12.2% of sales for the full year that’s given our Q3 actions and expect SG&A to be down a 100 basis points to 12%, will get you to a 50 basis points of operating margin expansion for full year 2014. And now back to you Jim.
Jim Craigie: Okay. Thanks, Matt. I’ll finish off our call today by adding a little color to the third quarter results which Matt just took you through, and my outlook for the year. At the beginning of this year, I told you that Church & Dwight plan for 2014 was based on the belief that innovation was the key to driving our organic sales growth and reviving category growth in this challenging global economy. To back up this belief, we launched a record number of new products in every one of our major categories and three new categories. These new product launches were focused on our 4 megabrands and 5 other power brands. These 9 brands in total represent over 80% of our sales and profits. In the first quarter of 2014, our sales force did an incredible job in gaining incremental distribution from retailers in every category. Gaining incremental distribution is the key first step for driving future sales and profit growth, so we got off to a great start. In the second quarter, our goal was to initiate strong consumer demand for the new products via increased marketing support. We also met this goal, as we achieved record quarterly share results on 3 of our 4 megabrands and share gains on 3 of our 5 other power brands. In the current third quarter, our innovation driven strategy continue to gain momentum driven by record share results on all 4 of our megabrands and 3 of our 5 other power brands. And as we had hoped, our innovations have had a positive effect on category growth as well. The weighted average of all of our categories has gone from minus 0.8% versus year ago in the first quarter to flat versus year ago in the second quarter and to plus 0.8% in the third quarter. While this weighted average is still below, pre-recessional levels of 2% to 4%, it is headed in the right direction. I would now like to share some of the specific third quarter results on our key brands. Among our 9 key brands, our biggest focus in 2014 was on turning the OXICLEAN brand into a megabrand by extending it into 3 new categories: premium laundry detergent, bleach alternatives and automatic dishwashing detergents. Overall, this strategy is off to a great start as consumption of the total OXICLEAN brand in the third quarter was up 35% versus year ago. This included strong results on every form of the brand. The OXICLEAN laundry additive product achieved a record third quarter share of 43.8%, which is more than the next 3 competitors combined. This represents the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year share growth for our core OXICLEAN laundry additive brand. The new OXICLEAN premium liquid laundry detergent achieved a 1.2% dollar share in the third quarter in the $5 billion liquid laundry category after just seven months in distribution. This represents a 20% increase in sales versus the prior quarter. Most importantly, our consumer research reveals that the sales of our new OXICLEAN premium liquid laundry detergent brand are over 80% incremental to our other liquid laundry detergents. Our new OXICLEAN auto dish detergent achieved a 2.4% dollar share in the third quarter and has surpassed Colgate-Palmolive brand to become the number three player in the auto dish category. And our OXICLEAN bleach alternative, called White Revive achieved a 2.4% dollar share in the third quarter. Distribution of White Revive was almost entirely incremental as we were able to get it placed in the bleach section rather than laundry detergent section where the core OXICLEAN laundry additive product is located. As a result, sales of White Revive are over 70% incremental to the core OXICLEAN laundry additive franchise. The strong sales incrementality of our new product is critical to achieving sales growth. Our other megabrands also achieved strong results in the third quarter. Our newest megabrand, the VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamin business, delivered high single-digit consumption growth in the third quarter, behind expanded distribution, new products and increased marketing support. We achieved this high single-digit consumption growth despite only 1% overall category growth as a result of unfavorable publicity late last year about the benefit from taking multivitamins. The 1% overall category growth for vitamins is actually encouraging news as it represents steady improvement from a negative 2.2% category decline in the first quarter and a flat category in the second quarter. We are optimistic that the vitamin category will soon return to its historic mid single-digit growth levels driven by new products and solid marketing spending by all competitors that reinforce the proven benefits from taking vitamins. Notably, Church & Dwight’s vitamin business plays in the fast growing gummy form of vitamins, which now represents 7% of the total vitamin category that is more than double what it was when we bought the business in 2012 and that still leads 93% of the $7 billion vitamin category to be conquered by encouraging consumers to switch from swallowing tasteless hard pills to enjoying delicious tasty gummy vitamins. We have the number one gummy brand for both kids and adults, and Church & Dwight was one of only two vitamin brands to show share growth in the third quarter. These strong results to-date in our gummy vitamin business had built us to put us on track to deliver our strong sales growth outlook of the year despite lower than expected category growth and increased competition. On our TROJAN megabrand, we achieved a record third quarter share in the total sexual health category, driven by record quarterly sales of condoms and continued growth of our new lubricant line that was launched in 2013. On the largest part of our sexual health business, our TROJAN condom business, we achieved a record quarterly share of 76.6%. Our steady stream of new condom products and strong marketing programs has led to the TROJAN brand representing 26 of the top 30 [fuse] in the category. Our biggest megabrand, ARM & HAMMER, grew its share in the third quarter despite significant price competition. In the laundry detergent category, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a record quarterly share of 10.3%. This share growth represents the 19th consecutive quarter that the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent brand has posted year-on-year share growth. This share growth has also strengthened the brand’s number one position in the value segment and has enabled the ARM & HAMMER brand to pass the ALL brand to become the number three brand in the total laundry detergent category. While these were very positive results for the ARM & HAMMER brand, the real star of the ARM & HAMMER mega brand portfolio was our cat litter business. Our new premium price cat litter, called ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL, has been a huge hit with consumers, as reflected in both our brand’s share results and its positive impact on category growth. Our third quarter consumption for our ARM & HAMMER cat litter business increased by over 20% for the second consecutive quarter and our share grew 2.5 points to a record third quarter share of 22.5%. These great share results strengthen our position as the number two brand in the category. Just as important, our new CLUMP & SEAL product has been a major contributor to driving cat litter category sales growth of over 8%, the strongest growth in any of our 13 categories and excellent growth for any CPG category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key to driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. Unfortunately, some of our competitors have not invested in developing new products and instead have increased their trade and coupon spending to defend their brands. This has been happening in several categories, particularly the laundry detergent category. As you know, Church & Dwight is the only competitor to grow share in the laundry detergent category for every year for the past five years. We are now the number two player in the category, and one out of every four wash loads is done with a Church & Dwight laundry detergent. The growth of our laundry detergent business has been driven by value pricing, great new products, increased distribution and higher marketing spending. As I stated earlier, our largest liquid laundry detergent brand, ARM & HAMMER, has posted year-on-year share growth for 19 consecutive quarters, including share growth in the first third quarters of 2014. Our OXICLEAN laundry additives brand has posted year-on-year share growth for 12 consecutive quarters and achieved a record quarterly share in the third quarter. In 2014, we launched innovative new products on our ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent brand. And to continue our remarkable record of share growth, we also extended the OXICLEAN brand into the laundry detergent category, with solid results as I mentioned earlier. Overall, Church & Dwight’s total laundry detergent business achieved a record quarterly dollar share of 14.7% in the third quarter. In a liquid detergents category which represents over 70% of total laundry detergent sales, Church & Dwight achieved an all time record quarterly share of 17.5%, driven by record quarterly share on the ARM & HAMMER brand and the incremental share delivered by our new OXICLEAN liquid laundry detergent products. Hopefully, our laundry detergent competitors will come to share or belief that launching innovative new products is the preferred method of competition for both our consumers and retailers. We are anticipating a more normalized promotional environment starting in this quarter. I will finish off our portion of the call today with a few words and our outlook for the year. As stated in the press release, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance of organic sales growth of approximately 3% and we are tightening our annual earnings growth target to 8%. This will be driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead cost. Our 8% earnings growth target is in the upper quartile of EPS growth target ranges in the CPG industry consistent with our historical performance. And we are highly confident that we can deliver this aggressive target given the strong momentum exiting Q3. I also want to once again assure you that we are actively pursuing additional acquisitions and have over $2 billion of financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective about the type of businesses we acquire. At the same time, we are also fiscally responsible to our shareholders, so we will continue to be patient until we find the right deals that will pay dividends for many years to come. Now before opening the call to questions, I’d like to mention of organizational announcement that we made this morning. I’m pleased to announce that Farrell will be assuming a broader leadership role within the company. In addition to his current role as Church & Dwight’s Chief Financial Officer in which he has a superb track record, Matt will also become our Chief Operating Officer with all line functions reporting to him. This expanded role will enable Matt to leverage his terrific depth knowledge of organization and the CPG industry to continue to build on the company’s outstanding track record of results. This organizational change will also allow me to focus more time on long-term corporate strategy and finding accretive acquisitions. In conclusion, 2014 is shaping up to be another very challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your best in the company with the product portfolio and new product pipeline that can thrive in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver consistently strong EPS growth. That ends our presentation. I’ll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank:  Hey. Just kind of looking at the organic growth guidance and obviously came better this quarter, but you only kept a 3% for the year. So was there anything that was pull forward from the fourth quarter? Do you think you will be conservative in the fourth quarter, kind of what’s changed relative to when we spoke last?
Matt Farrell:  Yes, Bill. It’s Matt. As you know, the specialty products business has been flying pretty high and Q4, they’re going to be coming down earth. So, that’s one of the reasons why it’s going to be lower sequentially. In Q3, as you know, we took actions to particularly in the laundry category which we talked about on the last call, was actions we decided upon in May; June got a lot better year-over-year followed by July, August and September. So that kinds Q3 was influenced by those, but it seems though we expect the relatively normalized commercial line in Q4 so that’s also reflected in our top-line.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. And then it seems like you’re a lot more sanguine about the laundry category and the price for them also happened earlier last year. Do you have a sense really kind of like what the planned outlook looks like for next year and what some of the pricing conversations have been, is that why you’re a little more optimistic?
Jim Craigie: No, I think Bill we don’t have any information to share on that. We’re trying to just provide context on our expectation based on what we’re seeing right now. I would just say two facts kind of support that context. One is that improvement in the overall laundry detergent category. The category is still down, it was down 2.3% in Q3, but that’s better than the 3.8% decline in Q1 versus a year ago and the 3.5% decline in Q2. So, we’re seeing improvement in the category and also the promoted price per wash load for liquid laundry detergent was higher in Q3. And keep in mind liquid is still 70% of the business. So we’re seeing some trends, which we like.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Got you. And then just a follow-up on that, I mean does XTRA have to work for laundry to really be [pluming] because that’s the only brand that you wanted to really take a chance a little bit, it hasn’t really kind of does job recently. So I guess is there plan there and do you guys need that brand to work for the broader laundry business to work?
Jim Craigie: Well, we have a portfolio now Bill of three laundry detergent brands and every one of them is important. And we have plans in place to make XTRA do better going forward and I’m not going to reveal those. But yes, it’s a part of our portfolio, but we’re working on it. Overall the portfolio is showing great record share results and XTRA was down a little bit, but we have plans going forward to make that better.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: And congrats, Matt. One time comment, it’s well deserved. Thank you, guys.
Matt Farrell: Thanks Bill.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning. Actually going after that last one, Matt congratulations as well, but can you tell us kind of what the difference is of what you’re doing day-to-day, Jim, other than Matt obviously getting a longer business card?
Jim Craigie: Yes. Well, Bill all I’d say is two key drivers for our fast success, and then we’ve got a very experienced management team and I carefully leverage that team overtime to meet the changing needs of our customers and consumers and to meet the competitive environment that we face in order to live our great business results. Right now, I wanted build more time to three things; one, long-term corporate strategy; two, acquisitions; and three, developing the organization’s capabilities. I need more time to do that, it’s enabled me to do that. I’ve asked Matt to step up and handle the additional duties of COO. He will be overseeing and coordinating the day-to-day execution of our business. That leverages his last 8 years of experience as our CFO, which he has been involved in all aspects of the business. Matt, as you guys know; and I appreciate for the incredible Job as our CFO. He is in a position to take on additional responsibilities because he has developed a world class financial team. So, in my mind this evolution of our management structure is what the company needs right now. Going forward, I’ll continue to make changes in the future if needed to continue deliver outstanding business results. So that’s what’s going on.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then switching to the operations on the laundry that you’re anticipating the promotional environment getting better this quarter, are you already seeing that in October or did you already see that in October and kind of what gives you comfort, I mean assuming most of these plans were put in place months ago. Should we expect it to get better sequentially?
Jim Craigie: I don’t want to go in detail, Bill, but yes, we’re continuing to see some positive things happening. But it’s still early in the fourth quarter.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then, Matt, just as we look out to 2015, I know it’s not big, but based on spot rates today, what’s kind of the currency headwind on your EPS guidance?
Matt Farrell: Thanks for throwing me that beach ball, Bill.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: You’re still the CFO.
Matt Farrell: Yes, right. Current spot rates we calculate to be almost 1.5% drag on EPS. And that’s best baked into our thinking still a high single-digits. So, where it is true that we have an acquisition and it’s going to help us by $0.02 next year, we got more than $0.02 going the other way at current spot rates for FX.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Crédit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael Steib - Crédit Suisse: Good morning. Just a question on the operating margin improvements, SG&A productivity since they’ve been driving a lot of the improvement in the quarter, I was wondering what’s behind that. Is that just your general productivity program and what is the sustainability of that progress?
Matt Farrell: Hi Michael, this is Matt. While we expect to sustain the year-over-year dollar saving, it’s a combination of a lot of things. You may recall back at the -- in February when we closed the year that we expected a 100 basis points of help year-over-year from SG&A and that’s because of our vigilance with respect to headcount, in fact we had put it in SAP system two years ago now, we continued to try to leverage. We’re far more progressive than any other [CPD] company with respect to how we manage medical and dental cost; in fact our medical and dental costs are down year-over-year as a result of us going to a private exchange. You won’t find many companies that have -- that did that as of 01-01-2014. So, when I think about 2015, you’re trying to get at the sustainability of the SG&A. improvement. So, we expect to sustain the dollar save. And as you think about our algorithm, you can grow this company 3% top-line. So, if your reported number is 3% top line growth and you can keep a lid on SG&A. So if SG&A can grow 1% or less, you’re going to get 25 basis points of leverage. So that’s half of the 50 basis points of operating margin leverage that we’d be looking for. That’s the simple way to think about it.
Michael Steib - Crédit Suisse: Yes, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Hi. Good morning. My question is a follow-up to the fourth quarter guidance, so 3% organic sales growth. We understand Specialty is coming down. Can you tell us more about the Domestic Consumer business we just had 3.5% but we’re going into the toughest comp of the year for Domestic Consumer and there is less promotional support. So I’m just wondering if that Domestic Consumer goes down to 2% or something like that.
Jim Craigie: The way I think about it, Alice, is the last couple of quarters, the Specialty Products business has generated more than 1% of our growth. So, if you went back to Q3 for example of that 4.7%, the Specialty Products business was – number is around 1.5% of that. That’s not going to repeat in the fourth quarter. So when you think about 3% fourth quarter organic growth, the simple way to explain it is that SPD is going to grow, Specialty Products will be less than 1% of Q4 year-over-year, which means the Consumer business is going to be higher. But as far as my ability to tell you exactly what it’s going to be, I’ve whiffed on that last couple of quarters, so that’s as close as I can get it right now.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay. You don’t mean the Specialty is going to be up 1%, you just mean that it’s adding one…
Jim Craigie: Yes, right. Weighted average, how much that they contribute to the curve.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Yes. Okay, and then by another follow-up, how much were your detergents overall up or not in the third quarter? And that includes all the brands and all the forms including powders. Thanks.
Jim Craigie: Yes. Alice, our share was up 0.1% which was the same as Procter and again which competitors were down on a share basis.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: So, that means your detergents were down a little bit because the category was down?
Matt Farrell: Roughly plus or minus, just to give you an exact number that way around, but I’m going to give you exact number; I want to go check beginning on that one; you’re asking for specific numbers on specific category that’s a double check.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay. And then I guess one final one, you haven’t talked about the JV and equity income and that was better than I thought. And could you bring us up-to-date on what’s happening there and what the outlook is maybe for next year?
Jim Craigie: Well, I can’t tell you what is going to be for next year, as far as the full year this year; we expect it to land around 16 million bucks if that helps you, full year 2014?
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: And what’s going on there, why is it growing?
Matt Farrell: It’s cyclical. You do businesses that go up and down. So, if you look at our Ks for the last few years, you’re going to see that it’s driven by the end market, and their input costs, so some end markets are positive right now in that JV. But I wouldn’t say that I would count on there for next year just yes, we’ll update you, everyone.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay, good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning. 
Jim Craigie: Hi Connie.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: It looks as though the litter market is going towards light weight litters and I am wondering where you are in the development of such a product.
Matt Farrell: I don’t want to announce it and can’t even before we do it. I would just say, we continue to rock and roll on Cat Litter. I think the month of October has just rolled in and we’re up actually 34% over a year ago. So, we continue to do very well. And again, I just have a policy of not announcing new product launches before actually they hit the market. Our competitors like to tip us off, but we don’t do that.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And can you give us your outlook for resin, I think you noted that have negative contributor to the gross margin. A lot of people are expecting resin cost to go down and to follow oil. But what’s your opinion?
Jim Craigie: Yes. What happens with resin, Connie, is that there is less of a correlation with the oil than there used to be historically. So, it seems to be more related to capacity suppliers and outages both planned and unplanned. So, resin is still super high. I know somebody wrote a note about resin coming down, love to see that happen because that looks certainly benefit from that next year, but it would thinking away to see right now.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And just final thing. On gross margin expansion for next year, what would be the contributor to it?
Matt Farrell: Well, remember this week Jim talked about new products this year was a biggest year in years as far as the number of new products that we’ve launched. And along with that came lots of slotting and couponing to stimulate trial. So, next year will be -- we always have great years and next year will be a good year, but we won’t have as many of launches next year in 2015, ‘14 consequently have what we are slotting and couponing and obviously that gives you a bit of a tailwind for gross margin.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning folks.
Matt Farrell: Hey Jason.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs: Sorry, kind of still off the call there for a bit of time, so I may ask or redone a question, if so I apologize in advance. But I want to pick up that last line of question just done on costs and margins. Good organic sales growth this quarter, bad gross margin performance. You’re calling for an inflection to gross margin expansion next quarter. Can you think that can be sustained as you go to the next year and if so, what are some of the puts and takes?
Matt Farrell: We just talked about the gross margin for next year being influenced by lower slotting and couponing, I don’t know, if you heard that or not, Jason, because we have so many new product launches this year in particular OXICLEAN and that’s going to peel back a bit next year. So that’s a natural lift to gross margin in 2015 versus 2014. As far as gross margin goes, Q3 to Q4, it’s sequentially a better. You’d probably saw in the release and Jim has made some remarks about that that we expect a more normalized promotional environment, but I comment this with respect in Q4. So we come in 15 or 16 there, but that seems to be the trend right now.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks that’s helpful. And Jim, real quick, usually when we see a COO named, it precedes CEO succession, what’s the likelihood of that happening here?
Jim Craigie: Well, I’m a young 61, someday I will retire, but so that’s all there right now you’re getting out how do your speech is there as far as I’m concerned.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs: All right. Good. Thanks a lot guys. I’ll pass it on.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jim Craigie: Good morning.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies: And Matt, I wanted to extend my congratulations to you as well.
Matt Farrell: Thanks Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies: From a capital allocation perspective, Jim, maybe you can touch on this. So, with respect to M&A, is it that you’re seeing assets that you think make strategic sense and the multiples are just too high? And then alternatively, how should we be thinking about buyback with respect to ‘15 and sort of going forward understanding what you said about share creep here in the remainder of the year? Should we be anticipating something similar perhaps a front-end weighted sort of buyback in’15 understanding that it’s a Board decision?
Jim Craigie: Yes Kevin, I’ll address the acquisition environment and let Matt take the share buyback. I would just say it’s a very active environment out there. And it’s more a case of we’re just looking for as I said in my comments for acquisitions that fit our criteria, we’re being selective as we’ve always been and when we make deals, they have long-term benefit in terms of being accretive. So, there is a lot. Again one of the reasons I want to spend more time to be able to pursue these and chase them down because it’s a very active environment, but an environment which we want to be very careful in. We don’t want to repay and we want to make the right long-term deal and it takes a lot of focus to do that. So that’s one the reasons for giving Matt the additional duty of COO. I’ll let Matt to address the share buyback.
Matt Farrell:  Yes. On buybacks, Kevin, remember when we started the year we had $500 million of cash on the balance sheet, Jan 01, ‘14. And you know we’re a bit cash flow generator. So, we were somewhat opportunistic this year and be able to deploy that cash not having found large enough acquisitions that we thought met our criteria. So, we bought that $430 million of stock this year. So, I wouldn’t expect that to repeat because the highest and best use of our cash flow is acquisitions. So, the one thing we would commit to is that we would try to address share creep for 2015 and number that’s around $85 million of buybacks.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies: Okay. And then if I may just one more. And without asking you guys, this is with respect to the product pipeline for ‘15 and understanding you’re not going to front run any new innovation I guess that. But maybe you could just sort of help us sort of prioritize where you think the greatest opportunity is; you called out OXI, where are we I guess in sort of like what inning would you say with OXI in terms of looking at categories that could extend to TROJAN and also the gummy vitamin business and brand extensions there? That’s it from me. Thank you.
Jim Craigie: Yes, thanks Kevin. I would just say two things: One, our focus going forward will always be to give the strongest support to our four mega brands; and two we’re going to continue to strongly support the major new product launches we made this year. But as Matt referred to, we won’t have to pay slotting fees and we won’t be at introductory coupon levels next year; we’ll just be in of ongoing level. So we’re going to continue to drive the growth. We’re happy with the start; it’s going very well, but we know we need to continue that next year and we’ll be launching of new products on especially on our mega brands next year.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Your line is open. 
Wendy Nicholson - Citi: Hi. Just a couple follow-ups. 
Jim Craigie: Hi Windy.
Wendy Nicholson - Citi: Hi. The guidance for the fourth quarter includes a little bit of the incremental share repurchases pulling forward from next year, is that clear or would that be on top of which you’ve already guided us for?
Matt Farrell: No, that’s not baked in right now.
Wendy Nicholson - Citi: Okay, fine.
Matt Farrell: I’ll tell you, Windy, but that’s another way we manage the places; we’re always looking for ways to spend back more on media with our brands; to that extent that we did buyback, we probably spend back any of that incremental profits in marketing. 
Wendy Nicholson - Citi: Got it. Okay, fantastic. And then can you quantify, I know there have been a couple of questions about the gross margin and the guidance for 75 bps contraction in 2014. How much of that is the slotting fees? Is it 50 bps or 100 bps, just to try to sort of in our own mind add that back and think about where the gross margin is going to go next year?
Matt Farrell: Let’s wait till we get to the end of year and we’re going to call that. So in February, we’ll give you the detail on how much of that was in 2014 and what the tailwind is for ‘15.
Wendy Nicholson - Citi: Okay, terrific. That’s all I had. Thanks so much.
Jim Craigie: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.Your line is open.
Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo: Hey, thanks guys. I guess the message changed a little on the buyback. I know the last quarter you said don’t expect us to busy any more stock back, now you are saying you pull some forward for share creep. So, I’m just curious is that because of what has happened in the M&A environment relative to what you had expected?
Matt Farrell: No because of the M&A market at all, this is question of do you do it in December or do you do it in January and February, typically do it -- do it we do it front end loaded. So, we’ll just do that in December. But like I said, it’s not going to have an impact our full year ‘14 and a month isn’t going to change -- make a difference with respect o 2015. But we haven’t made that call yet.
Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then looking on guidance, I know Matt you guys always do good job of managing the next quarter guidance pretty carefully. But when I run the numbers that you are looking for through, there seems to be more flexibility into that Q4 EPS numbers than I’m used to I guess. And I’m wondering if there is anything, maybe I’m not thinking about that will be an incremental drag next quarter that would cause you to only earn what your guidance is relative to the individual components you guys gave out?
Matt Farrell: Could you be more specific about?
Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo: Yes. So, I mean when you run marketing being a 12% 2 for the year and SG&A being at 12% and organic at 3%, you get to an EPS number that’s bigger than what you’re guiding to and by a little bit more of a margin than normally?
Matt Farrell: Yes. We always have puts and takes in a quarter, lots of variables and none of which we will go into today on the call. Mike, as you correctly point out as for quarter ahead and for the full year we’re always pretty careful about what our expectations are so we can help people either way to the numbers. So, the big variable is always going to be the top-line too. That’s the one that’s hardest to call marketing in SG&A and is within our control, but certainly promotional environment and the top-line are not. And although, we might say we expect a relatively normalized promotional environment, it’s still early.
Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning and congratulations Matt.
Matt Farrell: Hi. Thanks.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: My questions are; number one, if you could say what’s going on in Canada and whether you expect that to reverse? And number two, on [home care], are there other areas that you can expand into. Can you tell us a little bit about that category and how we should think about growth rates for the category?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Canada is extremely competitive promotional environment right now. Some retailers up there are very aggressive with respect to promotions and who will remain nameless. It’s more or less the (inaudible) of the U.S. And so it’s the 10% of the U.S. sales in the Canada versus U.S. It’s our most important subsidiary, but we’ve had struggles up there with respect to competition this year.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Okay. So retailers rather than the manufactures?
Matt Farrell: Not obviously the retailers there, it’s just we have to compete, right? So, you got to compete with your competitors as well.
Jim Craigie: And Caroline you know there has been retail consolidation up there, some new competitors. It’s just a very volatile market. We are showing some improvement in beginning the Q4. So, we’re optimistic there. It’s just something we’ve been dealing with the environment up there. I think everybody has been dealing with it. And I think again, we had a good month of October overall especially in Canada.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: That’s good. And on (inaudible)
Matt Farrell: What’s the second one, Caroline?
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Just you made these acquisitions in (inaudible) I’m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that market and whether you see other opportunities to expand there.
Matt Farrell: Oh, you mean in the women’s health?
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Yes, with your acquisition.
Matt Farrell: Look, our women’s health business in the U.S. is essentially a pregnancy kit business. We still have an opportunity using our gummies to expand the first response into another area. This is complementary because we’re already in the business in Europe. So, it’s not -- we’re not strangers to this particular category. These are small categories, but growing. So, I wouldn’t say that we were going to go on a roll up here with respect to women’s vaginal products. It is a subsection of lubricants. Lubricants is not growing as a total category, but the subcategories within those are growing far more rapidly and that was what the attraction was for us of each of these brands.
Caroline Levy - CLSA:  Thank you. And finally just on vitamins, you said the categories come back to 1% growth. Do you -- from past experience where the categories had that pressed, does it then resume within sort of 6 to 12 months? Do you think you will be back to that mid single-digit?
Matt Farrell: Yes. Usually it does, Caroline. It’s something when we bought this business to be flatter and the category goes up and down based on news in the marketplace. So, we were told about that and that’s exactly what we’re seeing right now. I can’t predict exactly what number we’ll go to, but it’s definitely had a vacuum in the positive direction now.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Jim Craigie: Hello? Good morning.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets: Hey, sorry about that. I was on mute.
Jim Craigie: Okay.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, good morning. Congrats Matt. Two questions from my side. Jim, general environment, I guess as we’ve been hearing other companies reporting you’ve indicated that U.S. has kind of improved and I know you’ve had a pretty good handle on the economy going back several years. So, I want to just get your updated thoughts on the State of the Union here in the U.S.? And then the second question is on the vitamin business and I know one of the big initiatives you’ve had with sampling. And I am just curious as now maybe you have some statistics around conversion, around the sampling efforts? Thanks.
Jim Craigie: Yes Nik. The economy -- all I can say if I can go back to what I repeated in my call, so the categories that we’re in, we’re seeing good steady improvement from minus 0.8 to plus or minus in the second quarter the plus 0.8 in the third quarter. I can’t predict it going forward. I mean you read the papers every day, someday it is headwind, someday it is tailwind on that. So, I am just -- maybe I’m snitch more optimistic right now, but as we continue going forward I will tell you there is every day I read the negative news I know if you haven’t seen it there is concerns about the Port of Long Beach in California, with two to three week delays on products coming into the country. Luckily we have very small part of our product line is imports, I don’t see any impact on that, but I feared impact on retailers being able to merchandise stuff in Q4. But overall, it’s just -- I think the categories we’re in again driven by innovation are starting to show some improvement. The BMS sampling is a key part of that program. We continue to spend more money on that. I don’t have any statistics to give you honestly. So, it’s good news, our business continues to grow; we continue to be number one share position and we’ve got a lot of new products in the pipeline come along. I think we often told we’re right now putting in a new capacity in the plant that will increase our capacity by about 75%. That new production lines will be up and running soon. So we have lots of very aggressive plans for vitamins going forward.
Matt Farrell: Great. And just one quick one on the acquisition announcement. Can you provide any context on maybe distribution gaps? I mean what is the real opportunity in terms of low hanging fruit with some of these brands?
Jim Craigie: No, I wouldn’t say that. Lil’ Drug Store is a really good operator and they had really good ACV for these. There are some of likes there, but I wouldn’t be looking at these brands as having big voids to sell.
Jim Craigie: I think Nik, we kind of -- Matt kind of alluded we have another business sort of like this called Femfresh over in Europe. It has products within this line which maybe applicable to this business. And with that we’d be launching additional products into these two brands.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Jason Gere - KeyBanc: Hey, thanks. Good morning and Matt, echoing the congratulations. Just actually most of the questions have been asked, just two kind of follow ups. One, I think Matt you mentioned about operating margin up 50 basis points, I just want to make sure that was for the full year, not for the fourth quarter. And I have a second question as a follow-up?
Matt Farrell: Yes, that’s full year, full year ‘15.
Jason Gere - KeyBanc: Okay, great. And then I guess the last question is just on the vitamin. In the third quarter, I think you said consumption to you guys was up high single-digit. Did you say what the shipment -- your actual shipment growth was as a part of that whole personal care?
Jim Craigie: No, we don’t do that. 
Matt Farrell: No, we don’t do that for any brand.
Jason Gere - KeyBanc: Okay. Is it in line with what personal care or is can you say a little bit higher or little bit lower?
Jim Craigie: We don’t do this for any brand. We always going to ask, but we don’t go into sales and margins by brand or SPU or any that.
Jason Gere - KeyBanc:  All right. Okay, I’ll leave it with that. Thanks a lot.
Matt Farrell: Thanks Jason.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America: Thank you. Thanks for fitting me in and Matt first congrats on your extended role. As far as my question, can we talk a little bit about the key drivers of the 3% organic sales growth for fiscal ‘15 because specialty obviously grew much faster this year? And then you mentioned earlier that’s you’re not going to see as many new products in 2015 and 2014. So perhaps can you talk a little bit about the spread between consumer versus specialty growth going forward? And perhaps some specifics on what’s going to drive consumer to help offset the difficult comps in specialty? Thanks so much.
Matt Farrell: Yes. I would say -- just to be clear. So, it’s not in the release and it’s not in the script. So we haven’t called the top-line for next year. So, we’re not ready to call any lines. I don’t think we really said is that we expect gross margin expansion and the reasons for that we’re going to be the fact that we had such a huge number of new products launch this year unlike the slotting and couponing to generate trial in ‘14 that we don’t expect to repeat as much next year. I gave an example with respect to the sustainability of the SG&A costs. And in my example I said that if you assumed 3% top-line growth then you kept the lead on SG&A at only 1% or less that you could generate 25 of your 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. But we’re not ready right now to be calling the three pieces; domestic, international and specialty products. But I will say that you’re right with respect to lightening striking twice, when you look at the kind of year that specialty products had this year, it’s certainly not obvious to us either that that will repeat next year.
Olivia Tong - Bank of America: Got it. Thank you.
Jim Craigie: Okay. Hey I want to thank everybody for taking the time to meet with us this morning. Again, very proud of the results this quarter and just hope things keep going well, which I think they will. Again I said earlier, we had a good October and we’ve got a couple of months to go to finish the year. So, thanks again for taking the time. Bye, bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our second quarter business results, which you've read about in our press release morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and to discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the second quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued weak U.S. consumer demand and a highly competitive environment, the Church & Dwight team delivered solid business results in line with our 2014 plan. As you know, our 2014 plan is driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and best-in-class management of overhead costs and cash flow. As you've heard from many of our CPG competitors, consumer demand is very weak. We are facing the same tough business environment, as consumption was flat or down in 8 of our 13 categories. While we have taken actions to remain price competitive, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in the long term. Despite the tough business environment, our goal in 2014 is to not only deliver our aggressive business targets, but to drive share growth across all of our major categories via innovative new products. Innovation has been the key to our past success, as shown by the fact that over 32% of our sales in 2013 came from new products launched since 2007. As promised, we launched a record number of innovative new products in 2014 across every one of our major categories and 3 new categories. This represents the first time in our company's history that we launched a great new product in every one of our major categories in the same year and the first time that we launched into more than one new category in 1 year. In the first quarter of 2014, our sales force did an incredible job in gaining incremental distribution from retailers in every category. Gaining incremental distribution is the first key step to driving future sales and profit growth. So we got off to a great start. In the second quarter, our goal was to initiate strong consumer demand for the new products via increased marketing support. We also met this goal, as we achieved record quarterly share results on 3 of our 4 mega brands and share gains on 3 of our 5 other major brands. These 9 brands represent over 80% of our sales and profit. While there's still a half-year to go, we are right on track to deliver our aggressive EPS target of 7% to 9% growth despite the difficult headwinds, which are driving many of our competitors to forecast lower earnings growth. I'll now turn the call over to Matt, to give you some specific details on our second quarter business results.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. Second quarter EPS was $0.65 per share. That compares with $0.61 in 2013, so up 7% from 1 year ago. And of course, the $0.65 was better than our $0.61 outlook. With respect to FX, netted in our $0.65 is a $0.01 drag from FX year-over-year. Reported revenues were up 2.6% to $808 million. Organic sales of 3% was in line with our Q2 outlook of 3% organic sales. Of the 3% organic growth, approximately 3.6% was due to volume with 60 basis points of negative product mix and pricing. Price mix was less of a story in Q2 versus Q1. Remember in Q1, we had a high level of sliding to drive distribution of our new products, and that was less so in the second quarter. Now let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic's business' organic sales increased by 0.7%, primarily due to sales of our recently introduced ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL Cat Litter, OxiClean Liquid Laundry Detergent and higher sales of ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent and Vitafusion vitamins. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of XTRA laundry detergent and lower sales of ARM & HAMMER unit dose laundry detergent. The volume growth contributed approximately 1.5% to organic sales, offset by 80 basis points negative affect of product mix and price. The volume growth deceleration in Q2 was, in large part, due to slower share growth of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry, which was 0.2% in the quarter, and share declines on the XTRA brand. So the consumer business wasn't as strong as we expected in the quarter. However, the actions we took starting in June resulted in a strong end to the quarter and an even better July. So for example, for the 4 weeks ended July 19, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry share is up 0.8 points year-over-year. And we expect the consumer business to be stronger in Q3 than in Q2 as our actions drive stronger volumes. International business is next. The organic growth was up 3.9%. Volume increased approximately 4.7%, offset by 80 basis points of unfavorable product mix and pricing. We had strong growth across all the countries within that division. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales increased by 22.9%. The animal nutrition business drove a 20.9% volume increase, with favorable mix and pricing contributing another 2%. Remember that last year, Q2 2013 was a very difficult quarter for this business. And currently, the U.S. dairy industry is extremely healthy, experiencing record high milk prices and low input costs, which are driving demand for our product. So we expect, on a full year basis, total company organic sales to be approximately 3%. I'm now going to discuss gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 44.6%, a 50 basis points contraction year-over-year, but better than the 100 basis points contraction we expected. The decrease in gross margin year-over-year is primarily due to increased coupon redemptions, trade spending and higher commodity costs, offset by positive product and business mix, and of course, our productivity programs. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to contract 75 basis points, which is at the high end of our previous 50 to 75 basis points range that we discussed in May. And this is largely due to the price competition in the laundry category. Regarding commodities, our year-over-year input costs have trended up in Q2, in particular due to resin, which is at a 3-year high. Next is marketing. The marketing spend for the second quarter was $113.4 million or 14% of revenues, which is an 80 basis point increase over the prior year spend and $10 million higher on a dollar spend. If you are a historian, it's been 5 years since marketing, as a percentage of sales, has hit 14% or higher in the second quarter. And our marketing spend, of course, was timed to support new products, and we reached record shares on 3 of our 4 mega brands in the quarter. We expected our marketing spend to be front end loaded this year to support all the great new products during launch. The second half is expected to be lower versus 1 year ago. But of course, you've always heard us talk about share of voice versus share of market. Now looking at that ratio, we're very satisfied. Also, a flat marketing spend for the year is relatively stronger than quite a bit of our peers, who are cutting marketing to fund trade program -- programs. And this is also evident in some of the news you've probably been watching, with respect to the upfront buys, which has been weaker this year. SG&A is next. SG&A year-over-year was lower by $2 million in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13%, a 60 basis point decrease from the prior year second quarter. So, so far, in the first half, we've averaged 110 basis points decrease versus the prior year, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half and for the year. Next is operating profit. Reported operating margin for the quarter was 17.1%, which was a 70 basis point contraction versus year ago. But keep in mind, this is largely due to the 80 basis point increase in marketing year-over-year. With respect to income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter is 34.2%, slightly less than last year, which was 34.5%. And we expect the full year rate to be 34%. With respect to cash flow, we generated $207 million of net cash from operations for the first half of 2014 and we invested $17 million year-to-date in CapEx. So we now expect to spend approximately $70 million on CapEx for full year 2014. Cash from operations full year is expected to exceed $525 million and free cash flow to exceed $455 million. Regarding stock buybacks. The company has purchased $435 million of shares through ASRs year-to-date, $260 million in Q1 and $175 million in Q2. You may recall that during our May call, I said that we would likely spend more and about half of the remaining authorization. And that's what we did. We have approximately $140 million remaining under our authorization, and we do not anticipate making additional share repurchases in 2014. So I'm going to wrap it up now. So looking ahead, we feel good about the second half. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.80 to $0.82 compared to $0.76 per share last year. And as we mentioned in the release, we expect 3% organic sales growth in Q3 and gross margin to contract by 150 basis points. We began 2014 expecting a back-end loaded year. Q1 EPS was down 4%, as it was a big investment quarter behind new products. Q2 that we just ended, up 7% EPS despite a significant increase in marketing. And in Q3, using the midpoint of our $0.80 to $0.82 range that I just mentioned is also up 7%. So that implies Q4 would deliver $0.19 of earnings improvement year-over-year, if you want it to reach the midpoint of our 7% to 9% range. So almost half of the Q4 earnings improvement will come from 3 things: an impairment charge that you read about in last year's 10-K, that we don't expect to repeat; we have some litigation costs in the prior year quarter that we also don't expect to repeat; and of course, lower shares. The balance of the year-over-year EPS increase in Q4, about 10% growth, comes from the base business and greater traction from new products that we launched earlier in the year. So to summarize the full year, for those of you who are working on your models, we're expecting 3% organic sales; gross margin contraction of 75 basis points, obviously influenced by slotting and couponing, behind the new products; and if you work your way down the P&L, we expect marketing as a percentage of sales to be flat year-over-year, to be around 12.5%, and now expect SG&A to be down 125 basis points. And all that would get us to the midpoint of the 7% to 9% EPS range, and the 50 basis points expansion of operating margin. Back to you, Jim.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I'll finish off our portion of the call today by adding a little color to the second quarter results that Matt just took you through, and then provide my outlook on the year. As I mentioned earlier, our new product innovations played a key role in driving share gains in the second quarter across 6 of our 9 biggest brands, including share gains on 3 of our 4 mega brands. Among those 9 brands, our biggest focus was on turning the OxiClean brand into a mega brand in 2014, by extending it into 3 new categories: premium laundry detergent; bleach alternatives and automatic dishwashing detergents. Overall, this strategy is off to a great start, as assumption of the total OxiClean brand in the second quarter was up 35% versus year ago. This included strong results on every form of the brand. The core OxiClean laundry additive product achieved a record quarterly share of 45.5%, which is bigger than the next 4 competitors combined. The new OxiClean premium laundry detergent achieved a 1.0 dollar share in the liquid laundry detergent category, after just 4 months in distribution. A 1.0 dollar share may not seem much to you, but keep in mind that the liquid laundry detergent category is a $6 billion category, and P&G's famous Cheer brand is only a 1.0 share after 768 months in market. And most importantly, our consumer research reveals that the sale of our new OxiClean premium liquid laundry detergent brand is over 80% incremental to our other liquid laundry detergents. Our new OxiClean auto dish detergent achieved a 1.6% dollar share in the second quarter, is on track to become the #3 player in this category by year end. And our new OxiClean bleach alternative, called White Revive, achieved a 2.2% dollar share in the second quarter. Distribution of this product was almost entirely incremental, as we were able to get it placed in the bleach section versus the laundry detergent section, where the core OxiClean laundry additive product is located. As a result, sales of this product are over 70% incremental to the core OxiClean laundry additive franchise. The strong sales incrementality of these new products is critical to achieving sales growth. Our other mega brands also achieved strong results in the second quarter. Our newest mega brand, the Avid gummy vitamin business, delivered double-digit consumption growth in the second quarter, behind expanded distribution, new products and increased marketing support. This double-digit growth occurred just by flat category growth, as a result of unfavorable publicity last year about the benefits of taking multivitamins. The category trends are now headed in the positive direction and most importantly, the fast-growing gummy form of vitamins now represents 7% of the total vitamin category. That's more than twice what it was when we bought the business in 2012. This still leaves over 93% of the $7 billion vitamin category to be conquered by encouraging consumers to switch from the swallowing tasteless hard pills to enjoying our delicious tasting gummy vitamins. We have the #1 gummy brand for both kids and adults, and Church & Dwight was 1 of only 2 vitamin brands to grow share in the second quarter. These strong results to date put us on track to deliver our double-digit sales growth outlook of the year, despite lower-than-expected category growth and increased gummy competition. On our TROJAN mega brand, we achieved a record quarterly share in the sexual health category, driven by record quarterly sales of condoms and continued growth of our new lubricant line that was launched in 2013. On the largest part of our sexual health business, our TROJAN condom business, we matched its highest ever quarterly market share at 76.0%. And this momentum has continued in the third quarter, as I just learned yesterday that the TROJAN condom business achieved an all-time record monthly share of 76.8% in the month of July. Our biggest mega brand, ARM & HAMMER, held its share in the second quarter, despite some fierce price competition. In the laundry category, the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent brand grew its share. This share growth represented the 18th consecutive quarter that the ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent brand has posted year-on-year share growth. It strengthened the brand's #1 position in the value segment and it enabled the ARM & HAMMER brand to pass the ALL brand to become the #3 brand in the total liquid laundry detergent category. While these are very positive results to the ARM & HAMMER brand, the real star of the ARM & HAMMER mega brand portfolio was our cat litter business. Our premium price cat litter, called ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal, has been a huge hit with the consumers, as reflected in both our brand share results and its positive impact on category growth. Our second quarter consumption for our ARM & HAMMER cat litter business increased by over 20%, and our share grew 2.8 points to a record quarterly share of 23.3%. These great share results strengthen our position as the number 2 brand in the category. Just as important, our new Clump & Seal product has been a major contributor to driving cat litter category sales growth of over 7% in the second quarter, the strongest growth in any of our 13 categories and excellent growth for any CPG category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. Unfortunately, some of our competitors have not invested in developing new products and instead, have increased their trade and coupon spending to defend their brands. This happened particularly in the laundry detergent category. In case you do not know, Church & Dwight is the only competitor to grow share in the laundry detergent category every year for the past 5 years. We are now the #2 player in this category, and 1 out of every 4 wash loads is done with a Church & Dwight laundry detergent. The growth of our laundry detergent business has been driven by our value pricing, great new products, increased distribution and higher marketing spending. As I stated earlier, our largest laundry detergent brand, ARM & HAMMER, has posted year-on-year share growth for 18 consecutive quarters, including share growth in the first and second quarters of 2014. Our OxiClean laundry additives brand has posted year-on-year share growth for 11 consecutive quarters and achieved a record quarterly share of 45.5% in the second quarter. In 2014, we launched innovative new products on our ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent brand. And to continue our remarkable record of share growth, we extended the OxiClean brand into the laundry detergent category, with solid initial results, as I mentioned earlier. Unfortunately, several competitors who have not invested in innovative new products began lowering their prices starting the third quarter of 2013. We held off from responding in the back half of 2013 because our laundry brands continue to deliver sales and share growth driven by our product innovations. In the first quarter of 2014, the competitors added unprecedented levels of coupon support on top of the lower price points. Again, we held our ground, in the hopes that our new product innovations, which are being launched at the end of the first quarter, would offset these pricing actions. The competitors kept up their higher trade spending and coupon support in the second quarter, and it began to clearly impact the sales of our laundry brands despite the launch of our new products. So starting in the month of June, we took actions designed to restore our price competitiveness and drive increased trial behind our great new laundry detergent products. I will not divulge or answer any questions concerning the specifics of what we have done, for competitive reasons. I will just tell you that these actions drove a significant improvement in our sales and our share results starting in June and we've seen continued sales and share momentum in July. In fact, our laundry detergent business achieved a record high share in the month of July. So I'm confident that our actions should enable us to deliver the laundry and business results that we need to deliver our 2014 annual sales and EPS commitments. I'll finish off our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the year. As I stated in the press release, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance of organic sales growth of approximately 3% and earnings growth target of 7% to 9%. This will be driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products across every one of our major categories and 3 new categories, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs. Our 7% to 9% earnings growth target is in the upper quartile of EPS growth target ranges in the CPG industry, consistent with our historical performance. And we believe that we can deliver that within that aggressive range despite the highly environment and weak U.S. consumer demand. The majority of our annual earnings growth is planned to occur in the second half, since the first half includes a significant increase in slotting, couponing, trade promotions and incremental advertising support for our new product launches versus what we spent last year. In conclusion, 2014 is shaping up to be another very challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your bets on the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver consistently strong EPS growth. Last, but not least, I want to assure that we are pursuing acquisitions, and we have over $2 billion of financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective about the types of businesses we acquire. At the same time, we're also responsible to our shareholders so we will continue to be patient until we find the right deal that will pay dividend for many years to come. That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Two questions. First on the SG&A efficiency. It's certainly driving a fair amount of growth this year. The question is sustainability of that. How much of the SG&A cuts are sort of transitory, whether they be incentive compensation, et cetera, that may need to be reloaded next year versus how much of it is enduring?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, Jason, it's too early to comment on incentive compensation, as far as saying how much of a benefit there may or may not be year-over-year. It's a whole function of our 4 metrics for the full year.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you comment on how much of this maybe enduring?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Are you saying that next year, if we have a blowout year, will incentive comp be higher? Yes, it will be.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: No, not incentive comp, just the rest of SG&A. I mean, you're -- it's tracking down year-on-year. Should we expect -- if we were to forget about incentive compensation just the underlying components, does it bounce is back? I know you mentioned, the first quarter, you are lapping some acquisition-related expenditures, which presumably they've gone away unless there's another deal, they're not going to come back...
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Right, exactly. That's right, yes. On the first quarter, SG&A was down 160 basis points, 40 basis points came from the fact that we didn't have the average transition costs year-over-year, right? So they're not going to be reloaded next year.
James R. Craigie: But Jason, we've done a lot in terms of IT systems to be able to keep overhead down. And we look at some organizational design things. So I would tell you the vast majority of SG&A savings is enduring.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, Jason, what -- the way the model works for us is that SG&A needs to grow at a much slower rate than our top line growth rate. That way, we're going to get leverage on that line. And that, combined with acquisitions, has enabled us to drive that number down 300 basis points over a number of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess, can you guys just maybe expand a little bit further on what you saw in laundry during the course of Q2 and how it differed from your expectations coming in to the quarter? And then as you look forward over the course of Q3 and Q4, I guess, a little more details on what you expect to -- what kinds of sensitivities you had around competitive dynamics, retail responses over the balance -- on the balance of the year in that specific category?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Steve, I mean, I can't speak for competition. I can just tell you about what happened is, as I said, we didn't start it. We don't like it. We prefer to grow through innovation. We've taken appropriate actions to deal with it. And I'm confident we'll deliver our 2014 EPS commitments despite it and exit the year with momentum.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. On -- as you -- I guess, as you think about -- this is shifting gears kind of entirely, but if you think about your M&A activity, can you talk about where you're just seeing the most flow of potential deals, setting aside the quality of those opportunities? I guess, are there certain categories where there's more flow, whether personal care, household or consumer health? Are the opportunities skewed to smaller standalone companies or...
James R. Craigie: Steve, let me save you a minute, the answer is no.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: You're not going to do it? Okay, fine. And then I guess, lastly, on mega brand growth, looking into the out years. From here, how much do you expect, roughly, growth to be driven by your base products -- base category presences today versus further horizontal expansion and into new adjacencies? Just kind of give us a rough feel of the balance that you have as a base case?
James R. Craigie: Yes, it's a great question, Steve. Honestly, we don't have a spine of measure on that because we launch new products in the base, as well as launching into the new categories. The real key there is the efficiency of marketing spending. We just saw in OxiClean this year because we launched into 3 new categories, plus we had innovation on the base. The whole businesses is up 35%, if you count all the sales against it. And it's just an efficient way to go-to-market because if we spend money on OxiClean laundry detergent or OxiClean dishwashing, it halos to the whole business. So at this point in time, I can't honestly give you an answer to the fact that the difference between the new categories versus the base because it really depends on what we do in each of those categories going forward in that. But it's just -- the core is that we -- the 4 mega brands we have right now are about 60% of our revenues. And we're spending about 75% of our marketing money against those 4 because you get the biggest bang for the buck. So you're going to see that overall, the 4 mega brands are going to be the biggest drivers of our future growth. I just can't tell you within the categories they cover what that will be.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Is it just fair to say though that your R&D focus is spread -- is balanced between extension of the core versus exploration of new categories?
James R. Craigie: Absolutely. Because the core -- still, the vast majority of those business is still the core.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to get your thoughts -- I mean, you've been kind of ahead of the curve and very accurate on your assessment of just generally what's been going on in the U.S. economy. And it just seems like the second quarter things really took a turn for the worse. And I'm just wondering your thoughts, are you seeing something in terms of trips, because all center store items are really starting to suffer. So I'm wondering if this reduced trip levels are impacting consumption? Just any perspective you might have on what could explain the step down from where we were even 3 and 6 months ago?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Nik. I wish I knew more. I mean, all I can tell you top line, as I said, 8 of our 13 categories were flat or down in the second quarter. That's all -- it's honestly only a little worse than it's been in prior years. It's not like a major falling off the cliff. I don't have anything specific, I have no personal thoughts. It's just the people just have less disposable income out there and they're having to make hard choices and having to stretch their product uses over time in that. And I just don't -- I don't see any improvement -- we're not counting on any improvement going forward. That's why it's very important to us to put out products that offer a great product, but also great value. And that's what we're particularly known at -- known for. But I wish things are going to get better. I don't believe the headlines in USA Today talking about things looking brighter out there. We're going to continue to operate on. We're plan for the worst and hope for the best.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then the -- last question, is just on the July figures that you provided in the laundry category. Have you seen any response from the competition in that regard? I mean, should we just expect them to kind of stay where they are? Or have you seen some response?
James R. Craigie: Well, I will say Procter has stepped up the game out there, in terms of trading coupon support. I mean, just walk into a Walmart and look at their displays on that. So Procter has absolutely stepped up support. Good news is the category actually showed some improvement because I think between us and Procter, stepping up support, people are trading back up to the better brands, and it'd be a better ring in the store. So despite the increased intensity out there, particularly from us and Procter, categories starting to move in a positive direction.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Matt, I want -- I thought your commentary that you don't plan on buying back any further shares for the balance of the year was curious, given your cash position. Can you reconcile that a bit for us, particularly given the pullback in the stock and near-term M&A intentions?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, I wouldn't comment on what our prospects are or events that might take place in M&A in the short term. Now we've -- this company has always been thoughtful about how it deploys its cash. So we don't necessarily go and take every dime and plow it into share purchases in order to get an EPS benefit. Many have been in the camp of saying that the company is underlevered. And that is a great ability to buy back shares to reduce -- or to increase EPS. But of course, we think the highest and best use of the balance sheet is acquisition. So this is something we visit every quarter as management and as a board and concluded that where we are, we're pretty happy with what we've done year-to-date. Obviously, it supports our ability to hit our 7% to 9% EPS growth number. So consequently, we're done for the year.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And Jim, can you, I guess, give us a little bit more detail -- this is with respect to unit dose, and specifically what impediments you guys are facing there? Because we're what, low double-digits, I think, is a percent of the category now for unit dose as a percent of laundry, and likely moving higher. And you guys really aren't participating in a meaningful way. So what are the impediments that you guys are facing? And do you plan on participating in a more meaningful way?
James R. Craigie: Well, Kevin, I mean, unit dose is a great product, great innovation. Kudos to Procter that innovation is driving the category. We have participated. We had a product out there before Procter got out there. They've obviously been putting a lot of their marketing support behind it. We decided to focus more in the liquid business, which is over 70% of the category. So we're out there. We've got a great product out there. We have more innovations coming along that product line. So the -- it's now about 11% to 12% of the total laundry business. So like, again, we look at priorities and we put more of our energy behind the liquid side of the business, 70%, and we put a lot of energy behind launching OxiClean liquid laundry detergent. We also launched that, by the way, in a pod form. But the liquids remains the key focus right now. But I totally applaud Procter on the unit dose product. Great new product. They're there. They have gotten higher than their fair share because they put the majority of their support behind it. But we're going to -- we're there and we're going to be there, and we hope to grow that business in the future.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just one more for me, if I may. Jim, this is for you. Just with respect to the 3% to 4%, and this is long-term algorithm, and I'm not asking you guys to guide for next year. But it seems -- last year, you fell a little bit short. This year, you'll be stretching probably to get to the lower end and you have specialty and cat litter and a big contribution from Avid, which are driving most of it. In the absence of buying an asset that's accretive to your growth, does the long-term algorithm feel like it's more of a stretch in this environment?
James R. Craigie: No, not at all. I mean, honestly I always want you guys -- well, think -- 2014 is really a year of investing for the future for us. But still, unlike other companies, they'd say invest, and they pull down their EPS. We're going to invest and still deliver a top quartile EPS growth. Don't forget we put a lot of energy and a lot of cost into launching the record number of new products this year across all of our 9 brands. We've spent the marketing support behind it. So we expect that to pay off in the future. There's a lot investment there. And then, we have the pricing situation breakout in the laundry category. That has partly dented at this year. I can't project what the future of that will be, but I don't believe that's going to continue forever. So I definitely feel the investment we made in new products this year -- the marketing -- we held our marketing. Other guys are cutting their marketing. That's going to pay off. And so at the end of the day, you guys always pay us to find the levers to drive the bottom line earnings growth. We have the revenue levers one, we got gross margin, we got marketing, we got SG&A, we got cash flow, we got acquisitions. And you pay us to figure out what combination of those delivers in our top quartile growth. And we've always found a way to do that. We've quadrupled our share over the 10 years. Nobody gave us a pass last year, when our Specialty Products division tanked, but we covered that and still delivered double the EPS growth. And this year, we're having a little bit of problem with the domestic side, with the pricing of laundry. But we're taking care of that and going forward. So just trust us, that we'll always going to find a way to deliver top quartile EPS growth. We've done it in the past. We're going to do it in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen from William Blair.
Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to ask about your newest mega brand, Avid. You mentioned, Jim, double-digit consumption growth and a flat category. Can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that? And where you stand in terms of distribution expansion on the base business? And then kind of where you are in terms of ACV and the new enhanced offerings? And then you also said that you have seen some improvement in the underlying category. What are you seeing there? And what's driving that?
James R. Craigie: Yes. I think -- it was late last year, a report came out that kind of dinged the benefits from taking multivitamins. And it actually drove a category that have consistently grown high-single-digits or low-double-digits, set it back and it actually declined for a quarter or 2. Now it's coming back. Second quarter was flat. We expect the category to start growing again in the third and fourth quarter. So we heard this -- we talked to many people in the vitamin business where we bought this business. And they expect -- they said to expect these things to happen as reports come out, as they do in many, many food categories in there. So that was unfortunate, but it wasn't a surprise and it doesn't worry us at that all. And like I said, it's gone from being negative in the first quarter to neutral in the second quarter, and we see every sign it will go positive in third and fourth quarters. Distribution, we've gained a lot since we bought this business because, quite honestly, we have a much bigger sales force than the prior owner did. And our sales is doing a job in getting distribution of the current products out there. We still have room to grow on that in, and we're still cracking distribution voids every day. And I don't have an exact number on the ACV, but it's -- we're -- we still have many opportunities. Just clarify too, the real growth opportunity is in adult vitamins. We bought a business that already -- in the kids side of the business, over 50% of the category was already gummies. So we love to grow that even more, but it was already high. When we bought the business, the adult side was only about 3% of the total adult business. Now the great news is the adult business is about $6.5 billion category, versus kids, it's like $300 million. So that's actually great. So with $6.5 billion, only 3% is adult gummies. That's already more than double that. But still, over 90% of the adult vitamins to capture as we trade people up. And I have yet to find 1 person, 1 adult who I've got to try the gummy vitamins who isn't blown away by how great it tastes and wants to convert right away. And we're just doing a great job of launching all sorts of new vitamins, and there's lots of opportunities for new types of vitamins going forward that our team is working hard on. So if I sound excited about this business, I am. This is one that's going to be -- it's going to -- it's already a great acquisition for us, and it's got such massive potential going forward, that we just salivate at looking at the opportunities on the vitamin business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello from Oppenheimer.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I just want to start out with the share buyback discussion. Because if you look at 2Q, I guess, your stock was somewhere between $68 and $70. And you bought back $175 million, like you said you would. And with stock here at 64 and change, I was curious what your thought process is to buying back more stock. Why stop at $435 million? Why not, given the pullback, be more aggressive here?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, Joe, this is Matt. So we're -- we don't conduct ourselves as opportunistic buyers as moving in and out of the market depending on what the share price is. We're more deliberate about if we want to deploy a certain amount of cash and buy back shares and that's why we avail ourselves on accelerated stock repurchase, which as you know, once you make a decision, you get 90% of the shares upfront and you're done. So it's -- we don't look at it as we're running a trading desk. And as I said, we're far more interested in deploying the cash for acquisitions. That's the highest and best use of the capital.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. So since you're not buying back anymore stock, should we read into that in terms of the health of the M&A market?
James R. Craigie: Joe -- your weight still down, Joe?
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Yes, yes it is.
James R. Craigie: Go out for a run please.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: All right, last question for you. The guidance for this year, Matt, you did a good job of explaining the drivers in 4Q on the bottom line. But if you look at the top line, the organic growth number for 4Q, if you do 3% in the third quarter is going to be somewhere north of 4. So can you help us understand why you're going to see that step up in the fourth quarter on the organic growth side?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, as far as the fourth quarter goes, as we move through the year, there's less and less slotting, less and less couponing to simulate trial. The trial is -- pardon me, coupons are netted in the net sales number. And we're expecting the traction of our new products to really accelerate, as we move from the Q3 into Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just following up on a previous question. Jim, you guys have had a really good history of delivering on EPS goals. But when all your competitors are spending more, macros are worse and your peers are targeting lower outlooks, as you mentioned. Why is 7% to 9% still the right target range? And are you leaving yourself enough flexibility to respond in case -- in case stuff happens?
James R. Craigie: Well, I'll first answer that because we're better managers in business than they are. But stepping beyond that, no, I would -- hey, look, if I felt we couldn't get there in a quality way, I would lower my call. But I feel we can get there in a quality way. Again, Matt mentioned earlier, our marketing spending is going to be flat on the year. I think that's going to be better than other folks. We already saw the upfront buy in the TV industry, announcement that some of our major players have cut back on their TV spending going forward next year. We're, at least, keeping it flat. So again, we look at share of voice, which is how much of the advertising spending in the category you have, and we see us as having at least this -- our fair share or more to help grow our shares. And second quarter was great. I think for those -- so rest of the year, I feel pretty confident that we're well-positioned on a marketing spending base to drive our brand. If I didn't, I would think about cutting back the EPS. But I really feel the combination of our programs, our new products and everything will deliver our numbers. The June, July numbers were extremely encouraging to us. We banged record shares on 3 of our 4 mega brands in Q2. July is off to a great start. So I really feel good at this point. But it isn't like we just hold to a number, but I always wanted to do it in a quality way. And I think right now, we'll deliver those results with 7% to 9% earnings growth and exit the year with momentum. I've never wanted -- we've had consistent growth. I will never over-deliver a year and then put the next year at risk. So I always want year-to-year-to-year growth. We've had that. We've had 10 great years. I mean, you should know it pained me to not do a double-digit earnings EPS growth this year. I've had 10 straight years of running this company with double-digit EPS growth. So I had a cathartic experience only calling 7% to 9% growth. So already in Jim Craigie's world, I pulled down the call from the past 10 years of history, but I still feel we can do that result, which is better than almost all my competitors, do it in a quality way and exit the year with momentum.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then just following up on the top line. Matt, you mentioned that couponing should decline as the year progresses, traction of new products should accelerate. So is this just a function of the fact that the comps are really particularly easy in the back half with price mix down pretty dramatically in the second half of '13? Or what -- I guess what gives you confidence that the couponing is going to decelerate as the year progresses? Or in the -- by Q4?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, the couponing -- remember, we have so many new products that are launching this year. And with new products, you're going to use coupons to simulate trial. You want people to try your new products. So once you start getting a trial and get repeat purchases, the coupons are going to start peeling back. That's why, as you move through the year, we're expecting we're going to have less in the fourth quarter, certainly in the third and then the second. And so kind of -- and we expect volumes to be better, as we move through the year for the consumer. They got -- we're better in Q2 than Q1, Q3 would be better than Q2, et cetera.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So even with competition getting quite a bit more difficult, you still feel pretty confident about your ability to accelerate the volume expansion in the back half of this year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. As Jim said, we think the combination of the media spend and the trade programs that we have in place are going to drive the volumes in the second half.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: My question is really a follow-up to a couple of the others and including that one. I think to get to your guidance of gross margins being down 75 basis points for the year, they have to be down a lot less than the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So I mean, you've now guided to gross margins down 150 basis points in the third quarter. Why don't you have to keep up the pressure on gross margins? You just explained less slotting. But there's other promotions that hurt gross margins. Why does that 150 basis point gross margin hit in the third quarter not have to be the same in the fourth quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, a part of it is going to be mix year-over-year, Alice. So it's product mix and business mix. The Specialty Products business continues to perform year-over-year. And their gross margin have been up quite a bit. Actually, in the second quarter and year-over-year, we can expect that to continue as we get into the fourth quarter. And volumes drive a lot of variable margin, right? So if you have high variable margin on your volumes, it's going to have a -- variable margins are, of course, are higher than your gross margins is going to influence the fourth quarter. And again, as I said before, the trial couponing is -- are also part of the gross margin drag, and there'll be less of that in the fourth quarter.
James R. Craigie: Alice, to Matt's point, we have some businesses like Nair that are very seasonal in the summer. And there's quite a bit of spending behind them. They're very off-season in the fourth quarter.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Also true for SpinBrush, is also seasonal...
James R. Craigie: SpinBrush -- and conversely, we have very high margin businesses like TROJAN, which is -- has a big fourth quarter around the holidays and that. So it is a good case of product mix helping to drive that with some higher-margin products having a very strong -- traditionally strong fourth quarter and some of the higher trade businesses don't.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And here you have this huge hike in marketing in the second quarter and yet your sales are disappointing. So I mean, you don't think the category is becoming commoditized more than before?
James R. Craigie: No, I think -- Alice, again, we would've had a much stronger organic growth in the second quarter if we had addressed the trade issue earlier. Because once we then have the marketing and we took care of the trade issue on the laundry business, month of June was excellent and now month of July is even better. So I think you've got to understand that the marketing spending was worthwhile in creating awareness out there. And most of our other businesses was fine. The laundry business dragged us down a little bit in Q2 in the first 2 months because we had the pricing issues on the laundry business, which we fixed starting in June.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Going back to the laundry side. Can you maybe help us understand what's going on with XTRA? Because I guess it seems like most of the price wars have been kind of the mid-tier and even with simply coming down to the mid-tiers? And I would think that XTRA is so far down on the price chain that it wouldn't be as affected. Are you seeing consumers kind of trade up with the other discounts? Or is there something else going on and is that continuing into this quarter?
James R. Craigie: No, Bill, I wish what you said was true. XTRA has been hurt the most of our 2 brands because we don't advertise it. And some of the competitors have been so aggressive on their pricing, one in particular has been doing buy 1 get 2 frees, that it actually had more impact on XTRA than it had on ARM & HAMMER. So it's been just mainly the dealing with the fact that some of the competition at the lower end has -- XTRA doesn't have as many protections to it that the ARM & HAMMER brand does. There's more advertising, more new product news on ARM & HAMMER. And XTRA took some of the brunt. But we've taken actions to fix that. And I think you'll see improvement in XTRA results in the back half of the year.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then switching to gross margin. Would -- I mean, if you take out kind of the price war in liquid laundry, would you have seen gross margin improvement this year? And I guess I'm looking that in kind of the long-term algorithm of gross margin improvement every year and part of management's compensation, I mean do you -- are there plans in place or projects in place where we can get back on track assuming that the price war subsides at some point?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, Bill, when you think about new products, you -- there's so much couponing and slotting associated with that year-over-year so -- for trial, that, that depresses the gross margin of new products significantly. So that's -- in a year where you have lots of new products launches -- launching, you -- it's going to create pressure on gross margin. So what happens is, you get to next year, right? So now you're established, let's say OxiClean. So OxiClean is going into 3 new categories, right, high-end laundry detergent, dish and bleach. So next year, they're all established in those 3 categories, the slotting goes away, the couponing to stimulate trial peels off, and now the margins associated with those 3 products improved year-over-year.
James R. Craigie: Yes so Bill, we're always going a year of -- we're always going to launch a fair number of new products. 2014 was just an unprecedented number of new products. We will still have a great year of new products next year, but not what we have this year. So as Matt saying, the spending against those will peel back and that will really help the gross margin in 2015 versus 2014.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then last one for me. Matt, just, since I am not as up-to-speed as you are on the cattle industry, would you expect Specialty to be up double-digits this year in terms of the top line?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. And it's -- by the way, it's dairy, Bill, as opposed to cattle.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Sorry, well I thought it was all connected, but yes. On the dairy industry, would you expect -- I mean are we -- is 10% plus is at the right kind of number for this year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, it is because if you'll -- in the first half alone, we've been -- we're up double-digit. First quarter, we were up 12% and second quarter up 22%.
James R. Craigie: Bill, the farmers -- the milk farmers love it when they have a situation where there's high milk prices that are still high and commodity cost -- it looks like it's going to be a record corn crop this year in the U.S., which should drive prices down. So it's an ideal environment for the milk out there because the farmers are getting a great price for their products and the commodity -- the input costs going in the feed is going to be low.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: And Bill, this is with respect to the Specialty Products business, just to remind everybody, it's sort of feast or famine with Specialty Products. And as Jim said, the last 2 years, 2012 and 2013, it's been a drag on our organic sales growth. 2011, you go back a few years, actually was a help to our total company organic sales growth. So I know we have -- really would like it always to be tracking the same way as consumer. It doesn't. This year, it's a help. It's going to be double-digits top line.
James R. Craigie: Yes and the early outlook on milk prices for 2015 is still very good.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Guys, I wanted to go back to vitamins for a second. Look, 10% growth is 10% growth, right? But with the gummy category, I think you said doubling its share of total vitamins. Are you getting as much of that incremental gummy piece that's growing as you would like? And if not, why? Like what has to change, if anything?
James R. Craigie: Yes, good question Chris. I mean, there's definitely more gummy competition out there. We are getting what we expected to. Double-digit growth, I think, is fantastic. And actually, the competition to me is very good because some of the bigger brands like Centrum and One A Day have moved in to the category. But that's great to me because, again, it's just telling consumers that gummy vitamins are just as good as hard pills. It's verifying the category. And again, it's still -- gummies are still less than 10% of the adult side. So I'll be very happy to take my fair share going forward of the 90% of the over $6 billion category that isn't gummy yet. And now, when you got the biggest guys in the space telling everybody they're just as good, go buy them. And I will bring you in one day and I'll sit you side-by-side and have you taste them. And ours by far taste better than any of theirs because we own our own plant. We have some unique proprietary technology in doing that thing. So there's just an advantage for us. But yeah, we've got new competition, but I look at that as a plus because, again, the biggest names in the industry have now verified that gummy vitamins are great and just as good as hard pills. And I can't imagine anybody who would still want to take a hard pill after eating a gummy vitamin.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Two questions. I guess the first one, if we could talk about the personal care business outside of Avid. And I know some of the innovation sounds pretty strong. But if you strip out the Avid piece that grew, it looks like the sales were weaker there. So can you talk about the innovation? And I know you're talking about June and July being a little bit stronger. Can you talk about maybe some of the promotional spending there and the results you're seeing? Because I know you've kind of laid out laundry a little bit and the reacceleration that you've seen. But could you talk maybe about the personal care outside of Avid? That's the first question.
James R. Craigie: Yes, Jason. sure. No, it's actually a very good portfolio. I mean, I just got results in for the month of July and the Nair brand hit an all-time record high. I told you TROJAN brand is hitting all-time record highs out there. So it's very good. The one business, kits -- kits has got great -- the pregnancy kits has great innovations on it. We're the first guys to the 6 day. There's a little bit of price competition there that's caused us to deal with on that side. But no, overall, still we have a brand called Batiste, which is largely an international business that's just locking out there, it's doing fantastic. We're expanding that in other countries around the world. So overall, the personal care business has actually been quite strong for us, for the last couple of quarters out there. And actually, our toothpaste business is also very strong. We started a campaign this year with a great new product with Alison Sweeney from The Biggest Loser TV show. And actually I can show you statistics that we're the fastest-growing brand in the toothpaste category in the last -- or the first 6 months of this year based on our results. So I mean, again, we're small and percentage-wise, it's a number, but we're doing great. So I'm very happy with personal care. And again, I go back to what I said to Alice before, so if it wasn't for some pricing issues in the laundry business, which we've now fixed, our organic growth would've been stronger in Q2. But now we fixed that, so this portfolio is on the back half of the year, which makes us feel so confident about delivering the numbers that, again, that EPS number that most guys aren't even near calling, but we feel confident of doing it next to the New York momentum.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. So we should see those sales numbers as you report them, sequentially improve?
James R. Craigie: Especially -- yes, well, especially in the laundry category. And the other categories should stay strong.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, fine. And then I guess the last question, and I'm not sure if you were listening to the P&G call before yours...
James R. Craigie: Who?
Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, exactly. Well, it's interesting now because as they talk about focusing on the 70 or 80 core brands out there, obviously there's both an opportunity and a threat, I guess, to you guys a little bit more than before. The threat obviously, there's a greater focus on the laundry as one of the brands within that portfolio. And then the opportunity is, as you're looking at M&A, here's like a new kind of source for maybe you to tap into. So I was just wondering if I can get your initial reaction or thoughts without making your blood boil.
James R. Craigie: Yes -- no, I didn't hear their exact comments. I can just tell you, I have the highest respect for Procter & Gamble. And I do that because they do focus on driving their businesses through innovation, and I 100% agree with that. So I don't think P&G could be any more of a threat to us than they are today. They're already our biggest competitor in many categories. And -- but I like the way they compete, and I applaud that, and I want the competition to be the same way. As far as opportunity, hey, we always look at stuff. We bought the SpinBrush brand from them when they had to divest. It was a Gillette acquisition has been -- it's a great brand for us and we -- we always look at everything. So if there was something in their portfolio they were divesting that was of interest, we'd take a look. But again, it has to be a strong brand. We have to believe it's something we can grow going forward, and we'll have to see it. Again, I don't know what they're talking about exactly. I don't worry about them focusing more on their core business. I don't think they've had a lack of a focus on their core businesses. So I don't worry about increased threats from them because I always -- they're always #1 on my list when I think about who I need to worry about every day. And I'm sure -- I might be #20 on their list, but I think we're growing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: What do you think the hangover is from all this laundry activity? Because if you look at the Nielsen data, like the baseline sales are way down. So clearly people are just buying because it's cheap. So [indiscernible] consumer service and stuff, you see this massive amount of pantry loading as well. So I'm just wondering what you guys think about kind of what happens 6 months down the road when people have 47 years of laundry detergent in their pantry.
James R. Craigie: That would be bad news if that happened, Bill. I haven't seen any evidence of the pantry loading. In fact, as I said before, I just saw the month of July results come in and I was actually quite happy. I mean, the category is going back north again towards a positive direction. So despite the increased price competition out there, so that was good to me. I -- I'm not -- I hear the issue. I -- we think about it. I haven't seen it yet. And I hope the category sooner rather than later gets back to being driven by innovation. So we'll see, consumers are getting a great deal right now with laundry detergent. But we'll see going forward. I have not seen evidence of the pantry loading. We watch our inventory situation versus consumption very carefully, and it's not showing any evidence of people loading up at this point.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Good. Okay. And then is that going to change broadly across the industry to couponing? Because if I wanted to, I can go on the Internet right now and get a free bottle of the [indiscernible] detergent. I can get free Tide. I mean, I've never seen it like this, just the pace of some of the couponing activity, and I was always under the assumption that couponing is dead. And I know it's not great for brand equity over time. So how do you guys think about that and how long do you think it's going to last?
James R. Craigie: Yes, I tend to agree with you Bill. I mean, couponing has been up for a couple of years now. I mean, it's been up. We just -- I mean, we mentioned in laundry, it just seemed to pick up especially early this year from our -- some of our competitors in those category. I'm a big believer with you. We have a philosophy. We largely like to use couponing just for trial of new products and then not after that. However, we've seen our competitors now start to subsidize price, which to me -- if you put that on top of high trade deals, it's just ridiculous to us. But I can't control what they do. So we're making sure we're competitive out there. And I think some of them someday are going to study what's happening to them, and they're going to realize they are over-subsidizing consumers. And to your point, I think destroying brand equity when they start to get people thinking of only buying on deals. So again, I can only take care of Church & Dwight here, and we're being prudent on what we do to drive our business. And the results in the last 2 months, especially in laundry, are very encouraging to us.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got you. and then just lastly, is there any update on the whole next wave of compaction thing that Walmart has mandated for 2018, I guess?
James R. Craigie: Bill, I'll just say it's on the table for discussion. And beyond that, as far as timetables of what it is, I can't comment anymore at this point in time. Okay. Everybody, you've exhausted us. It's been a great morning. Very happy with our call today. I appreciate the time. I know you got a very busy day today between -- most of you are probably were on call with Procter this morning, you've got us, and there's like one other competitor following us here. So anyways, I'm thrilled with our second quarter results. Very optimistic about the back half of the year. And I just appreciate the time you took today. If you have any questions or follow-ups, please give us a call. We'll do our best to answer them. Otherwise, thank you very much. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecast. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to share our insights on the company's business results. I'll start up this call by providing you with my perspective on our first quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to discuss our earnings guidance for the year, and then we will open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the first quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from continued weak U.S. consumer demand and a highly competitive environment, the Church & Dwight team successfully executed the first phase of our innovation-driven strategies by gaining incremental retail distribution for all of our great new products. As I stated on our last earnings release and at the CAGNY conference, we believe that innovation is the key to delivering strong sales and earnings growth in any economic and competitive environment. Innovation has been a key driver of our past success, as shown by the fact that over 25% of our sales in 2013 came from products launched since 2007. As promised, we launched a record number of innovative new products in 2014, across every one of our major categories and 3 new categories. This represents the first time in our company's history that we launched a great new product in every one of our major categories in the same year and the first time that we launched [ph] into more than one new category in one year. Our sales force did an incredible job in gaining incremental distribution from retailers in every category. Gaining incremental distribution is the key first step for driving future sales and profit growth, so we are off to a great start. The second phase of our innovation-driven strategy is to drive consumer demand for the new products via the marketing program supporting their launch. This marketing support started at the very end of the first quarter on all but one of the new products, so it's too soon to judge the consumers' reactions on the new products. However, one of the new products, our new premium-priced cat litter called ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal began shipping in December of 2013 before the other new products. Therefore, marketing support for this new cat litter began in January before the other new products. This new cat litter has been a huge hit with our consumers, as reflected in both our brand's share results and its impact on category growth. Our consumption increased by 15% and our share grew by 1.3 percentage points to a record quarterly share of 18.5%, which enabled our brand to move from the #3 brand position to a strong #2 brand in the category. Just as important, our new product has been a major contributor to driving category sales up over 9%, the strongest growth in any of our categories and excellent growth for any consumer packaged goods category. This exemplifies our belief that innovation is the key anecdote for driving improved value creation for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. Overall, the first quarter results were excellent on the share front, with share growth on 3 of our 4 mega brands, namely OxiClean, TROJAN and vitamins, that we held share in the total ARM & HAMMER brand, driven by increased marketing support. Unfortunately, some of our competitors have not invested in developing new products and instead have increased their trade and coupon spending to defend their brands. This happened particularly in the laundry detergent category in the first quarter. Church & Dwight is the only competitor that has grown share in the laundry detergent category every year for the past 5 years. We are now the #2 player in the category, and 1 out of every 4 washloads is done with a Church & Dwight laundry detergent. The growth of our laundry detergent business has been driven by our value pricing, great new products, increased distribution and higher marketing spending. Our largest laundry detergent brand, ARM & HAMMER, has posted year-on-year share growth for 17 consecutive quarters, including share growth from the first quarter of 2014. Our OxiClean laundry additives brand has posted year-on-year share growth for 10 consecutive quarters and achieved a record quarterly share of 45.1% in the first quarter, which is bigger than the next 4 laundry additive brands combined. In the first quarter of 2014, we launched innovative new products on our ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent brand, and to continue to support our remarkable record of share growth, we extended the OxiClean brand into the laundry detergent category and gained excellent incremental distribution by the end of the quarter. Several competitors who lack innovative new products preempted the start of our marketing programs for our new laundry detergent products and for P&G's new Tide Simply Clean & Fresh product by putting unprecedented levels of trade and coupon spending behind their brands to disrupt our launches. The increased competitive trade spending was a key driver of the 5% decline in the liquid laundry detergent category in the first quarter and has temporarily impacted the trial of our new laundry detergent products. However, as you know from our long history of success, one of Church & Dwight's greatest strengths is our ability to respond quickly and effectively in response to changing circumstances. So we have taken actions designed to restore our competitiveness and drive strong trial behind our great new laundry detergent products, just as we did on our new cat litter. I will not divulge or answer any questions concerning specifics of what we have done for competitive reasons. I will just tell you that I'm extremely confident that these actions should enable us to deliver our 2014 sales and earnings per share commitments. I'm also pleased to report the continued strong growth of our most recent acquisition, the Avid gummy vitamin business. Despite increased gummy competition and some negative press concerning the benefits derived from taking multivitamins that hurt the overall category growth, we delivered double-digit consumption growth in the first quarter and are maintaining our double-digit sales and consumption growth outlook for the full year. This sales growth will be driven by the launch of new vitamins for kids and adults, increased retail distribution across our full line of products and increased marketing spending. These actions will help to maintain our strong #1 share position in kids' gummy vitamins and significantly grow our #1 share position in the adult gummy vitamin category by encouraging adults to switch from swallowing hard pills to enjoying our delicious-tasting gummy vitamins. Please keep in mind that the adult vitamin category represents $6.8 billion in sales, and gummy vitamins as a whole represent only 6% of those sales. The adult gummy segment has already doubled in size in the past 18 months, and that still leaves 94% of the total category as upside. We doubled our ad spending on gummy vitamins in 2013, and we are increasing our advertising spending by at least 30% in 2014 to continue to divert adults to our delicious-tasting gummy vitamins. I'll now turn the call over to Matt who will give you specific details on our first quarter business results.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. First quarter EPS was $0.73 per share, and that compares with $0.76 in 2013. That's 4% less than a year ago. The $0.73 was a little better actually than our $0.72 outlook for the first quarter. The negative drag of FX in the quarter reduced year-over-year EPS by 1.5%. Our reported revenues were up 30 basis points to $782 million on the organic side. Organic sales was up 1.2%, which was in line with our Q1 outlook of 1% organic sales growth. So of the 1.2% organic growth, approximately 4.4% is due to volume, with 3.2% negative product mix and price. And of that 3.2% negative price mix, approximately 2% is attributed to investments in slotting and couponing in our U.S. business, and this is behind our 2014 new product launches, which we showcased in February when we provided our full year outlook. Now let's review the segments. The consumer domestic business's organic sales increased by 40 basis points in the quarter, reflecting sales of OxiClean liquid laundry, ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal cat litter and higher sales of our vitamin -- or Vitafusion vitamins. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER and XTRA detergents. Volume contributed approximately 4.4% to U.S. sales, partially offset by 4% negative effect of product mix and price. With respect to negative product mix and price in the U.S., slotting and couponings behind our new products accounted for 2.2% negative price mix. International organic growth was flat year-over-year. The volume decreased approximately 60 basis points, while we had positive price mix of 60 basis points. Canada and Mexico contracted in Q1 net, which was offset by partially by a growth in -- year-over-year in the rest of the world. For our specialty products division, organic sales increased by 12.4%. The animal nutrition business drove a 15.3% volume increase, which was partially offset by a 2.9% unfavorable price mix. The U.S. dairy industry is very healthy right now, which is driving demand for our products. As you saw on the release, we expect total company organic sales for the year to be at the low end of our 3% to 4% range, and Jim will comment more on that later. With respect to gross margin, our reported first quarter gross margin was 43.4%. That's 150 basis points contraction from year ago first quarter. The decrease in gross margin, again, is primarily due to slotting and couponing investments behind our new products. This alone accounted for 100 basis points of the drag year-over-year. And the balance of the drag is due to -- primarily due to premium distribution costs that we experienced in the first quarter due to weather, it shouldn't -- no surprise to everybody, and also some negative mix driven by the strong Specialty Products results, which, of course, have lower gross margins. Regarding commodities, our input cost trended up in Q1, and in particular, this is due to resin, which is at a 3-year high. And for the full year, we expect gross margin to contract 50 to 75 basis points, largely due to price competition in the laundry category. We previously expected 2014 gross margin to be comparable to the prior year, and we'll say more about that later. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $88 million or up 11% -- or 11.2% of revenues. This is 110 basis points higher than the prior year spend rate and $9 million higher in dollars. We continue to support new product launches and grew dollar share on 3 of our 4 mega brands in the quarter. And this is due to the great execution of our sales and marketing teams. Now SG&A. SG&A year-over-year was lower by $12.3 million in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.5%. This is approximately 160 basis point decrease from the prior year first quarter, and this is in part due to the absence of transition expenses related to the Avid acquisition that occurred in the prior year first quarter, as well as lower legal costs. This is a reflection of our continued vigilance to control SG&A. And you may remember, when we gave our outlook for the full year, that we are expecting 2014 full year op margin expansion to be driven by SG&A, and we got off on the right foot in the first quarter. Now operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20.7%, which was 100 basis points lower than last year's 21.7%. But again, this reflects our investment behind the new products. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 34.5%. This compares to last year's 34% or 50 basis points higher year-over-year. Remember that the Q1 2013 rate was favorably affected by retroactive reinstatement of R&D credits last year. We expect the full year 2014 effective rate to be approximately 34.5%. Next, I'll comment on cash. We generated $102 million of net cash from operations for the first 3 months of 2014. This is a $30 million increase over last year, where we spent $6.3 million in CapEx in the quarter, and it's a $4 million decrease from the prior year. On a full year basis, we expect to spend approximately $85 million on CapEx. I'm going to comment on share buybacks next, but I'm going to preface my comments on the share buybacks with just a comment on cash flow. We expect full year cash from operations to exceed $525 million in 2014. That will be a record for us, so we did deploy some of that cash in the first quarter. The company purchased 260 million through ASRs in Q1. You may recall, in February, at CAGNY, we said we repurchased 140 million of shares. And since then, we did an additional 120 million for a total of 260 million. And the way to think about the 260 million, of the 260 million, approximately 75 million was purchased under our Evergreen program, which is established to cover share creep. And the balance, 185 million, was purchased under our $500 million share repurchase program. So we have $350 million remaining under that authorization, and the company anticipates purchasing additional shares in 2014. I'm going to wrap up right now. The first quarter results include 1.2% organic sales growth with a 4% EPS decline, as we invested behind the launch of our new products. We expect second quarter earnings of approximately $0.61 per share, which is the same as the prior year. I'm sure many would have liked EPS to be higher. However, our plans for our new products require a significant increase in marketing spending, so we expect Q2 to be the highest quarter of the year for marketing spend. A couple other comments. As we mentioned in the release, Q2 organic sales is expected to be 3% in the second quarter, and gross margin is expected to contract 100 basis points. And again, this is primarily influenced by the remaining slotting investments and also more price competition in the laundry category. I'll turn it back to you now, Jim.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I'll finish up our portion of the call today with a few words on our outlook for the full year. As stated in the press release, we have updated our 2014 guidance to reflect the organic sales growth at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, and we've tightened our earnings per share growth to 7% to 9%. These results, we've driven by our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of our innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and tight management overhead costs. Our 7% to 9% earnings growth target is a tighter band than our initial 6% to 10% earnings growth target, but is still in the upper quartile of EPS growth targets in the CPG industry, consistent with our historical performance. And we believe we can deliver within that aggressive range despite the highly competitive environment and weak U.S. consumer demand. The majority of our annual earnings growth is planned to occur in the second half of the year, since the first half includes a significant increase in slotting, couponing, trade promotions and incremental advertising for our new product launches versus what we've spent last year. We are also aggressively pursuing acquisitions and a significant financial firepower to make them. As you know, we have a great track record of making highly accretive acquisitions, because we are very selective of the type of businesses we acquire. That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I guess I'll try 2. You're saying your organic sales growth will be 3% in the second quarter, and that's better than the first quarter. Can you break that out to U.S. Consumer versus Specialty? I'm just wondering if that is going to be driven primarily by Specialty. Or will the U.S. Consumer be stronger than in the first quarter? And then my second question is on the SG&A ratio, which is down 150 basis points. And it's normally been, not just last year, but for several years, it's been more around 13% in the first quarter, and now it was 11.5%. Is that you scurrying around and cutting costs as much as you can to make your numbers? Or is the SG&A ratio permanent -- maybe for the whole year, down 150 basis points, and can it continue to go down in the following year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: That sounded like more than 2 questions, Alice. That's all. With respect to the first question, say, yes, right, in the first quarter, we were up 1.2% for the total company. And as everybody can see in the release, that the Specialty Products business was up significantly, with domestic up 40 basis points and the international business up -- actually flat year-over-year. In the second quarter, we're expecting a similar performance from the Specialty Products business, but that is not going to be enough to drive us to a 3%. My expectation is that the combined Consumer business should grow approximately 2% in the second quarter, and that the -- and that will be U.S. and international, and that the Specialty Products business might generate the rest. Those are round numbers, but that's the way to think about the second quarter. What was -- your next question was on SG&A, or do you have a second one on?
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Well, first, with the 2% for Consumer, is the U.S. going to be up more or less than that 2%?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: No, I wouldn't want to get a bit more granular than that. I think that the combined will be up 2% approximately.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes, and then the other would be SG&A ratio.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. So SG&A, so in the first quarter, you saw we were down 160 basis points year-over-year. And we called out a couple of things that happened in the quarter. One would be the Avid transition expenses. So of that 160, 40 that was attributed to those 2, so 120 for the rest. I don't think it should be any surprise to anybody. We expect SG&A to drive our op margin expansion this year. Because remember, when we started the year, what we said was that we have flat gross margin and pretty much flat marketing, right? So we'd said 45% gross margin and 12.5% marketing, with all of our op margin expansion coming from SG&A. So that is as expected, and I wouldn't use the word scurrying around, there's not a lot of scurrying around here. We have a pretty tight plan with respect to where we're going to get to that save year-over-year, so we do expect that on a full year basis. We're going to be down probably over 100 basis points. So you probably sit in there trying to figure out how you're going to get to the midpoint of the range, and you work on your model. So I'll save everybody a lot of trouble. So if you're saying, "All right, the company said, the low end of the 3% to 4% range, but -- so then you'd be anywhere. Let's pick 3% organic sales just for fun." And we'll say organic -- we said gross margin was going to be 50 to 75 basis points down, so let's say down 60. That will mean your SG&A have to be down around 150 basis points to get 50 basis points of op margin expansion on a full year basis.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: How about the marketing ratio for the year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Say again?
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Will the marketing ratio for the year still be flat or...
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, yes. So in my -- the way I'm talking you through it is, is if you had the low end of the range of 3%, and you picked the midpoint of that gross margin around 60 down; kept marketing where it was, 12.5%; and you say, "Okay, SG&A, down 110." That math gets you to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. So -- and clearly, we have -- well on our way with respect to how the first quarter panned out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So you guys have a great history of delivering the double-digit earnings growth historically. I know you're pretty proud of that history. I'm just wondering if -- as we think about this year and the high single-digit earnings growth, it seems like it's a pretty ambitious goal in light of the current competitive environment and clearly, repurchases and SG&A leverage are helping you drive that earnings growth. So I guess, it feels like you're stretching a bit more to hit goals. Is that a fair point? And also, as you think about the strong innovation pipeline, how do you kind of marry the need to invest behind the pipeline for stronger growth beyond this year versus potentially depressing EPS growth by investing behind that strong pipeline this year?
James R. Craigie: I would tell you to kind of think of this year as a year where we're investing for the future and yet, still delivering an earnings per share growth that I think is at the upper end of the industry. So I kind of look at it as a win-win. We always want to be in that top quartile in earnings growth. In this case, we're below 10%. So if it wasn't for foreign exchange, we'll be in double digits, but we're slightly below 10%. But more importantly, we're investing in the future with all the great new products and the strong advertising support. I would tell you to keep in mind, some of our competitors are actually cutting advertising. Procter's announced last year, they're going to cut $1 billion out of their marketing spending. And we're keeping our marketing spending strong. And we also told you previously, we're actually focusing that a little bit before -- more behind our 4 big mega brands. So we're very excited with the fact we got the best new product pipeline we've ever had this year. We're investing behind it. That's why the first quarter and the second quarter are down or flat versus EPS. So we've expect some very strong growth in the back half of the year. But investments is the right way to think about it, but still delivering very strong earnings growth compared to our competition.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on the repurchase front, 260 million this quarter is a big step-up from recent trends. So can you talk about what changed here to make you more aggressive on that front? And does it signal at all that acquisitions are less likely? Because it didn't sound like that based on the commentary, but I'd love to get an update there.
James R. Craigie: No, I wouldn't say that acquisitions are unlikely. And with respect to share repurchase, the high watermark for the company in the past was around $250 million a few years ago. So we have been at that level before, and it's a way to think about what was built into the numbers and where are we now. So when we start the year, you're faced with question marks about retailer acceptance of our new products, consumer trial, the impact of Simply Tide. FX became topical even for us, even though we were only 20% international. So that's more of an issue for us this year than in prior years. And input costs have also been -- is also a question mark and then you come to share count. So you have some levers that were all in question marks with respect to that wide range of 6% to 10%, which we've now tightened. So our expectation was to purchase shares this year, up to around $250 million. So that's how we started the year, depending how things would go. So that's what we did in 2 pieces, $140 million in February, and we did a little bit more in March, $120 million. And then looking at it right now, we'd say, "Okay, we have $350 million remaining on our authorization." We don't expect to exhaust that, Dara, or even exceed half of the remainder. But we will do some more before the year's out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I guess I want to delve into a little bit on the consumer side, and maybe if you could talk about what you're seeing with consumer trends, the premium side versus the value side. So the laundry, I know right now, is challenged with some of the external factors. And even I think when you go to some of your key retailers, you're seeing some outrageous promotions out there, good for me, bad for you. But at the same point, with gummy kind of in that double-digit range, can you talk more about the personal care innovation that's coming out this year? Because it kind of feels like on the consumer side, maybe this is the swing factor to kind of delivering better than what you thought. Last year's innovation, I thought, was good. But excluding Avid, it only grew like very low single digits. So can you talk a little bit about that and how much of that is a bifurcation between premium and kind of the value consumer?
James R. Craigie: Yes, I'll be glad to, Jason. First of all, when you look at the first quarter results, we're in roughly 14 categories, and half of them were down, the half were up. So that's not great. We wish it was -- more than half were up. We're excited about the personal care side of our portfolio this year. We've got some great new products. Our FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits have -- the first and only pregnancy kit that tells you 6 days before your missed period. Every time, it's gone up a day, the first guy to have it usually benefits the category, so that's very premium-priced. So that's just launched, we're excited. On Nair, we have a whole new line of products going out under Argan oil, new moisturizer on the products, new ingredient. That's hitting market and off to a great start. On the vitamins, we launched a vitamin-plus line on both the kids side and the adult side. That's, again, got better-than-average company margins on it. We expect that to do very well and drive double-digit sales growth this year. Oral care is probably the best year we've had in a long time. We have a whole new line going out under the Truly Radiant name for both toothpaste and toothbrushes. It's got great new distribution. Our early share results are up there, and we're very excited about that. We had a lady -- the TV talk show, The Biggest Loser, who is our spokesperson. The ads are terrific, and that product's off to a very good start. And that's, again, all premium-priced products. And then TROJAN, we have some new condoms, vibrators and lubricants going out, again, very high-premium price in terms of margin in that. So now we've got a very strong portfolio on the personal care side of the world. And also, we told you before, the household side, the cat litter is our star for the moment because it's out the earliest and doing great, but we have new laundry detergent forms. OxiClean, as you know, which is, prior to the company average margins, has got lot of tough stuff out there. The laundry detergent, new bleach-like product, new dish-washing product out there. So our guns are loaded. We're supporting it. The advertising's very strong. And Matt told you before, the second quarter advertising is going to be the highest of any quarter of the year to drive the trial, and we've done stuff on the pricing side, as I say, to make sure we're competitive.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just on that point about you saying the marketing in the second quarter is the highest, is that dollar or percentage of sales? And does that imply, I guess, based on Alice's question that the second half marketing spending will be down year-over-year just on the comparisons?
James R. Craigie: Yes. So we got a front end -- it's more front-end loaded, right? So it's pretty much both on the percentages and the dollars that's been the highest for the year for Q2. And that means, obviously, we're pulling things forward to get behind the new product launches.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, good. And then just a housekeeping, just with the buybacks, can you provide any color in terms of where we should model share count for the second quarter and just to the full year?
James R. Craigie: Yes, on a full year basis, where we are right now, it's round numbers, be 139 million shares, and you can -- for average shares on a full year -- if you want to use a full year weighted average number.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. So then for the second quarter, we're looking for something in the high 130s then?
James R. Craigie: Yes. I just want to make sure that you understand it. So where -- when I say where we are right now, we bought back $260 million worth of shares, so your round number denominator would be 139 million shares to calculate EPS. And I already commented on how much more we might buy for the remainder of the year, so you can do the math on that and you adjust the 139 million downward.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Right, but in terms of incremental, what you might buy, is that in your guidance of 7% to 9% or not?
James R. Craigie: Yes.
Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's in your guidance? Okay.
James R. Craigie: Right, but it's a range.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of quick questions on the laundry category. You mentioned that it was down 5% in the first quarter. Can you remind us what that number was in the fourth quarter in terms of the category decline?
James R. Craigie: The total laundry category, including liquid powder and the unit dose, was down about 2.9% in the fourth quarter last year. And I believe the number, we're pulling it right now is -- because we often confuse liquid and everything else like that. I'm sorry, it was down 2.2% in the fourth quarter, and it was down 3.9% in the first quarter of this year, all types of laundry products.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, so a meaningful deceleration there. In terms of Tide Simply, curious what you're seeing from the impact, from that launch at this point? Is it still too early to tell, or are you seeing much in a way of any share loss there?
James R. Craigie: Yes, it's too early to tell, Joe. There's a lot going on with the category. Our new product launches, the couponing and trade spending by some of our competitors has clouded the water a little bit like that. It's just too early to tell. We're very happy we got incremental distribution on both our ARM & HAMMER and OxiClean laundry products. And now we started to drive quality, increase advertising and the trade and coupon spending.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just one last one on Avid. I guess, the VMS category did slow down a little bit in the fourth quarter. There were some negative articles being written, I guess. Have you seen that category start to accelerate again in the first quarter? Or is that going to take a couple of quarters before that plays out?
James R. Craigie: Yes. No, you're right. There was some press out there that unfortunately got blown out of sight. The press was very narrow -- or actually, the studies done were very narrow about -- focusing on cardiovascular disease and cancer. The newspeople in the world kind of expanded that to be some very broad headlines that multivitamins weren't effective. So it caused a bit of dent in the category. We're happy and fortunate that we're on the growth side of the category, and we have some incredible -- with the gummy side of the business which has been and will continue to be the growth part of the business. So I think the category will respond. We did a lot of due diligence when we bought this business, and we were warned by the people in this business that these kind of things will happen. They'll be relatively short lived and the things go back. So I think there'll be a pretty quick bounce back in the category on this. As most people take vitamins to supplement their nutritionary [ph] needs, and most people have gaps in their nutrient needs, so I think this bad press will quickly pass through and the category will start growing again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was intrigued by the other press release you guys put out this morning, talking about Walmart's initiative on sustainability and the implications potentially on laundry compaction. Can you talk about how that's progressing in your dialogue with Walmart, what you expect going to go forward and what the implications could be for your business?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Jason. Yes, that's late-breaking news. We are very happy to see Walmart announce that initiative of at least 25% compaction by 2018. We're very strongly behind all this. We think it's great for the environment, and we'll be working very closely with Walmart to make this happen as soon as possible.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: When they talk about compaction, do you think that includes the unit dose, or is that just referring to traditional liquid?
James R. Craigie: They're referring to traditional liquid.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And lastly, on unit dose, it continues to capture more and more share of the overall category, with liquid really driving it. Any plans for you to get into the liquid unit dose category?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, Jason. I would take the question. What you said -- it's -- the category kind of flattened out around 8%. Procter launched their Gain version of it, called Gain flings. And so the unit dose is up to about 10%, and it's kind of flattening out there. So I think that's where we're going to see the category plateau at, and I don't care to comment about what we do in terms of new products in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just had 2 follow-up questions, and I'm not sure if I just misunderstood. But on the guidance for the revenue growth for the back half, 2 things. The reduction was sort of leaning towards the low end of the previous guidance. That's all a price mix issue. And so if you had given us volume expectations for the year, that would be unchanged. Is that right?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, I can tell you what the expectations are for the year.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Well, the question is -- you're saying it's a more competitive environment, but does that mean that you expect less market share expansion or less category growth on the volume side?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: I'm not sure I follow your question.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You're effectively lowering your top line, and I'm trying to understand why.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, we said that there's unprecedented price competition in the laundry -- our laundry category, so that's influencing the full year call.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So that's affecting your market share outlook or your pricing outlook?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: It's pricing, not market share. As Jim said earlier...
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So your volume outlook for the year hasn't changed?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Say again? Our share outlook for the year hasn't changed.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And your volume, your underlying volume growth outlook for the year hasn't changed?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: That's correct, that's correct.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got you. And my second question is, if the full year revenue growth, let's say, is going to be 3% on an organic basis, but it's only looking like it's kind of 1.5% to 2% in the first half, why exactly it's going to accelerate in the back half? Because I would think all of your new product shipments are actually happening in the first half.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. Just kind of remember, we -- even in the first quarter, we had a 200 basis points drag on our top line organic, because of year-over-year incremental slotting and couponing. So all of that is -- it happens in the first couple of quarters of the year. And the absence of that have been -- that you remove that boat anchor in the second half.
James R. Craigie: Right. And the great trial we're driving behind all the great new products will pay off more in the second half of the year without the drag of the coupon and slotting cost, which heavily hit the first half. All that is netted in our sales numbers in the first few quarters.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So but for the back half of the year, you're looking for organic revenue growth close to 4%?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, that's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess, 2 more questions related to the laundry category. Aside from it being more -- there'd be more competition, more price intensity, is there -- has anything else surprised you in terms of the nature of that competition, who's driving it, which companies, which brands beyond Simply year-to-date? I guess...
James R. Craigie: Yes. I would say my perspective on it. It wasn't really a total surprise. I've been concerned about this happening for a while. As you know, the weak economy that we've had since 2009 has encouraged consumers in a lot of categories to trade down. We took advantage of that behind our great line of value detergents and some launching -- by launching great new products, increasing advertising support, particularly in ARM & HAMMER. That's led to 5 straight years of share gains for us on ARM & HAMMER. And now, like we've told you before, we're now the #2 laundry detergent company. So our competitors were getting frustrated. We saw that. I feel P&G kind of through the match in the gas by launching a half-priced version of Tide. We responded to that with innovations. We had a whole new line of all ARM & HAMMER pods [ph] called Clean Scentsations out there, and we launched the OxiClean laundry detergent. But unfortunately, a couple of our competitors, namely Henkel and Sun, responded by lowering some feature prices and dropping a lot more coupons at higher values out there. We would never lead such tactics, but we'll be competitive. So we responded to that in the second half of the year to support our targets, and that's where it is. But I think we are doing the right thing and -- by driving innovation initially and -- but like I said, we will not be uncompetitive.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess related to it, the second part is, what are your retailer counterparts saying related to all this price investment? I guess, their margins are benefiting from the trade spend, but category growth obviously is suffering. So what's their perspective on it? Are they getting frustrated as well? Is there pressure from that constituency to alter the game?
James R. Craigie: I think it's a good -- great question. I think it's too early to call that. Don't forget, there's 2 parts to it. They -- the retailers see the trade promotion dollars, and that affects their same-store dollar [ph] range, and that drives some of the category. What's not captured by the retailers, they don't get affected by it or by the categories, all the coupons. And all the coupons that are dropped through the papers and that have been pretty huge. Again, the retailer is immune from that because that doesn't affect the selling price that they get. So it's kind of a mixed bag there, but it certainly isn't good. We said in an earlier answer, the category was starting to rebound in the fourth quarter of last year, and we're rather excited about that and looking forward to a year being driven by innovation, and then the competitive actions to lower prices has kind of hurt the category short term. And I don't know how long it will last. I'm not sure. But we have the firepower to stay competitive on this to deliver our targets.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Can you tell me a little bit more -- just on the gross margin side, you're taking out the pricing, marketing mix. Are there other initiatives going on? I mean, would you -- excluding that, see some meaningful gross margin expansion and maybe talk about it, we've exhausted everything out of Victorville? Or are there other initiatives on the horizon? And the kind of the commodity outlook, is that a headwind, a tailwind, any change in the quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, Bill. The -- with respect to the gross margin, the types of things, you get all the fanfare and the headlines are new plants. We built the York plant, and we built the Victorville plant. But even aside from that, we always have programs in place to expand gross margin, because we're always dealing with inflation year-over-year. So that continues to be a hallmark of the organization. So I wouldn't say that absent building plants, that we wouldn't -- going to have continued to focus and have meaningful initiatives in place over the next 3 years, so it will help us expand gross margin.
James R. Craigie: Yes, but I would chime in too. Keep in mind things we've heard about that are coming through the benefits are. We put a cat litter line into our York plant about a year ago, and that's paying huge benefits. And we're in the process of putting expanded capacity in for our gummy vitamin plant into our York facility, and that'll generate cost savings too. So we have good projects ahead of us. We have a 3-year pipeline of Good to Great savings we call ahead of us. So it's always been a hallmark to the company. We're extremely aggressive about it. It's in our -- it's in the -- 25% of everyone's bonus at this company is based on hitting the gross margin improvement targets. So a lot of focus on and around here and a great pipeline of projects and some big -- that includes some big projects.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the compaction question, I know Walmart said by 2017, 2018. If it was sooner, like say 2015, when would you hear about it, and how quickly could kind of convert to that?
James R. Craigie: Bill, this is honestly late breaking news that's just come out there. Like I said, we totally support it. We believe it could happen sooner and bigger, but we have to work all that out with Walmart in that. So that's all to be seen. It's just late breaking news and we're again, just very -- we've always been a big supporter of compaction, and we will be in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the lind of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division: This is Brian Doyle in for Caroline. I just had one on laundry. Within the ARM & HAMMER brand, specifically, I was wondering how much of an offset, even though it was down, how much of an offset was the new product line, and whether that will be maybe a bigger help over the balance of the year? And then my second question was just kind of on the model, bridging the 5% or mid-single digit EBIT growth to 7% to 9% on EPS. Is that largely -- I mean, I realize share count is doing a lot of the work there, but I was wondering if there's any other benefit from either the equity earnings or other income line that you're also expecting there.
James R. Craigie: Yes, Brian, I'll take the first one. If I recall that my number's right, the ARM & HAMMER brands, liquid laundry detergent share went up about 0.5 share point in the first quarter, and the new line, the new product line called Clean Scentsations, I believe, delivered about 0.7% share growth. So you can see it drove all the share growth and then some on the brand in the first quarter. Second question, let me toss that one to Matt?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, your question on -- your second question is with respect to if you wanted to get to the midpoint of the range, back to my earlier comments, what the impact of the line item JV and other income and interest expense would be?
Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Yes, just whether those 2 would get any better.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: I don't they're not going to get any better. I think on a full year basis, I think a good estimate would be probably $6 million to $8 million improvement year-over-year.
Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division: On a combined basis?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, all in, JV, other interest.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions. First, given that competition is accelerating and macros are getting a bit tougher, can you talk about what gives you confidence that things do improve in the second half? And how much of your changes sort of the lower end of the plus 3 is due to the category growth rates? I assume that if I heard you correctly, you expect your market share assumptions haven't changed. So is it all category growth rates? And maybe you could elaborate a little bit on that.
James R. Craigie: Yes. We're in a lot of categories. But overall, I would say we've always planned for the worst and hoped for the best. So we don't expect much improvement in the care category growth rates, much at all. We are -- our plan is heavily driven by the innovations driving improved share results. As I told you, our first big one out the door, that's -- the first market grows [ph] on cat litter, the results are spectacular to date, and we hope to see similar results like that because we think we have a great new product line. They've been tested thoroughly with consumers, consumers love them and we're putting our money where our mouth is in terms of spending to drive, first, the distribution in terms of slotting fees and now the trial with advertising and couponing and trade support behind them. So we're not counting much on all about category improvement. If that happens, that's terrific, but we're mostly driving the share of our products through our great new product innovations.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then on the second half, talk a little bit more about what gives you confidence beyond the new products, given that the environment just gotten a whole lot tougher.
James R. Craigie: Well, first, I would say 2. We're holding up our advertising spending to where it was a year ago. And the word we have, our tracking measures all show is that almost all of our competitors have cut their advertising spending. So we expect our share of voice in the marketplace to switch. It always -- we measure our advertising spending by to be greater than our share of market, and that's the formula that we've had in the past and will be in the future to drive your business results. So we expect to be very competitive and actually be driving growth of our brands through our strong advertising spending. And then you put that behind a great new pipeline of products and you got it. So -- and our sales force has done an excellent -- the incremental distribution we got was tremendous. So again, the whole thing about Q1, the first step was getting incremental distribution, we got it. Q2, we're turning on the gas in terms of marketing spending, we got it. And I just think that's a great formula that'll kick in. And as Matt said in the second half of the year, we get relief from the fact of all the slotting fees and that, that we spent in the first half go away to help drive the gross margin which gets into the net selling prices positive. So this is an age-old formula, but it works and we do it very well and it starts with the great new products and then executing. And we've got a great sales force and marketing team to execute on it. And it's done it before, and we think it'll do it again.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Jim, like this laundry battle that's going on right now, is this like an all Friday, is this a conflict that will last a couple months or is this just like a full-out war? Because you go back to historical battles like this, even the cereals stuff in like the '90s, and it was like a 2- or 3-year period where people got really stupid. And there's no end game, all it was sort of like zero sum and this like trajectory down. So yes, maybe some commentary on how long you think it will last and like what the sort of end game is for everybody to kind of do this?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Bill. I really -- I mean, I don't control that all. Obviously, I just had my side of it. I don't know. I can say one point of view that the actions by the competitors were simply to take their users out of the marketplace before our great new products hit and some of the Procter products hit, so it could've been a short-term defensive action to just try to pull aside their users. But as I've said to you before, if they want to continue this out, we will not lead it. But we'll be right there with them, competitive, and we'll see what happens. And I really can't go any further [indiscernible] issue for both competitive and legal reasons.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got you. And so -- I mean, would you go nuclear [ph] though and then abandon the EPS algorithm if it kind of persisted?
James R. Craigie: I would never do that.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then just a follow-up. I'm trying to do 2 questions in one so you don't hang up on me. These OTC deals like the Merck, Bayer -- the Bayer thing, I'm not sure they want the sun care and Dr. Scholl's business there. Was that something you guys would be interested in at all? And then lastly, how much of that SG&A reduction is going to be reversed in incentive compensation accruals? Because I know gross margin is a big component of your payout and obviously, you're not going to hit it this year.
James R. Craigie: Yes. Bill, on M&A, you know we can't comment on things like that. We have very defined criteria for finding deals and looking for products that are #1 or 2 or in their categories. And the higher gross margin in our category, have future growth capability, NRIs and have -- asset light, that's what we prefer. That's what we comb the marketplace for. We're very aware of everything going on out there. So we're always open at looking at stuff and we'll make judgments, but I hope the Street and our shareholders respect the fact we're very diligent and disciplined about how we look at acquisitions, and we'll continue to be that way. So that's, that.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. Your other question that was probably for the benefit of the 3,500 employees that are listening, incentive comp...
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: [indiscernible]
Matthew Thomas Farrell: It's a little -- you remember, we have 4 components to our incentive comp, right, sales, gross margin, EPS and cash. And as we pointed out in the release, expected a record year for free cash flow or cash from operations, I should say. So look, it's still early, Bill. So we wouldn't be making comments on that at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Steib - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: My question relates to Avid. Jim, you traded your double-digit sales growth outlook for that business for the full year in your prepared remarks, and you called out specifically significant distribution gains. I wonder, what are these, as yet untapped distribution opportunities then that you still have? And is that really the main driver of the business' growth at this point?
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Michael. It's not -- it's one of the key drivers. We bought this business. We saw that it was way underdeveloped in terms of distribution. The company we bought it from was a wonderful little family company. They didn't have a lot the resources. They largely had one salesperson. That person largely coverages 5 accounts, and they didn't have the time to get out to the hundreds of other accounts out there, particularly in the food and drug trade. So we have a full-scale sales force supported by brokers, and we have leveraged that to get the full product line out there in all channels of distribution in that. So that's been a big plus, but also, we've been -- I told you we doubled the advertising last year. We're going to take it up at least north of 30% this year. We're putting out new product lines on both the kids and the adults, and we're doing -- driving tons of trials through sampling in that, because our -- the big opportunity for us is really on the adult side. We already have over a 50% share of the kids business. And the adult side, we're #1, but in the share position, but the issue is it's a very small piece, like it's only 6% of all adult vitamins out there. And I think the adult category is 20x the size of the kids category. So -- and our view, it's more like Coca-Cola, there's -- only x percent of the world drinks colas. We look at the fact that only 6% of adults who use vitamins use gummy vitamins. So we believe the upside is 94% to go because I haven't found one person ever in my life who's tasted a gummy vitamin and hasn't preferred it to the hard pill they take. So we're just all about that. It's great upside we're chasing with the -- getting the distribution out there, getting the advertising, getting more new products out there and driving that. So it's -- we love the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.
Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just one question. Could you just discuss the strategy of taking Oxydol -- sorry, OxiClean into 3 new categories this year, in auto, dish and bleach, as well as detergent? And why you didn't choose to keep it to detergent this year with maybe greater focus on it on it? I'd like to get your perspective.
James R. Craigie: Yes. Thanks, Connie. Yes, OxiClean is probably -- there are -- of all the brands we have, we have over 80, but of all the brands we have, it probably has the greatest consumer loyalty than any brand we have. People just rave about OxiClean. I told you to start with there's been nothing but gaining share in the laundry additives category, bigger than the next 4 players involved, and those next 4 players include people like P&G and Reckitt and we just keep growing it. We saw that loyalty. We actually did, 2 years ago, go into the dish-wash additive category over there. It did quite well, which proved -- that had license to expand the dish-washing, all behind the brand. The brand is an -- the incredible strength of that brand is fighting stains, which are key in these sort of 2 other categories. Obviously, fighting stains was key in laundry because we're the #1 laundry additive, and we just saw -- as we just saw -- we saw a hole. We thought that people weren't really talking about that laundry detergents. What they're all focused on other things on the side, and we just thought we're the kings of fighting stains. We thought we have the right to take that into a full-scale laundry detergent because the additives aren't used by everybody out there. So that made a logical choice to go do that. Like I'd said we tested our toes into the auto dish world 2 years ago, got great results as auto dish additive, so we went there. And the bleach, well, where we are today, the additive side, is very close cousin to the bleach. We often say on our own advertising, we're better than bleach because you don't run the risk of staining clothes if you accidentally have bleach in there with colored clothes. So that was a natural for us. So we just see this brand as our next great mega brand, and we thought, "Let's just take it all at once in these categories," and made total sense for as far as with the equity of that brand is, which is great stain fighting and just pound that home into logical extensions. We tested the depth, it made total sense. The products are terrific. Consumers love it, and we just let it loose this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I'm going to head back to M&A, I guess ask it from a little different angle, Jim. I guess, so you still, I guess, sound a bit less bullish than you did going back to CAGNY. I guess, maybe you can talk a little bit about the pipeline. I guess, we spoke during the quarter, and you said some M&A, some of the valuation multiples from an M&A perspective seem, I guess, a bit full, given what the implied multiple is from Merck's consumer health assets, at least in terms of being reported. So I guess, a, kind of what are you seeing? Are you more or less bullish than you were back in February? I know the multiple is still looking a little bit stretched from an M&A perspective.
James R. Craigie: Kevin, I really can't say much. I would just say I think you see, overall, the M&A market is heating up out there with lots of deals happening. That's generally a positive thing, because sometimes, companies buy other things, they don't want the entire portfolio, and we bought brands in the past off that. But we're always looking, always scouring, but I'll go back to what I said a few minutes ago. We're very diligent and disciplined about this. I mean, we are protectors of the shareholders' capital, and we have sets of rules we follow and we're doing -- I just promise you, we're looking everywhere and looking for the right deal. And when the time's right and everything else is right, we'll make that deal. We have plenty of firepower, even with the share buybacks. So we're in a position to have our cake and eat it too as far as buying back the shares we've done and still have the firepower to make a big acquisition.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And how high would you take the debt leverage? And would you be willing to issue equity for the right deal?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: I think that would be very unusual for us to issue equity. As Jim said, that we have the ability to borrow a significant amount of debt and up -- over $2 billion of debt and still be able to hold on to our credit rating. And by the way, the share buyback is not being funded by debt. That's being paid completely out of -- starting the year with $500 million of cash and generating close to $300 million of cash after dividends and CapEx. So we have a great ability to lever up and maintain our BBB+ credit rating, largely because historically, what we do is we do take the leverage ratio up, we immediately direct all of our free cash flow to reduce our leverage ratio and the rating agencies are well aware of that practice, and we would follow it again in the future.
James R. Craigie: Okay. Folks, I have an Analyst Shareholders Meeting coming up here shortly. So I want to thank you for your time this morning. I just want to leave you with a message. We're very excited. First quarter is right on track for us. We accomplished what we want to do in getting all of our great new products out there and a great distribution, and we're all set up to continue that momentum into the back 3 quarters of the year here and right on track to make our targets, so very excited. Year of innovation, think about innovation, we've got the best innovation portfolio out there, and we're putting our money behind -- where our mouth is and supporting it. So we feel very confident in making our targets. So thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning. I want to welcome all of you who took the time, thankfully, to come visit us today in the boardroom of the New York Stock Exchange. I want to thank those listening to our call. I am so excited today, I can't tell you. I have been waiting 6 months for this day. For 6 months, I've had to listen to chatter from our competitors about what they're going to do in 2014. And for 6 months, I've had to bite my tongue because I didn't want to tip off my competitors. I come from a world where you don't tip off your competitors even for 30 seconds. You don't give them any advance notice. Well, today's D-Day for Church & Dwight. Today, we're going to announce the onslaught of new products that we're going to launch this year. It's the greatest launch of new products in the history of our company. I know you heard -- some heard me say before, every year is great. Well, this is truly the greatest. We have never before launched a great new product across every one of our major categories. So today, we get the joy of telling you and telling the world about these great new products. So let me start our presentation today. Safe Harbor Statement, a lot of words, basically says, if you go ahead and buy the stock based on what we say today, which includes forward-looking statements, proceed at your own risk. I think you're very smart to proceed. Opening remarks. Let me give you a New York minute about what you're going to hear today and then capsulize it. Number one, you're going to hear we had very solid Q4 results. We're exiting the year with great momentum. Two, that capped off a great year, our 13th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. I think 2013 was awesome, gang, 9% revenue growth, 80 basis point increase in gross margin, 30 basis point increase in higher marketing spending, 30 basis point decline in our overhead cost, 80 basis point increase in operating margin, 14% increase in EPS, 6 of our 9 power brands grew share. Gang, that's 7 for 7. That's hitting it out the park. A great 2013. And again, Matt will give you the details, but we exit the year with great momentum. The Avid acquisition is exceeding all of our expectations, another great acquisition by our company. So we've stepped back and said, "Okay, great history, a lot of stuff going on in 2014 from our competition. We can crawl into a shell and just play prevent defense." We didn't believe that. We're playing to win. We're coming out to win with a very aggressive but achievable plan. I mean, our numbers, some companies would step back and say, "Well, pullback, invest, invest." Well, we're investing, but we're also delivering 6% to 10% EPS growth, which based on the rest of the competitive industry is top-quartile results. So we're playing to win. We're investing. We're still delivering great results. I've said it before, it's the largest new product pipeline ever in our company. And we're evolving it, too, on our marketing side. We've always had our 8 power brands, 9 with vitamins. We're evolving to 4 mega brands, slight evolution, not revolution, evolution of spending more money on our 4 biggest brands, which will deliver great results. We're off to a good start. It's early. We have strong retailer acceptance of all of our great products, but we don't know final shelving. We don't know final pricing. We don't know final consumer takeaway. So there's a lot to be known. That's why we have a range right now. We're doing a massive onslaught, but there's a lot we don't know yet out there, which makes us come with a range out on the year. And we're not foregoing acquisitions. We're aggressively pursuing additional acquisitions. A pretty hot pipeline out there. And that's all I can say on that today. So with that, let me bring Matt up here to tell you how we finished 2013. Here's Matt.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Okay. Hey, Jim, thank you for that bouncy introduction. I'm going to cover Q4 and full year 2013. Just from the top, you probably remember from our third quarter call that we expected 1% to 2% organic growth for the fourth quarter. We came in at 2.3%. And for the last 2 quarters of the year, Q3 and Q4, we had approximately 5% volume growth. So very strong volume. But we also know in Q3 and Q4, there was a lot of price competition, so that continued in Q4. Gross margin was also a little better than expected, came in up 90 basis points, up year-over-year, resulting in 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. So EPS up 14% in the fourth quarter. Some things I didn't talk about. So you look at the top, you'll see that the reported sales was up 1.6%. The marketing at 14.3% was the highest of the year. I'll show you that in a second. We got nice leverage on SG&A. So that was down 100 basis points. Some of that is because we had some Avid cost in last year's fourth quarter. And you see the effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%. We expected 34% for the year and 34% for the quarter. So it came in about right. And here's the volume and price/mix equation. So you see on -- 5.2% was the volume for the quarter. You see the breakdown by the divisions. And you see, it was a heavy quarter for price/mix of negative 2.9%, landing down to 2.3%. You can see in the international line what happens when you take price, has an impact on your volume. They we're down -- they were up only 30 basis points for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we're proud of that record. And it was the highest quarter of the year for marketing, 14.3%. So now let's take a look at the full year, look back on this. So we had 1.9% top line growth. On a full year basis, the volume was 3.8%. Gross margin up 80 basis points. You may recall that we expected about 75 basis points on a full year basis. So a little bit higher than expected. And the operating margin up 80 basis points. Turning to free cash flow. You know our definition of free cash flow is cash from operations minus CapEx. And the reason this says adjusted is because you may recall, we had a fourth quarter 2012 federal tax payment. It was deferred because of Hurricane Sandy. We paid it in the first quarter of 2013. But apples-to-apples, free cash flow is up 14%, same with EPS, up 14%. So that's a real high-quality year. And then free cash flow conversion, of course, is very important. So it's the relationship of free cash flow to your net income. And we're up 119%. The other thing I want to point out, if I go back to the previous slide is -- oops, actually it's not the previous slide, it's the one after it. If you're following along at home, we're on Slide 13. I want to point out here is, if you look at the effective tax rate, you'll see, okay, 2012, we got a 35.5% rate. And this year, we did 34% rate. So you'd say, "Wow, you got a lot of benefit year-over-year from the effective tax rate." Not true. It was actually all offset on JV and interest and other line. So our operating income was up 14% in 2013 year-over-year, same as our EPS. So that's why we call this a high-quality year. Here's the organic growth by quarter. You can see we ended the year at 2.3%. So that's the highest quarter of the year. Obviously, a little bit helped by Avid because Avid became organic in the fourth quarter. And it was a share story. So of our 9 power brands, we had 6 that grew share year-over-year. While ARM & HAMMER, that's all variance, it was flat year-over-year share-wise and SPINBRUSH and Orajel were down. The gummy acquisition. So net sales up 20% plus year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis. This is a business we acquired October 1, 2012. Well on our way with respect to the synergies. And you probably saw the announcement that we're expanding capacity by 75% in 2015. So that's a $55 million investment, and it's over a 2-year period. So this is our 13th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. You can see on the far right, up 14%, came in at $2.79, which was our expectations for the full year. And here's our cash conversion cycle story. So we're a very metric-driven company. So we think that working capital management is a function of discipline within a corporation. So you can see that in 2011, we had a heroic year. We hit 28 days for our cash conversion cycle. But if you do the math on this, you'll see that if you take receivables, inventory less payables, which we call operating working capital, it's about 10% of our net sales. Here's the free cash flow story. I mentioned that before, $469 million. It's up 14% year-over-year. And we're not a capital-intensive company. So you can see we're 2.1% CapEx as a percentage of sales. You'll often hear us talk about, we bang around 2.5% in general. By the way, the expectation for 2014 is $85 million of CapEx, of which $40 million of that is the investment in the vitamin expansion. And here's the balance sheet. So you can see, we're levered 1.2x debt to EBITDA. So we got a lot of firepower there. And I'll do the math for you. If you look at this slide, you can see that -- what our borrowing capacity is about $2.1 million (sic) [$2.1 billion]. Assuming we did an acquisition and we levered up to 3.25x EBITDA. So a lot of ability here to go shopping. And you also read that we announced a dividend increase yesterday of 11%. And we've been steadily increasing our dividends over a number of years. And we have a target payout of 40% of net income. And here are the prioritized uses of free cash flow. This should be a very familiar slide to a lot of people. Well, I'm going to start out, as you probably saw in the release that we expect to generate $1.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. And we generated lots of cash. So remember, you saw on an earlier slide, we have $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. If you generate $470 million on an annual basis and your dividend, that we just declared, is $170 million, that's another $300 million. So you got cash on hand. We generate at least $300 million even after dividends and then have the significant borrowing capacity. The other thing you saw on the release is that we announced a couple of share repurchase programs. One is called an Evergreen. The Evergreen program is simply there to enable us to eliminate share creep as options are exercised. And the other one is a $500 million share repurchase program. You probably have some questions about, well, how much of that is going to get spent in 2014 versus ‘15. The way you think about that, this is a multi-year program. Historically, this past year, we bought $50 million of shares in the first quarter. The most we've acquired in any 1 year is $250 million. But this does give us a lot of flexibility with respect to destinations for our cash. And with that, I'm going to go to Jim.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. So great quarter, capped off a great year, but now let's look forward. First of all, I want to tell you, look at the total shareholder return of this company over the past 10 years, which is my tenure as Chairman and CEO. I mean, I just want to stop at this slide for the next hour. But just look at this, 394% return since July of 2004, blows away anybody else in this industry, about 6x the S&P 500. And we did it largely through -- the blue part there is the stock price appreciation and the gold part is dividends. You can see, we've been very driven by driving the stock price but paying a nice dividend on top of this. Some of our competitors are more like bonds, they pay a dividend, but terrific results. So you sit there and say, "Great job, Jim and your team." My team is in the room here today. But what about the future? And I'm going to give you 10 reasons today why I believe we can continue to deliver superior total shareholder return. First of all, you've heard me talk about this a lot, but it's evolving a little bit. We have a recession-resistant product portfolio. If you've seen this chart in the past, you'll notice, it's been slightly tweaked. We used to be 60% premium, 40% value. Now we're 55% premium, 45% value. And I'll show you why in a second. But it's great to have a value part of your portfolio during a rough time in the economy. I showed this slide before about proving the value part of our portfolio. Our laundry detergents have been half the price of the premium brands, same for fabric softener sheets. Toothpaste at half the price of the leading brands, some forms in cleaners. What's new is vitamins. Many of you don't realize, our vitamin business is only about 45% -- about 45% lower than One a Day. So even on the vitamin side, where we got great brand products, they offer great value to consumers. Hey, it's a recession and we constantly show people, consumers have been switching constantly from the premium and mid-priced categories into the value and extreme value categories. In laundry detergent. Now more households buy a value laundry detergent than premium or mid-tier products. You'll see here now the value price segment of the category has now increased the path to mid-tier category, with almost 30% of people buying value detergents. Church & Dwight, of course, is the king of that category. We've gained almost 7 share points in value. And we're now bigger than #2, 3 and 4 players combined, with over half the share of the value segment. Dollar-wise, Church & Dwight is the only company that has grown share in the dollar -- in the laundry detergent category since 2009, significant share growth. Everybody else has lost share. We're second in terms of wash loads because we offer great value. Look at wash loads, what people actually use. In terms of wash loads, we're creeping in very closely to the king of the category and showing terrific growth in our brands. So more and more people are actually using Church & Dwight laundry products. Now you've all heard the big news, which one of my competitors have been talking about for 6 months. Procter & Gamble's coming out with a lower-priced version of Tide. If you want to ask questions about that, call Cincinnati, okay? I don't run that brand. But I ask you 2 questions to think about, I have no answers to, but 2 things we're going to watch the next few months. Will this further accelerate the growth of the value segment? Which has already been growing phenomenally as I've shown you. And two, where’s the volume going to come from? Are they going to come out of their brand, premium Tide or non-Tide users. We don't know. It'll be the big question going forward here, but a major initiative on their part. We don't sit back and say, "Hey, just pullover the covers over our head and defend our business." We believe a great defense or best defense is a great offense. And what we're doing is we're responding in a big way. We're launching 3 major new products in the laundry category in 2014. We're launching a new version of ARM & HAMMER. We're launching the OxiClean brand into the laundry detergent category. And we're launching the OxiClean brand also into the bleach category. 3 major initiatives. Now you want to know the details? You got to wait 10 minutes because I'm going to bring up my 2 geniuses who drive all that, my Head of New Products, Steve Cugine; and my Head of Marketing, Bruce Fleming. They're going to come up here and tell you about the details about that in about 10 minutes when I stop talking. So stay tuned and keep your seatbelts on. The second big thing which drives future total shareholder return is, we believe in building mega brand, new word for us, mega brand. You saw about power brands. We're now talking about mega brands. In the past, we've had 8 power brands. You see the great brands we have. Those were 80% of our revenues and profits. There's the great 8 brands, all #1 or 2 in their categories. I'll show you on Chart 2, they're not just important to us, they're important to retailers. You see the top 10 SKUs in the category, our brands are all part of the top 10, some -- all 10 of 10 in the case of condoms. So our brands are very important to retailers. What's our share growth formula for those? Very consistent formula. We have innovative new products, put increased marketing spending behind that. That gives you increased distribution. Add them all together, you get share growth on your power brands. You can see we've had terrific track record of innovation on these things. Steve Cugine and his genius gang have done a great job. Today, 32% of our business in 2013 was from new products we launched starting back in 2007. So we've flipped 1/3 of our portfolio in that timeframe all driven by innovation. You look forward to how we do on the advertising spending. Here's some new data. This may shock you. Church & Dwight as a company is the 13th largest advertiser in the United States, more than many of the other companies who are much bigger than us in revenue. Look at that chart. Look at the competitors we little Church & Dwight spend more on advertising dollar in the United States than those big names. That tells you how big we are in advertising and how much we've increased our advertising over the year. Later on, Bruce Fleming is going to talk to you about some of our individual brands. And they shock you how much we spend at some of our brands than some of the big players. And our products are taking that because of those great new innovations because of our increased marketing spending. Here's a chart that shows you, if you look at our distribution base back in 2009, how much distribution we've gained on an index basis versus that for all of our brands, very impressive out there. Of course, you add that altogether, you get share growth. And over the last 5 or 6 years, because 75% of the time, we've grown share in categories. I challenge any other manufacturer to show that chart. I doubt they've grown share 75% of the time. Now is an evolution time. We focus on 8 power brands in the past. You have 9 for the new vitamin business. We're putting more of our focus going forward on the 4 big mega brands: ARM & HAMMER, TROJAN, OxiClean and our vitamin business. Why? Because those 4 mega brands represent 60% of our sales and profits. Those 4 mega brands have been a tremendous growth from the past. What's a mega brand, you say? Well, mega brand is a -- a great example is ARM & HAMMER. Here's a brand that covers all sorts of categories. It's found in more aisles in the grocery store than any other brand in America. It's in both premium and value segments. And we've supported a very powerful holistic advertising campaign, very important. It's the right brand at the right time at the right value, terrific business for us. Now how do you drive a mega brand? It's the same formula as the power brand: innovative new products increased marketing spending, increased distribution, that all leads to share growth. But here's the difference. Here's why mega brands are different than power brands for 4 reasons: One, you get a bigger bang for your buck in your R&D investments. You don't have to spend as much supporting other forms. You also get a bigger bang for your buck on marketing investment. There's also greater licensing potential and lower organizational cost. 4 big advantages for a mega brand over a power brand. Let me show you what that means, hey, with ARM & HAMMER. ARM & HAMMER has baking soda. Baking soda has a lot of properties, but you can take those properties and spread them across all sorts of forms across all sorts of category versus being just a one category business. Marketing-wise, $1 spent smartly at any form of mega brand helps all forms of the mega brand. And Bruce Fleming and his team has done a great job the way they do our advertising. That $1 spent, whether it's in a laundry detergent, cat litter, anything helps the whole business. If you're just a one category business, $1 spent just helps you in that one category. Here, $1 spent gets a much bigger bang for the buck. Our 4 mega brands, we're actually going to spend 74% of our advertising next year on those 4 brands. Remember, that's 60% of our revenue and profits, we're going to spend 74% of our advertising dollars because we'll get a bigger bang for the buck on those. Licensing-wise, hey, mega brands, other players want it. There's categories we don't want to launch in directly. We do over 3 -- what does it say? Over $185 million in retail sales, over 400 licenses on the ARM & HAMMER brand alone. That generates licensing fees for us which are very powerful, 100% gross margin. Think about that. And organizationally, hey, when you have a mega brand, you're going to have one team driving a mega brand versus separate teams driving individual brands. So organizational costs are lower on a mega brand. So you got those 4 advantages, all of them helps you drive bigger profits to the bottom line by putting more support behind your mega brands. So Bruce and Steve are going to talk about that shortly. Our 2014 plan reflects that focus. We're going to increase the ad spending, as I told you a moment ago. We'll do more major product launches on every mega brand. And we're going to be entering white space, side categories in these brands and making a bigger mega brand going out there. 5 minutes, wait till you see those details. Steve and Bruce will show you that. So hang on to your seats. Let me talk number 3 reason of the 10 why we're going to keep growing our total shareholder return. We are very good at ferociously defending our brands. A good example there is OxiClean. We bought that business in 2006. It was a 27% share of the laundry additive category. We grew that to over a 40% share in a couple of years. How did we do that? We have great new products, great new claims for that business as we entered new parts of the category. We increased the marketing support tremendously. But then we had a big attack, recognize that guy? Sound familiar? They like to attack us. Back in mid-2009, they came into the category with their big brand name attacking our product. What did we do? Did we just crawl into a hole and say, "Oh, well, give up share, give up profits?" Hell, no. We launched that with all great new forms of OxiClean. We co-branded it with other businesses to give greater marketing power for the business. We increased the ad spending. It's the second most advertised brand in the fabric care category. And what happened? 4 years later through 2013, we not only held our share, we grew our share. And we're bigger now than the 3 other players in this category. And then the little guy, look at the names on that chart as to who we grew share against with OxiClean, pretty big players in the overall world. We beat them back all. We grew the most share. And tell you again, we're bigger than all 3 of them together. So when you think about us being attacked, as we are being right now by a competitor in another part of the laundry category, think about how we've done in the past. Fourth biggest reason is, hey, we're not a big international company. It's about 17% of our business these days, but we're a good player there. We're invested largely 6 countries of the bulk of our business. We've had great results across those franchises with mid- to high-single-digit growth in most of them. Great track record. How did we do that? Some of those markets have, we call, little power brands in those markets, we don't talk about. RUB A535 is a great product up in Canada. Grab All [ph] is a great product there. We've also expanded our corporate power brands or now mega brands into some of those countries. We've also done great with acquisitions. There's a product in the table back there today called Batiste, which is a good dry shampoo. We bought that, largely a U.K. product. We bought it. It's been growing fabulously in the U.K. We're now expanding it to other countries. Terrific growth. And leveraging our One Company strength. We only have one R&D team worldwide. We do the marketing worldwide. Everything to kind of keep our organizational cost down. They take the great news in every country and spread it to the rest. Number 5, expanding gross margin. We love gross margin. Very important to us, have a huge focus on that. We've grown gross margin tremendously over the last 10 years, 1,600 basis points, more than any other company in the category. Look at that chart. Look at the other major players. We've grown almost 600 basis points since 2007 and nobody is even 1/3 of that out there. 4 big parts of that. We have a Good to Great program. That's the name we take from the great book by Jim Collins in that, but it's our cost optimization program. That's the reformulation, resizing, reducing SKUs on that. Second thing is supply-chain restructuring. We build brand new plants. It's much more efficient for us. Acquisition synergies. When we acquire a business, we drive the costs out of it to help their gross margins. And price/mix, we're always about launching new products with a higher price, a higher margin than the product it replaces. Number 6, acquisitions. We've had a great track record on acquisitions. Why? Because we're very careful of what we buy. We only buy a #1 or 2 share brand. We want higher growth, higher margin brands. We want asset-light businesses, meaning, we don't like to pick up businesses with lots of headquarters and lots of plants. We like to leverage our capital base. We have to leverage our strength in manufacturing, logistics and purchasing. And we want a business, we believe, that can deliver competitive long term sustainable advantages. Here's our track record. Look at that, tremendous number all over. We don't just walk the walk, we talk the talk out there. That's why investment bankers come to us constantly. We just don't talk about acquisitions, we do them. Of the 9 power brands I've talked about before, 8 of those we've acquired through acquisition. The only one that was the inherent brand was ARM & HAMMER back 160 years ago. But 8 of our 9 power brands we call today came through acquisitions. And we just don't buy them and milk them. We buy them and we grow them. We drive the share price up with better marketing power, better sales force power, and we cut the cost out of them to drive greater profits for the company. So a great track record on acquisitions. And we're actively looking for new acquisitions. We've got $2.6 billion of dry powder as Matt showed you. We're actively out there looking for it. And we hope to continue to turn those acquisitions into gold for our company. Number 7, Matt alluded to this earlier, we are best in class, not just good at free cash flow, best in class. We've increased the free cash flow over 500% since 2002. And if you look at the statistics, this free cash flow as a percent of net income, nobody is better than us. And we just had another great year of performance. Number 8, overhead management. We don't let any line of the P&L go by. Overhead management, we're great at. We've increased revenues 113% since 2004 and only increased headcount 11%. Think about that. Doubling the revenues of the company and barely have any overhead growth at all. It has resulted in the highest revenue per employee of any major CPG company. Little Church & Dwight, $3 billion, shouldn't be able to do that against guys in that chart as big as $80 billion. But we do it, highest revenue per employee. And effectively, we walk the walk on tight overhead controls. I don't have a company car. Nobody has a company car. Nobody has golf club memberships, no corporate planes. We don't believe in that. That's not good for our shareholders. It's not good for us because we're major shareholders, too. And you say, "Well, how can you get better?" We will. We're doing things with the new health care plans, new information systems, leveraging headcount to go forward. You will see our overhead go down going forward. Number 9, one of my little favorite secrets I've talked about, expert management team. We believe in expertise. My top team of 40 people, they are lifers in their job. My 8 business unit managers, I tell them, you're in that job for life. And so some say well who would want to do that? Well you want to do that when you become experts and drive the great results we do? And those people will have over 20 years of experience. How does that pay off? Well, first, when you saw the share chart earlier. 75% of the time, we beat share because we know our businesses cold, where competitors change people around. They don't know their businesses. We don't make mistakes. Secondly, that enables to minimize headcount growth. Hey, you don't need extra bodies to help you run a business when you know it cold. Execution, third thing. Hey, when you know and you're working with the same people for 20 years, you'd believe me, the execution's great versus not knowing who's running what function doing what. And the last thing is, we bring acquisitions in. Well, my people, they know the business so well, they don't need a full day to run their business. They love new acquisitions. That's what's new to them. They love new things. So we give them new acquisitions, keep the headcount down. Last one, if you add those 9 factors up, you get a bunch of total shareholder return junkies. We love our business. Look at those statistics of how we've grown revenue, gross margin, increased the advertising, cut the overhead, driven the cash flow, driven the EPS. It all pays off. You bought my stock 10 years ago, you'd have an average return of 16.3%. That blows away anybody else in this industry. That blows away the S&P 500. We got a great team of junkies. They're all here today. You're going to see us ring the closing bell today. We love it. We're a great team. We're total shareholder return driven. And believe me, we're 100% in the game. We're right with you as far as people recommending stocks or buying stocks. Our bonuses are tied 100% to business results. 25% of my bonus is based on hitting the net revenue growth goal, 25% is hitting the gross margin goal, 25% EPS, 25% free cash flow. I got to believe those 4 factors are the most important 4 factors in any model you do about companies growing stock. Secondly, we only have stock options. We're not one of these games we got restricted stock or we got some sort of phantom stock. We are based -- our equity competition is 100% stock option. If the stock price doesn't go up, we don't win. Believe me, I was very pissed about yesterday. I can't believe what happened yesterday. I mean, we watch that stock price probably every 2 hours every day. We care about the stock price as much as you do. And we're required to be heavily invested in the company's stock. So that's it. Jim is going to take a seat and have another cup of coffee. And now it's time to bring up my 2 geniuses. They're going to tell you about next year, Steve Cugine. Steve is my Head of New Products and also just took on the additional responsibility, typical at Church & Dwight, of running international business as our Head of International retired after a great career. And Bruce Fleming is my Head of Marketing, my Chief Marketing Officer. These guys work hand-in-hand. They're attached at the hip. Steve develops the great new products with his team and then works with Bruce's team to launch the great new products and the great results we have. So Jim, take a seat. Steve and Bruce, come on down.
Steven P. Cugine: Thank you, Jim. So Bruce and I are very excited to be here today. And we're going to talk about our 2014 new product innovation portfolio. There are 4 key takeaways from this presentation: One, Church & Dwight is built on corporate competency for new product innovation; two, new product innovation has been and will continue to be a critical driver of organic growth; three, innovation supports our mega brand growth drivers; and four, 2014 represents the most significant portfolio of new products in the company's history. So our primary driver of growth is new product innovation. Church & Dwight defines innovation success as new products that drive sustainable organic growth at accretive gross margins with a focus on our mega brands. What you see is our track record for successful new product innovation. The dedicated new products team was started in 2006. In 2013, new products launched by this team will account for $1.1 billion in gross sales and represents over 32% of CHD's consumer domestic sales. Our new products are very sticky and thrives in-market over time. We've created a fundamental capability for innovation at Church & Dwight. We started by separating new product development from brand management and future business from current. We added structure and governance by adding a staged gate management process and executive portfolio reviews just to name a few. We linked our business strategy and innovation strategies with technology strategies, further aligning new product marketing and R&D. We expanded our skills and innovation process knowledge. We had significant front-end training. The result, we have strong capabilities in both commercializing powerful line extensions and in qualifying significant future opportunities for growth by expanding our mega brands into adjacent categories. We believe that great innovation requires 7 critical success factors: One, focus. As Jim mentioned already, we focus on our 9 power brands, with our sharpest focus on our 4 mega brands. Number two, strategic alignment. We link business strategy to innovation strategy and to technical strategy. So we understand where to play and how to win. Number three, compelling consumer insights. Everything starts with the consumer. We started to understand their pain points, needs and desires. Number four, disciplined financial modeling. Unlike many consumer products companies, we manage innovation like it has its own P&L. We are responsible for incremental net sales growth and for accretive gross margins. This helps us to keep it real, improve forecasting accuracy and get rewarded for end market financial performance. Corporate teamwork, number five. Creating new products requires the expertise of every single function in the company, so we lead product teams for each project we deliver. Number six, development of winning products. R&D and consumer research tools are both used extensively at Church & Dwight to validate and optimize our launches. We have a great R&D team that develops products that exceed our concept expectations and wows consumers. Seven, superb execution in market. Sales and marketing come together to deliver incremental SKUs on shelf and great advertising to drive trial. We know that when we drive trial on these great products, consumers, in fact, love them. Following these 7 critical success factors, we've enjoyed great success in innovation at Church & Dwight. Before moving on to our 2014 innovation, however, I'm going to turn the presentation over to my partner in crime here, Bruce Fleming, our Chief Marketing Officer.
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. Thanks, Steve. I see that Jim has been drinking water and coffee is not a good idea, Jim. I think we'll stick to water. I have the pleasure to talk about our brands, particularly ARM & HAMMER. It all began 150 years ago. And those of us who have been here over the last 8, 9 years have just had great pleasure in taking what we thought was a wonderful ship that just needed a little bit of polishing. But 150 years of focus and a renewed 8 to 9 years of focus have resulted in a very powerful brand. Today, ARM & HAMMER is over $1 billion in sales. And we think there's a lot of runway ahead. If you look since 2008, we've grown 44% or about 7.6% compound annual growth rate. You don't find many 150-year-old brands with that type of growth. In fact, you don't find many 150-year-old brands. But I think that speaks to the longevity and the staying power of this great equity. When we first started looking at the brand about 8 to 9 years ago as marketers rather than mere consumers, it is clear to us we had a fairly fragmented presentation to the consumer, and we needed to harmonize it. You've probably seen some of these slides before, but it's fairly obvious. And what we did is we returned to the heritage color of the 1860s. So we really look to the past to develop our future. And it was a good move. It's really grown the business and making it easy for consumers to see our products in every aisle of the store. We did the same thing with advertising. One of the first things, I know, Steve and I did is we talked to the retirees and sort of said, "How did you build this great company?" Of course, it was really quite a legacy that we have inherited. And everyone's answer kept going back to 1972, 1972. What did you do in 1972? Well, we advertised that people should put baking soda in the refrigerator. Steve and I looked at each other and we just sort of said, "Well, that's a novel idea." I don't think any amount of modern consumer research would have said that, that was a good idea, but it was. It grew the business and then about 4 to 5 months, I think about 80% of American homes had a box of baking soda in the refrigerator. And I went back and said, "Well, how did you get that idea?" And they said, "We found a pamphlet from the early 1900s that said, put a saucer with water and a teaspoon of baking soda on top of the ice in your ice chest and it will extend the life of the ice in your icebox." I think it was 1907. So we really didn't come up with the idea. We just went back to the past in order to grow the future. And that's exactly what we're doing today. And we continue to do, is that we have built a business based on the insights of the past and the strongest insights of those that are written in history. I think that if you looked at our advertising over the last 6, 8 years, it's been pretty workman-like. It's pretty much -- it's hard-working blue-collar, like many of us, like many of our consumers. And what was particularly interesting is that we went back to the original baking soda in the refrigerator, but yet, we created enough freedom of expression to advertise all the individual variants of the ARM & HAMMER brand. And you've seen that over the years. And you're going to continue to see that in the future. And over that time, we tripled our media investment. Jim alluded -- well, it's not only advertising. As you can see, we have a holistic campaign across all the important touch points that a true mega brand must touch, TV advertising, of course, print, radio. Public relations plays a big role. Mouth-to-mouth, person-to-person type of accolades about our product are really very important. Digital and social have been extremely important over the last few years. It's a problem solution type of business. And people who have an issue and they need a solution, they're online. And that's where ARM & HAMMER has been. You see a lot of YouTube videos. In fact, I think we've probably set a record for the most number of views for the smallest number of videos, as we benchmark ourselves versus competitors. Our merchandising has been really off the charts in terms of its impact with the renovation of our packaging line back to the old 1860s color. From an advertising perspective, Jim alluded to this, but on a brand basis, it probably is little known that we're the 24th largest advertiser in the United States. We looked at the mega brands that all exist in the United States, added up all the reported media that they spend across all their variants. And there's a rating 1 to 100 in terms of the ranking. So you can see where, we have a lot of good company, a lot of venerable brands that we respect that are both above and below us, but little ARM & HAMMER, little Church & Dwight who competes against people much bigger than us are able to create scale to our voice by focusing our efforts. And that's what Jim has talked about. That's what he's preached. And that's what we've done.
Steven P. Cugine: Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce F. Fleming: And to talk a little bit about the new product innovations.
Steven P. Cugine: So we're going to take you through 2 examples in bringing this to life. One is, the first example is ARM & HAMMER plus OxiClean. The consumer need we identified is for superior stain removal for the value consumer. Our answer, we joined 2 powerful equities in 1 product, ARM & HAMMER and OxiClean. The result, ARM & HAMMER plus OxiClean represents a 3% dollar share of the liquid laundry detergent. It's bigger than Cheer, Era or Wisk. So successful, it spawned an entire plus Oxi segment in detergents. The second example comes from the litter category. Consumers had a problem that we identified which was, the cat owners needed to control both urine and feces odors. Consumers and manufacturers were primarily focused on urine odor. Our answer, ARM & HAMMER Double Duty. At the time of launch, it was the only product to eliminate both feces and urine odors. The result? ARM & HAMMER Double Duty alone has achieved a 7.6% share of the clumping cat litter and is the #4 variant in the entire category. ARM & HAMMER has led innovation in this category, generating a 14% compounded annual growth rate since 1998. Now we're going to show you how we intend to carry our innovation momentum into 2014, starting with exciting news on ARM & HAMMER. We're going to begin with the cat litter category. Odor control is the #1 concern of consumers, which is why our answer to this problem is ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal Cat Litter, with a guaranteed 7-day odor-free home. This is an outstanding new product. It achieves 100% odor satisfaction, delivers superior clumping, no dust and low tracking and commands a premium price point in the $2 billion litter category. Bruce?
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay, Steve. So it's easier to develop very persuasive advertising when you've got a great product like the one that Steve and his team -- our teams put together with the help of R&D and everybody else. The problems are big problems. We provide a real solution. And if you have a cat and you haven't tried this product, I think we have some coupons. I can give them to you as you leave, but it's a great product. And Steve's focus groups, we had to pay for the focus groups, the people were just so compelling that we decided that the best way to advertise this product would be to show real consumer reaction to this wonderful product. So we've tested this advertising like we test all our advertising. I think I've told Jim we have had more advertising tests in the field in the last 6 months than I've seen anywhere in my career for the number of brands that I've had responsibility for. And the advertising you're about to see is going to be -- I'll let you judge for yourself. And I'll tell you the results. If we could roll the tape, please? [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. So if you don't have a buy in our stock, if you look under the table, there's a litter box right next to you, but no doubt, you didn't smell it. The testing of this was really great. It's gratifying. It's the top 20% of commercials in the industry database that most of our competitors use and we use -- it's wonderful that all the hard work is able to be presented to the consumer in a persuasive way. So we're expecting big things this year on cat litter. Now Steve's going to talk about laundry detergent.
Steven P. Cugine: So we're going to focus on a category that has been the engine of growth for Church & Dwight for some time. In laundry detergents, nothing delights consumers like the fresh smell of just washed clothes. In fact, freshness is just about as important as value in the consumer purchase decision. Delivering freshness is what makes our new line of detergents stand out. Our answer to delivering freshness is ARM & HAMMER Clean Scentsations. This great new line is designed to deliver noticeably cleaner, whiter and vibrantly fresher laundry inspired by America's national parks. This line expands our portfolio into the highly fragrant segment, but does it in an ARM & HAMMER way. Bruce, over to you for the advertising.
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. So our challenge is pretty clear. We needed to dial up the freshness, especially because that is a consumer driver for some of the -- our competitive brands, less so for ARM & HAMMER, but we certainly developed a product that delivers. So the advertising, you're going to see, does communicate that message. And as Steve said in an ARM & HAMMER way, we're actually donating royalties to America's national parks as a percentage of sales. And there's nothing -- there's no better way to celebrate an iconic American brand than to support our national parks. And the scents actually, as Steve said, were inspired by them. And I'll let you judge for yourself. And like all the products this year, it's guaranteed or your money back. So we are really stressing performance and also putting our money where our mouth is. So if you could roll the tape on this one. [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: Now this advertising also ranked in the top 20% of the database for the industry for all laundry detergents. So we've got some powerful advertising to support all the good work Lou Tursi and his team have done in getting us distribution. So I'll hand it over to Steve to talk about oral care at this point.
Steven P. Cugine: Great. Thanks, Bruce. Oral care is powered by innovation. So we conducted extensive research to identify what consumers are really looking for in their oral care regime. We found that whitening, enamel strengthening and overall health are really important, yet consumers want to go beyond just whitening. They want to look truly radiant, especially -- specialty whitening toothpaste do a great job of whitening, but you need more than whitening for a radiant smile. Our answer, ARM & HAMMER Truly Radiant, a premium toothpaste that has patented liquid calcium technology and delivers superb whitening, excellent cleaning, while it repairs and strengthens enamel and delights consumers with its outstanding taste. We paired this innovation with ARM & HAMMER Truly Radiant SPINBRUSH toothbrushes. These brushes are designed with axis bristles to reach deeper in between teeth and remove 100% more plaque than a manual toothbrush. Bruce?
Bruce F. Fleming: Yes, I'm really pleased to announce that we're teaming up with Alison Sweeney, the host of the TV show Biggest Loser, to promote and market this product. Strength and beauty is a key component of the product, and this embodies Alison. As we speak, the advertising is being filmed. I look forward to you seeing it on TV and online. I sound like a broken record, but this, too, was in the top 20% of toothpaste advertising in the industry database that we and all our competitors use. It is the highest scoring advertising that we've ever tested on toothpaste. So we're looking forward to making an impression with this product. Okay. Now I have the pleasure to talk about our second mega brand, which truly has become our second mega brand, which is OxiClean. Since we bought it in 2006, it's just proven to me that it's one of the most powerful and resilient brands that I've ever worked on and, I think, of any brand in America. We lived through some incredibly fierce competitive situations, competitive launches that happened coincidentally with the death of our friend and pitchman Billy Mays. He's a very good friend of mine. And it was a hard time back then when really from a personal perspective when Billy passed, but we were in the middle of a competitive situation, and I think that we've emerged with a lot of strength. And it's as much to the great teamwork at Church & Dwight as it is to the strength of this brand. If you look, since 2006, when we bought the business, it's grown 51%, compounded annual growth rate of 6.1%, but there's certainly a lot of opportunity to move beyond stain fighters and wash additives. Like with ARM & HAMMER, it was a brand that just needed a bit of polishing. The packaging was a little bit fragmented, not as much as ARM & HAMMER. It was only a 10-year-old brand, but a marketing person can't help tinker with the packaging. And of course, we did. And as you can see, the iconic OXICLEAN blue helps consumers find our product throughout the supermarket, throughout the retailers. And you see the effervescent cleaning bubbles which are a signature part of our logo. When we went to look at our advertising, we were blessed. We had, as I mentioned, a friend -- I still get a little choked up when I talk about Billy, grew to love him. OxiClean took care of big problems with a big solution. He believed in the business passionately. He was taken from us far too early, but I think this event actually made us stronger. We didn't know exactly how to replace Billy. How do you replace a member of your family? And we went off air for, I think, about 4 to 6 weeks, thought about it, studied every salesperson, pitchperson who had ever endorsed a brand from Orville Redenbacher, to Dave Thomas, to Colonel Sanders. And we decided that we needed to continue in Billy's tradition and find somebody bigger-than-life to take care of this bigger-than-life brand. And Who Better than Billy's real-life best friend, Anthony Sullivan. Sully has become a very close friend of all of ours. He was a little reluctant at first to step into Billy's shoes. He said nobody can fill Billy's shoes. But he's done so, and he's done so admirably. I remember the discussion we had with him, and we said, "Sully, I think what we want to do is honor the man and advance the brand." And that's been our mantra. And if you get Sully at a quiet moment, he'll tell you that, that's been his impetus. So anyway, we've had big demos, bigger-than-life spokespeople cut from the same cloth. Billy pitching on the boardwalk in New Jersey. Sully pitching in the streets of London. And we've developed some compelling advertising that's thematically similar over the years. And again, with the products that we have this year, we're going to guarantee them or your money back. What's little known is that when you look at just fabric care advertising, again, we looked at reported spending across all fabric care brands, slowly but surely, OxiClean has become the #2 advertised brand in the fabric care category. These numbers are indexed to the spending of the market leader over the last year. And you can see that OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER are able to compete despite our relative size versus our major corporate competitors. But we are big in the consumers' minds, and we're big in the advertising arena. But it's not just advertising. You've seen this before in our other brands. We've graduated from selling at county fairs in the boardwalk, but you'd find a lot of our efforts online especially because there are severe problems and solutions that people want to save. They want to save that christening dress. They want to save that favorite garment. And today, no matter your age, you're going online looking for how to solve that issue. And we've done a lot of wonderful things digitally in that business, as well as the traditional public relations and merchandising activity. So I'm happy to say that we finished the year with great momentum. Its all-time high share in the fourth quarter. It's a great platform to grow. And so since our purchase in 2006 of this wonderful company, the brand has had some competitive situations, but the trend line has been always up. And it's, as I say, a very resilient and powerful brand. I'm going to turn it over to Steve to talk about our current innovation.
Steven P. Cugine: Couldn't be more excited to talk about OxiClean's growth. We're going to take OxiClean into 3 major categories: the $7 billion laundry detergent category; the $1 billion auto dishwashing category; and the $800 million bleach category. So first, we'll turn our attention back to the dynamic laundry category. The #1 consumer frustration in laundry detergent performance is getting the tough stains out. Consumers want to be able to remove all types of stains the first time. So our answer is OxiClean Laundry Detergent. This great new product is specially formulated to lift out even tough dried-on stains the very first time, from blazing whites and brilliant brights at a meaningful value to the leading brand. Bruce will show you the advertising.
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. I'd like to talk about the advertising. And I think we have a demonstration that we wanted to show as well. [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: Thank you very much.
Steven P. Cugine: Thank you.
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. So as I begin to tell you a little bit about the advertising, I can't help but...
Anthony Sullivan: I am getting started here with introducing America's favorite stain fighter.
Bruce F. Fleming: Sully, I'm in the middle of the presentation.
Anthony Sullivan: OxiClean, powered by the air you breath and activated by the water you and I drink. Boy, am I excited to be out of the laundry room and in the boardroom. It's mother nature approved. Look at that. It makes your whites whiter and your brights brighter. And if you think that's good, I've got some big news for you that are here today, OxiClean is introducing OxiClean Laundry Detergent, 4x more powerful, it gets your whites whiter, your brights brighter, takes out grass stains, clay stains, ketchup stains, mustard stains. It will take the Chief Marketing Officer's stains out. It will even take Steve's stains out. Coming to you this year only from OxiClean. That's about all I got for you right now, Bruce.
Bruce F. Fleming: Sully, you're in for a triple. Could we show the real advertising right now, please? [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: We're very excited about this launch. And as you can see, Sully is as well. We're going to now talk about dishwashing.
Steven P. Cugine: All right. Thanks, Bruce. The second new category we're going to talk about is auto dish. When phosphates were removed from auto dish detergents, it created a situation where consumers became dissatisfied. Category performance declined and consumers could no longer get the cleaning performance they wanted. OxiClean, with a strong heritage of getting tough stains out, is coming to consumers' rescue to tackle the toughest dishwashing jobs. Today, nearly 7 in 10 consumers still experience significant problems with existing auto dish solutions. Dried-on foods that don't come off, filming on glasses and baked-on stains are the top issues. This is why we created our new OxiClean detergent, with cleaning so powerful it eliminates the toughest stains, stuck-on foods, cloudy films and odors for crystal clear and clean dishes every time. Over to Bruce.
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. I'm hoping I can get through this presentation, but I'm not entirely sure that I'll be able to with Sully upsetting it.
Anthony Sullivan: But wait, there's more. If your dishes are covered and are kind of clean, barely clean or are sort of clean, guess what you need. OxiClean Extreme Power Crystals. This is the glass done with the old stuff. This is the glass done with new OxiClean Extreme Power Crystals. You can get it in liquid or pack. It's coming to a grocery store near you. So don't do your dishes without using brand-new Extreme Power Crystals from OxiClean. We're not just taking over the laundry room. We're taking over the dishwasher as well. I'm pretty excited about this whole thing.
Bruce F. Fleming: Yes. All right. I wasn't sure this was a good idea. Okay, let's run the advertising. [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay, I think 74% of consumers who saw that ad said they'd definitely or probably would buy it, so it's very high rating. Again, very high persuasion scores, in the top 20% of the dishwashing database. Very excited about it. Talk about bleach now.
Steven P. Cugine: Yes, and it's an outstanding product. So moving to bleach alternatives. Chlorine bleach can make consumers worry. Many consumers want an alternative to bleach, with less risk of ruining their clothes and without the harsh smell. This is why we're introducing OxiClean White Revive. It powers out tough laundry stains and delivers bleach-like whitening to revive whites without the chlorine smell, yellowing or color damage. So your clothes look newer, longer. Bruce?
Anthony Sullivan: But wait, there's more! It's no secret that bleach can ruin your clothes. It will damage your socks, it will leave your socks yellow and dingy. We actually had to use coffee today from the boardroom to make sure it worked. If you've got ink stains on your shirts or [indiscernible], turn to the power of where is it, new OXICLEAN White Revive. It cleans like bleach without the damaging effects of chlorine. In fact, I'm so convinced that it's so good that I guarantee, Mr. Bruce Fleming, Steve Cugine, and even our CEO, Mr. Craigie, please show me how white your socks are, please, gentlemen? Powered by the air you breathe, and activated by the water you and I drink. This is probably the only time I'm ever going to do this, so I'm going to soak it in, OxiClean, the stain specialist. It gets the tough stains out, and it's not clean unless it's OxiClean. All right! Let's hear it one more time, it's not clean unless it's OxiClean.
Steven P. Cugine: Okay, all right, okay. He's just an obstreperous guy, I can't really say much about him. Human resources and legal, Jackie Brova and Patrick, can you please help me out here? I want to get through this presentation, thank you. Thank you, everybody. Okay, can we run the advertising now, please? [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: Yes, that's an important point. We're very fortunate we were able to get placement now of OxiClean in the bleach aisle, and I think it's going to be a positive win for both consumers and retailers. And 2014, across all our OxiClean variants, we can expect to see our advertising increase by 53%, and that's a pretty big number when you consider that we're the #2 laundry advertiser in the United States. It's what you do, what you have to do, when you're small, and what you have to do when you have a wonderful equity like OxiClean. Okay, I'm privileged to talk about our third mega brand, which is TROJAN. For 90 years, it's been known for trusted protection, and over the last 5 years, you've seen us introduce a lot more elements to the brand equity, especially those revolving around pleasure. So it's not only a product for protection, it's a product for enhancing people's sexual health and sexual lives. We've added products in that manner. We've also added communication that reinforces both those points. If you look over the last 5 years or so, there's been decent growth, but I believe we can do better, and that's why we’re introducing products into other segments. Steve's going to talk about innovation right now.
Steven P. Cugine: Thanks, Bruce. We did indeed experience strong success with the launch of our new TROJAN lubricants line in 2013. The insight behind this launch is that lubricants don't have to be about solving a problem, but can be all about making good sex great. As we develop the launch, every product package and communication decision was grounded in consumer research. And with the combination of a great concept, great packaging and outstanding product performance, TROJAN Lubricants was created. The result? TROJAN is helping make good sex even better. We introduced this line of lubricants in early 2013, and consumers love it. We achieved a 7.4% dollar share of the lubricants market in Q4 of 2013, and we're poised for more growth with the launch of 3 new items. 2 items in the premium tier and 1 item in the value tier, Arouses & Releases, lotion activated superintensifier that heightens the whole experience. Simply Pleasure, 2 simple preservative-free ingredients, providing long-lasting lubrication. We're also launching one new product in the large value segment of the category called TROJAN Explore, a gel lubricant that delivers excellent lubrication. Bruce, I'll turn it back to you for advertising.
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. So this year's tagline, TROJAN. Real. Good. Sex. I guess that's pretty simple. Clearly, it's been an evolution for us. We're going to continue to experiment with our communication, as I've said. And what we're trying to do is normalize the discussion about something that happens every day, and it's often about things people don't want to talk about, but we want to try to shape the discussion so it's in a positive manner. So what you're going to see, I'm going to show you the ad campaign across the 3 different products in our line. Some of you may really like it, some of you may say, it makes me uncomfortable, but that's exactly what we want to do. We want to be provocative, and that's what TROJAN will always try to do in order to build the business. Could you roll the tape, please? [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay, let me talk about our fourth mega brand, which is our Vitamin business. This has been a fantastic acquisition. It's been great to work on, great to understand. I think, when the day is done, sometime in the future, it's going to be a case study for incredibly wonderful success in building a category and building segments of the category. We bought this business, it's already been growing rapidly. The Li'l Critters business, parents grew up loving Li'l Critters and their kids loving Li'l Critters, because some vitamins are hard to take. And some vitamins are easy to take, and Li'l Critters and Vitafusion are easy to take. They had an insight into the gummy form, and within 10 years, became market leader in the kids segment. It's our job to make that success happen in the adult segment as well. All those parents, they grew up loving Li'l Critters for their kids. And since 2008, there's been some very wonderful growth. I mean, 31%, 32% compounded annual growth rate, you don't see this type of growth often. So when we had the opportunity to buy it, we jumped on it. I'd like to talk a little bit about packaging, because as a marketer you always have to tinker with the packaging. But in this case, there's a strategic intent here. When we bought the business, we saw that they had a trademarked tagline, they really had never used, which was, "We make Nutrition Taste Good." And it really was a unique -- its own proposition for these businesses. So how were we going to try, over the next couple of years, to link these businesses, the Li'l Critters and Vitafusion businesses, so that they can build upon one another? One way is in a very small way, but in a very prominent way, right on the package, every day when they open the jars and they recognize that this is just not something that they do routinely. They look forward to their vitamins because it tastes good. So Steve's now going to talk about the innovation that we have for this year.
Steven P. Cugine: Thanks, Bruce. We learned that 84% of adult vitamin mineral and supplement users take a multivitamin plus at least one other product. Our answer to this insight is the introduction of Vitafusion multiplus line of gummy vitamins. These great-tasting gummy multivitamins contain all the essential vitamins and minerals you need, plus extra nutrition at the level recommended by the Institute of Medicine to support specific health needs. We are also introducing this multiplus approach to kids' vitamins, as you can see here. Li'l Critters, Gummy Vites, plus additional benefits of bone support, immune support and omega-3 DHA support. Now back to you, Bruce, for the advertising.
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay, well we've got a great product, with great taste, and we just have to make people know about it, try it. Once they try it, we know they love it. So our targeting exercise here is really relatively easy. We've got an incredibly loyal amount of parents who have grown up with this brand over the last 10, 12 years. And now they're reaching the age where they need to think about their own health. In fact, they're not giving care to their kids, but they have to start giving care themselves, maybe getting care to their parents. So as caregivers, they start thinking of, "What else can I do, to make my life a better, healthier life?" And Vitafusion should be the answer, if we do our job well. I'd like to show the advertising. Could you roll the advertising, please? [Presentation]
Bruce F. Fleming: Okay. So as you can see, we're beginning to try to tie the businesses together in a way that makes sense logically, and can hopefully build upon one another. They're great products, which we're convinced that if we get the adults, who have cared for their kids to use it, that it would be successful. Here's an opportunity for adults to love the product for their own good health, for the same reason they love the product for their kids' health. Nothing fancy about that advertising, very straightforward, very database, but tested very well, and we know that's it's communicating -- it's communicating well. And as a result, we're putting our money where our mouth is. As Jim has told you about your focus, our focus has been relentless. We're going to spend more than 37% -- 37% more on our vitamin advertising to drive that growth, which is already extraordinary. Go ahead, Steve.
Steven P. Cugine: So for 2014, we couldn't be more excited about our portfolio of innovation. We have, for the first time, major news and new products in each one of our 4 mega brand categories: ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, TROJAN and Vitamins. However, we don't have time here to go through all of our new products, but rest assured that we have great new news on Nair, FIRST RESPONSE and Orajel and XTRA. We're very excited today, as we have this analyst call to talk about how much our retailers appreciate and love our new products, and they voted with their feet. We have strong trade acceptance of all of our product items for 2014. So, in summary, I think you could see why we believe that Church & Dwight has built a corporate competency for new product innovation. The new product innovation has been and will continue to be a critical driver of our organic growth. Innovation supports our mega brands growth drivers. 2014 represents the most significant portfolio of new products in the company's history. This portfolio of exciting new products represents platforms for growth and innovation that will extend multiple years into the future. With that, I turn it over to Matt.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Okay. You couldn't have sat through that presentation and not feel like there's something different about this year for Church & Dwight. So right, the numbers. Okay. So let's start with the 2014 outlook. So 3% to 4% is a very familiar target for us, so for top line organic growth. That excludes acquisitions, it excludes foreign currency. Gross margin, you see is flattish. As you heard Jim say, we do have a robust continuous improvement program called Good to Great. That's functioning well within the company. So absent the sliding that we talked about in the release, we would expect gross margin to have been up in 2014. Marketing is going to be flat, so it's going to be around 12.5%. That's where we ended 2013. We're expecting a lot of leverage from SG&A, and you see the operating margin up 80 basis points. Now between operating margin and EPS, you got taxes, interest, JV and others. So taxes, tax rate is expected to be higher, 2014, 34.5%. So that's a bit of a drag. On the other hand, the interest is going to be flat, but the JV income and other, expected to be up year-over-year, so that's all kind of baked into that range of $2.96 to $3.07. And as a result of raising the dividend, you can see we're at a 1.9% yield approximately right now. Okay, here's the history for organic sales, 3% to 4% is what we're targeting for 2014. And you can see we have 2% for '13, not necessarily happy with that result, and you can see innovation is going to drive the return to 3% to 4% in 2014. Here's the range, it's $2.96 to $3.07. And just -- I want to spend a minute or 2 on that. You saw in the release that we have $12 million year-over-year investment in slotting, so that alone is a 2% drag on EPS. Second thing is we talk about currency, we're different than lots other CPG companies. We're more U.S. centric, but we do have a drag and a bigger drag in '14 versus '13. So that's about a 1.5% drag on our EPS. So those 2 are both baked in there. And then you can see at the bottom of the slide, I don't know if you can read it, the range is influenced by retail distribution and a consumer acceptance of the new products. So retailers are jazzed about the new products, but what's unclear, obviously, is going to be the planograms and then of course, consumer acceptance. So that's going to be the wildcard and that's going to come clear as we move through the first quarter, and by the time we talk to you at the end of the first quarter. Okay, 11% increase in dividends we announced today, and just going to wrap on what we heard. So we had a solid fourth quarter. We're at 13 consecutive year of double digit growth. The Avid acquisition is just raging. We were up 20% net sales in 2013, and we expect double digit growth again in 2014. Playing to win, as Jim said, we've got an aggressive but achievable plan, and we have our largest new product pipeline ever. And as opposed to the past, we talked about the power brands a lot, and you're going to hear us talking about the 4 mega brands now going forward. And like I said, we're off to a good start with the retailers. We'll find out more about planograms as we move through the quarter. And we have a lot of firepower, as we described earlier, generating lots and lots of cash, and we're always on the hunt for new acquisitions. And with that, we'll take your questions.
James R. Craigie: So back here, so let me just recap myself, right, see all these hands to the crowd. We could have easily folded the tent this year. We could have -- we had a lot of headwinds, more competition than we've ever seen in the past, the categories and the economy are still sluggish. Foreign exchange has popped it's ugly head up in the past month or 2. We could've easily walked up here and said, hey we're going to fold back, but we didn't. We came out with the greatest product launches of history. We're still holding to a 6% to 10% range on EPS. We can tighten that range and we can do more. We just need to know more right now about actual shelving out there by retailers, what the competition's doing, what pricing is, merchandising, consumer acceptance on that. So give us a couple months to kind of understand all those facts. We don't have that right now, with all of these new product launches going out there. So we're very excited, very excited about this, and it's taking a full assault out there. So all right, questions? Bill?
Unknown Analyst: It's to Matt, what -- would be [ph] quick to share count for 2014 is? And then 2, Jim, can you tell us a little bit more about the decision to move from -- sorry. First question was, share count for 2014. Second is, maybe a little bit more, decision on to move from 8 power brands to mega and power? And when I say that, like, what does it mean internally? Does it mean you're going to pull back on advertising and R&D and stuff on like some of the other power brands, or the remaining power brands? And structurally, how should we look at it going forward? Should we expect faster growth out of the mega brands versus -- how should we think about that?
James R. Craigie: Let me deal with the mega brand question first. We are driven by share of voice versus share of market. We always look at -- no matter what you spend, it all depends. We're just kind of relative to competition. So as you look out there, the power brands that are staying as power brands and mega brands, we sold a very strong share of voice going into 2014 to support the new product. We have it. It's on the table here in front of you. But Steve and Bruce want to spend their time appropriately on mega brands. So we have great new products there and with the marketing spending we're doing on those brands, we expect, it will still drive good share growth gains there. The mega brand thing is just purely a very smart move. It's a very good, efficient move. How to best spend their money. Out there, we'll get a bigger bang for the buck for the money in all aspects. The marketing will drive more share growth that if we spend on the smaller brand. The organizational costs are less. So it's just again, it's not a revolution. It's an evolution of our strategy, it makes total sense. I think you see some of our big competitors out there, I mean Colgate's a great mega brands around the world as well. We see these 4 brands as the key driver of our future. Not the total, the key driver. The other power brands we have, we're spending the appropriate amount of money, we're doing the appropriate amount of new products to keep -- they'll keep delivering that. So we feel very good about that. This is a tweak of our strategy that's very smart, to drive good strong growth going forward. Matt, on the share?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, I'm going to disappoint you, Bill, with respect to the share count. So this flexibility in the amount of the shares and the timing, which we would actually buy shares back. This year, we haven't bought any shares so far, for the first month of the year, but we do intend to buy some, but it is a multi-year program. So we'll update everybody when we -- end of the first quarter.
Unknown Analyst: But is it -- any EPS guidance?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: There's a range. Connie [ph]?
Unknown Analyst: A couple of questions. First for Matt, on the fourth quarter. Could you discuss the dynamics -- sorry, could you discuss the dynamics of the household products business? Because it looks as though price mix was much more negative in Q4 than Q3. So I guess, I want to know like what's going on in the business? Were you selling out older inventory to ship in new products? So if you would discuss that along with the shelf space gains you're expecting or have got commitments from retail for the new products?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, when -- at midpoint of the year, you may recall we had a 3% to 4% target for full year, and we took it down to 2%. And when we did that, we made plans to put a lot more trade promotion out in the second half. So that was in a knee-jerk in the fourth quarter, something we made the decision in the middle of the year. So if you went back and looked at the first couple of quarters, you'd see that, actually, the price mix is pretty tepid in Q1 and Q2, and was big in Q3 and Q4, and that's because we were disadvantaged on shelf, particularly in the litter category, and we had to correct that in the second half.
James R. Craigie: Connie, too, there's been tremendous pricing in the laundry category. We're not leading it. A couple of our competitors have pulled down their promotion prices, and so we've had to deal with that. So it did hurt the gross margin a bit. We're not going to start a price war, but we're not going to be left uncompetitive. So we did have to spend more on the promotional side in laundry, to stay competitive in the category. We'll still drive share growth. ARM & HAMMER liquid, it's just had its 16th consecutive quarter of share growth, 4 years of share growth. So we didn't want competitors who, some of them had nothing but price to deal with right now. They don't have innovations and they tried to pull the price lever and we made sure we were not on a price -- uncompetitive. So it did cost us some gross margin on the back half of the year. Alice? Alice, waiting for the monitor?
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: So in the -- your guidance for the first quarter for 1% organic sales growth, what in that is volume and price mix? Because I'm assuming volume's up quite a bit in there. And then for the year, could you break that out as well? And then I have a question about pricing.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, if you look at that -- we saw, what was the fourth quarter, we saw about a 5% volume and about 3% negative price mix. You expect to see something like that in the first quarter, it's #1. Number 2, it's 1% organic growth, is what you saw in the release for Q1. There's a 200 basis points drag from trade, coupons and slotting, in that number. So you've got a big boat anchor around the top line number. And if you look at the gross margin, which is, we were projecting it to be down 100 basis points, it's more -- there is more than 100 basis points of hurt from the 3 items I just mentioned, slotting, trade and coupons. So -- and you would expect that, and when you -- with all innovation that we talked about today, you would expect it to be a big investment in the front half of the year, and that's why, I mean and some people wrote that we have it back in a year from an EPS standpoint, not at all concerned about that, because we're putting investment up front.
James R. Craigie: Alice, we'll only get a partial quarter benefit of volume from the new products that is beginning to ship, so we take the full shot on slotting in the first quarter, so that's what Matt's saying that's having a drag on the organic number. But the second quarter, we'll have the full benefit of a quarter's worth of volume from that, and actually a reversal. You only have a slighter drag in the second quarter from continued slotting for the accounts that are later getting out there. Your second question, and then I'll ask Mr. Schmitz.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. So you gave some indication of the price on the shelf of the new OxiClean detergent? I think you said, it could be about a 20% discount to what I guess is Tide. If -- could you give us that, the price of OxiClean detergent on the per-wash basis versus basic Tide? Because Tide has a huge range of prices, so is it going to be priced at a discount to basic Tide, on a price per-wash basis? That's my question.
James R. Craigie: It's a tough one. Our objective on OxiClean detergent is to offer the performance of the leading brand at about a 20% discount. And again, you're right. They have different forms. And in the end, we don't control pricing. The trade mix makes the pricing decisions. Procter has announced a kind of an implicit price increase. They've taken ounces out of their Tide line, and held the price, so that's going out also in the marketplace. So right now, and that's all just beginning to happen on shelf. So I honestly can't give you, at this point in time, an exact price per load answer like that. We need to see what happens on the shelf and how the retailers price the product and what happens. So -- but our goal was to be about a 20% lower on price, but equal performance, so that's kind of the target. That's what Church & Dwight is all about, great performance at a great value. So we think we have a great new laundry detergent. We want a piece of that premium tier, so offering that great performance but at a better value.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And where are you going to see it on the shelf? When are we going to see it on the shelf?
James R. Craigie: Literally, probably late February, early March out there. So it's going to be happening soon. Bill Schmitz?
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Do you think the laundry category will grow in 2014? Because the crazy price you've seen in the last couple of months, all it's done is shrunk the category, right? So price mix is down and volume is still down.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, it's a tough question, Bill. Because the category is starting to show little improvement. It was as bad as 4% down in the first half of 2013. It was down about 2.5% down in the back half of 2013, the fourth quarter. There's pluses and minuses going on. I think the launch of OxiClean could be a plus in the category, more of a premium price. You can probably assume that Tide simply will pull pricing down, because as Tide users switch, and I think I heard Procter say they thought as much as 40% of the users of Tide simply would come from base Tide. Well, that's about a 40% price decline from the base, so that will be a drag on the category. But honest, we don't know yet. I -- it's a very -- it's one of those questions -- I've said it before, where's the source of volume for the brands, what happens to the category. We're trying to grow the category, we're trying to bring innovation to the category, both with ARM & HAMMER and especially innovation on OxiClean out there and that, so. We're trying to grow the category, and we're not the ones driving the price down, so we want to see that category grow again. So that will be good for everybody, good for the retailers and good for us.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And I'll just follow up on the advertising spending. Obviously, when you have a hit, your net sales from your gross sales, the denominator, right, is lower? So your advertising ratio should come up anyway? And then you look at the back half of the year, is there enough flexibility in the earnings? Because you have these great launches coming out, and you're spending all this sliding, all this trade money, but you're going to have to support it, obviously, right, once they're going to get shelf space. So I thought it was a little bit odd that you said the ratio was going to be flat for the full year.
James R. Craigie: Well, the ratio was about flat for the year, but we're going to have our revenues going up, so the amount of money will go up. But probably the reason we're leaving a range too on the 6% to 10% is to leave us for some flexibility on marketing spending. For good news or bad news, if we see some of these businesses take off, we're going to put more marketing money behind them. If we see some competitive actions, we have to put some more to defend our businesses. So part of it again, there's a lot going on out there in the category, across all categories, leaving ourselves a little room to wiggle right now until we see more of the whites of the eyes of competition, what the trade does on that, so it's part of the reason why this year, last year, we called 14%, boom. From day 1, we delivered 14%, boom. Because we knew what our competition was doing. We had more stability out there in the marketplace. And now this year, a lot of things are up in the air going around, so we need a little room right now, especially with the greatest product launches we've ever done in our history with that, so. Stay tuned, we'll try to refine things a little bit more. As we get into the year, we see what's actually happening. But this point in time, we just need to have more of a range than we have in the past. Yes, sir?
Unknown Analyst: So a couple of things. With the mega brands now then, sort of having the amount of new products, it seems as though this year relative to prior years, it really hits earlier in the year, in aggregate. Is that a fair way to characterize it?
James R. Craigie: No, there's just more. It's just more. We've never launched this many new products in the year to start with, so it's just the magnitude of the number of launches we're doing versus past years, that's it. It's not earlier, it's just more.
Unknown Analyst: And secondly, so now with the greater focus there and the timeline that you set out, as far as the new product innovation, would it be reasonable to assume -- and actually let me take a step back. One of the other things we mentioned was the use of money-back guarantees on some of the products. I just wondering if you can take us through. There seems to be a lot of confidence in these products, but it seems to be something relatively new for you as a company, so I wanted to get some thoughts on that.
James R. Craigie: No, we've got a quite a lot of experience on that. We've had guarantees on our product in the past, so we have a good history on what the redemption rates on that are. We feel very comfortable with that, and we feel very comfortable about how great our products are. So that's -- we're not concerned about that. That's just really putting your money where your mouth is. And I love this part. If you're a cat lover, you've got to try this cat litter. It is by far the best I've heard. I've given samples out to friends, and they had to -- they would tell me the truth, and it's unbelievable. The laundry detergent's the same way, unbelievable. So we feel very comfortable. I just -- we try to convey to consumers, try this. We're so confident, you will love this, we'll give you money back, and we've done that in the past with some brands. And we know what the redemption rates are, we feel very comfortable with that. Is that your whole question? Or was there a part?
Unknown Analyst: One last part. As far as the -- I noticed that a couple of the products, while you have some of the branding, particularly with ARM & HAMMER, sort of the yellow and what have you, a couple of products, Clump & Seal, and the I believe, sort of had the black, right? Is that more of a, sort of a call out to something, more premium? Or was there kind of a thought process?
James R. Craigie: That's exactly that. We -- the color black in packaging has conveyed premium in a lot of different categories out there, and we wanted these products to stand out in the shelf. So that's why we went that way. But you'll still see, it still has the famous ARM & HAMMER logo on it on that, so it still very identifiable as ARM & HAMMER, but these are premiums products out there, with premium performance, and we want it to stand out. We looked at both, honestly. It was very close. I'll tell you, the final testing was very close between the orange and the black colored packaging, and we decided in the end to go with the black, and we'll see. We'll have it [indiscernible] off, and I think it'll make these new products really stand out in the shelf, while still not losing the identity of the ARM & HAMMER brand on them. Right, back to this side?
Unknown Analyst: On the full year organic sales outlook, you adjusted it down just a tiny bit, at least at the midpoint. So can you talk about what changed in that, is it a function of increased promo or are there different expectations in terms of volume? And then just a follow-up on Vitamins, you had mentioned in your presentation that Vitamins were up 20% in 2013. But growth has slowed somewhat in the track channel. So first is, the track channel's indicative of what you guys are seeing across the board? And it looks like competition has picked up, so can you talk a little bit about vitamins, overall, in terms of the competitive side?
James R. Craigie: Okay, I think I heard the first part of that dealt with the 3% to 4%, while we have a range on that. And what could affect that range?
Unknown Analyst: Yes.
James R. Craigie: A lot of stuff. I mean, the categories to start with, I will tell you, our category growth assumptions overall next year, in total, across all of our 13 categories we're in, we're assuming that we're from flat to 1% growth. And I would assume that a category growth, so if that gets better or worse, that will do it. How well our new products do in the marketplace, we all think they will do great, maybe some will do greater than we think, some less. Competition, what's going to happen out there, pricing. So there's a lot more variability in the marketplace right now, and 3% to 4% to us is still pretty tight range. I think most of our competitors have a 2 or 3 point range on organic growth. So we feel pretty tight on that. Obviously, we hope can beat it, but I think that's, historically we've been in that kind of band overall, so we feel good. We talked about the vitamin category. Well, part of it's law of numbers as we get bigger, we had over 20% growth in business last year. A lot of that business is in unmeasured channels. Well over, I think, well Bruce, I think well over half of the business to us is unmeasured channels, through large customers, such as club stores and that. So part of the -- probably the Nielsen you see on that is not a true representation of what category growth is. I'll be honest, the category has taken a little hit just recently. You saw there was some negative press out there about the benefits of certain kind of vitamins, and the category has had a little hit. But I would tell you historically, we studied this very hard as we got in this business. That has its ups and downs. News comes out, good news, bad news and that, but overall, I think people are very smart. For what it cost you to take a vitamin, it's a very low cost, and there are people who don't believe in it, but I think most people believe. You can't lose in taking vitamins, especially as you get older. I could also sit here and tell you we studied hard the basis of those negative PR stuff came out there. And if you studied the group, the people they sampled, it was not representative of the overall population. But that's the problem with these studies. They come out on a [indiscernible] points of view, and -- but I don't want to get into that today. But the Vitamin category, with the aging population, the desire for greater health has been one of the best long-term growth categories out there. It goes through little blips, ups and down, but we feel great. The business is growing. Don't forget too on the adult side, only 3% of adults take a gummy vitamin. 97% of adults take, like a hard pill, so we have a -- and that's a $6 billion business out there, category. So we feel like we have tremendous runway on just -- even if the category's stayed flat, we've still got 97% of people out there taking a hard pill. And every time we -- give a chance, take the gummy versus the hard pill, they're blown away by the great taste difference on it, and that's what Bruce tried to show you in the advertising. So even our worst case, the category was flat, we saw tremendous runway on the adult side of the business, which today is bigger, bigger than the kid side of the business. The kid category is only 1/6 the size of the adult category, so with already half of all kids taking gummies. So that category is pretty well penetrated, and it's much smaller, the huge opportunities on the adult side with tremendous 97% of the business out there to be had, just convert people from pills to gummies, and we feel that's the huge runway in that business. That's why it's growing so quickly these days. All right?
Unknown Analyst: Matt, could you talk a little bit about the SG&A leverage, because what's implied in the guidance is -- that being -- you always do a good job on leveraging your SG&A dollars, but this is bigger than I think we've seen, ever, maybe?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. Well, you know that we make a big deal out about sales per employee, and overhead controls is a hallmark of Church & Dwight. And Jim had a slide, he had a few examples up there, of some things that are going on within the company. So for example, you saw a new health care program. We're probably one of the few large corporations that have moved to private exchanges immediately from 2014. A lot of people just kind of looking at it. We've always been very aggressive with respect with how we manage our health care costs. A couple of years ago, we went through a consumer-directed health care cost where the first $1,500 is paid for entirely by the company. So it would incent the employee not to actually get to the threshold. So you'd be more deliberate about how you spend your money. So information systems are up there, so the Avid business that we brought on, we went live mid-year on July for that entire business without a hitch, and we carried more people than we needed in the first half of the year and that kind of peeled off in the back, have a full year benefit next year. We also have a no headcount plan for 2014. So that 4,200 number you saw for headcount is what I'm looking for, for the end of 2014. And if you go back to last year, if you said, when I was up here, talking about 2013, we actually were calling at the time, a gross margin of flat. We turned out to be up 80 basis points, and then we spent 30 back on marketing. And at the time we were thinking, we're going to get the entire operating margin expansion from SG&A, we turned out, that we needed that. But this year, that's where the focus is, is on SG&A.
Unknown Analyst: Lots of exciting innovation here today. One thing that we haven't seen hos been liquid PODs. Unit dose appears like it's here to stay. The consumer, based on market share data, would suggest that they voted for liquid as the preference. So looking forward, do you think you have a material portfolio disadvantage without liquid PODs. And if so, what's preventing you from going down that path?
James R. Craigie: No, I would dispute your numbers. The POD category, unit dose, as we call it, has leveled off at about 9%. I would expect it to up go a little bit with launch of gains [ph], new POD product out there, but still probably end up around 10% to 11% of the category. We're a player in that. We're in a powder POD. We have seen no issue with consumers accepting the powder side of it. And the second -- and then it's so -- one thing, honestly we've been deficient at is, we don't have larger size packages of the POD. So you're going to see that from us next year. We have more than our fair share of the smaller size of the category. We don't have a larger size, so we're going to be launching more of that, but it is -- it's here to stay. It's found a niche out in the business place. It's again, 9% now, maybe 10% or 11% in 2014. Let's not forget, liquid is 75% of the laundry category, so we're going to be competitive in POD, so our focus is getting back and growing the liquids side of the category. Again, that's 3/4 of consumers want liquid. That's where we're going to put our focus in the business. So a good question, but I think we feel fine on that, and we're going to fix the deficiency we have on larger size PODs out there.
Unknown Analyst: Question. The $12 million increase in slotting fees, I thought slotting fees across retailers are coming down as there's traffic shifting to online and whatnot, so what's that $12 million getting you? Because I know you commented that you're not sure whether you get incremental shelf space or not for the new products.
James R. Craigie: It's literally an age-old thing. The -- still the predominant number of retailers demand a slotting fee to take on a new product, whether it sells more or less, that's -- their attitude is, that's your problem.
Unknown Analyst: Even if it's replacing something else in the line?
James R. Craigie: It could. That's where final shelving is one of the big things we don't know yet. We know -- I could show you a chart, I won't, but I could show you a chart, we've got great, very good acceptance, they want the product. Whether it takes the place of our product, where there's incremental shelving, is still to be determined out there. We feel good, but we don't know. We don't control that. And we -- the retailers are often dealing with new products from competitors and that, so -- the next step is what the shelving on the set. The set after that is how do consumers react to that all. So 2 big decisions to come, we literally -- again, because we don't control it, we've made very compelling cases, so they like the product, we feel very good that they've accepted all these new products. We don't know whether it's just going to be -- one in, one out as they say, or that we get incremental shelving from these things. We're still waiting to see it answered, and then bottom line, how the consumer reacts. Still to come.
Unknown Analyst: And then just, on the advertising, you talked about huge increases, percentage-wise for OxiClean and for Avid. I think those were the only 2 numbers you gave us. But overall, advertising is flat. So what -- where is it coming down? Which brands are pulling...
James R. Craigie: It goes back to my share of voice share market. We have shaved a few brands where we felt we were spending -- I'll give you one example, on TROJAN last year, we spent a tremendous amount of incremental advertising to launch Lubricant, and that was purposeful in that. So it was a major, massive launch into a new white space category. And so we're pulling back on that a little bit. We would have done that any way, so we're doing that, where we have major new news. We put bigger money behind those and we're able to do that while still maintaining a bigger share of voice in the market and our share of market in the condom side of the business, especially. So we feel confident. This is why, one thing about our company too -- Bruce Fleming controls all marketing spending of the company. It's not -- I grew up in another company. There were 12 divisions, all 12 divisions had their separate pots, and they wouldn't exchange money at all. Bruce will move money by the day, by the week. As he see things happening, whether good news, put more money behind it, or bad news, needs to be defended, or whatever. So he constantly watches that, he constantly pulls the money left and right between all different businesses we have out there, so we have the best bang for the buck. So that's my promise -- right now, we made a decision, as of this moment, where the brands go. As we see things happen in the marketplace, we'll make assessments on it, and shift money as appropriate. But we think, it all starts with share of voice, the share of market. We feel we have at least a strong -- and in many cases, in the mega brands, our share of voice will be 1.5x our share of market, and we believe you've got to be, kind of be at those levels, to grow your share. That's us through history, so we studied this intently, we don't want you to bore you with the details today, but we watch that very closely, that ratio. Jason?
Unknown Analyst: Can you talk about the growth of the personal care segment, excluding Avid, so how you saw -- there was a lot of innovation that came through in 2013. And obviously, you're talking a lot about 2014 as well. So I guess, it just seems that on the premium side of the equation, that's where, I think, a lot of people are still uncertain about the consumer that's out there. So can you just talk about how much reliance you need on that? Personal care -- is innovation really the work to kind of be, come within your implied guidance?
James R. Craigie: Yes, we feel good. I mean, we had a positive year of growth for TROJAN, as a total brand. We had a good year on, actually, toothpaste. We are one of the fastest-growing toothpaste businesses out there percentage-wise. We're still a small player, but our toothpaste business did very well. It was not a good year in NAIR, the weather really hurt the NAIR business, any kind of a seasonal business. So that business was a step back. And on the pregnancy kit business, we hit an all-time record share on FIRST RESPONSE this time. So overall, the personal care business is doing just fine. We're very happy with Avid, and then of course, we consider Vitamins more on that side of the equation too. And so, the personal care business is doing fine, with some little lumps on the road caused by seasonal activity. So that's why you didn't see. ARM & HAMMER Truly Radiant toothpaste, best toothpaste we've launched in a decade. We're launching a toothbrush along with it. That'll be big, and Nair's going to be a whole argan [ph] oil line coming out, which is very hot out there, very good trade acceptance on that so far. We didn't even talk about it. FIRST RESPONSE, we are just launching the first pregnancy kit that has a 6-day claim on it. We could tell you, 6 days before your missed period, if you're pregnant or not. Nobody else has 5 days. It took us over 3 years to get clearance on that through the FDA. We're the only one in the marketplace with that. Every time there's been a day improvement on that thing, the brand has had it. Has delivered tremendous growth. So again, we didn't even talk about that today, but it's the best new pregnancy kit out there that'll help that business, so a lot of great new news across it. I'll tell it to you, you can't, don't forget, one thing about OxiClean we love, the base powder business, it's a household business with personal care margins. The margins on base OxiClean are plus 60% on the business. So it's a category, it's a household category, and has personal care type margin structure to it. So -- brand, so you can't just categorize stuff. It's just household with "lower margins", personal care with higher margins. Even some of the household businesses have very large margins. But overall, feel good. But overall, feel good about the business. Joe [ph]?
Unknown Analyst: Just going back to marketing for a second, you mentioned that it's supposed to be up this year, in terms of dollars, but flat as a percentage of sales. And I know it's distorted a little bit by specialty. But given the move to the mega brands, is there a change to get more efficiency in that number actually trends down over time, in terms of a percentage of sales? And then secondly, in terms of gross margin, how much is left on Good to Great?
James R. Craigie: On the marketing side, we honestly, again flat on dollars, flat on percentage, up on dollars overall, with more, I think I said, 80-some percent of total marketing, what the slide said, on the mega brands. You could, Joe, fall into that argument that you could reduce spending over time but we don't see it. We want to just keep increasing our marketing. And I hope you're blown away by that chart today. Church & Dwight's the 13th biggest advertiser in the U.S., bigger than companies that you would never think spend less than we do on that. What's the other part of the question?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: The other question was, where is the end of the road for Good to Great? And in our company, there's no end to that road. So if you look at what happened in 2013, we had somewhat benign commodity inputs. And so the efforts of the Good to Great folks popped, right, at 80 basis points, so it's margin expansion. And the fact that we were able to hang on to our margin for the last wars is a tribute to the Good to Great program. Now, we can't depend on commodities being benign. In fact, we're expecting some moderate inflation in '14 versus '13, more than we saw at '13 versus '12, and it's also baked into our assumptions. But I would say, we always approach Good to Great over a 36-month period, and we can only de-bottleneck in a linear fashion. Once you de-bottleneck one thing, or you improve something, something else becomes the next target. So I wouldn't call out a number and say, okay, this is the maximum we can get to, so I wouldn't underestimate the talents of the people. Wouldn't try to gripe, but we approach it every year, we're going to try to expand gross margin.
James R. Craigie: Yes, I want to emphasize a point I mentioned too, 25% of all employees' bonus in Church & Dwight is based on the hitting the gross margin target. We studied incentive compensation structure. Of all of our competitors, nobody else has gross margin as the specific bonus target. We started that about 5, 6 years ago. It's been a key driver of our great results, so trust me, you have every employee in Church & Dwight focused on gross margin. It's as important a driver as the revenue. It's as important a driver of EPS. It's as important a driver of the cash flow. So that's what Matt said. It's an all-the-time focus on doing it, and people know. They can help us on gross margin. It generates better earnings, where we spend more on the marketing side. So I'll tell you, my marketing team, I think Bruce would agree with this, probably spend as much time working with operations on how to improve the gross margin as they do with their advertising agencies in how to improve the advertising, that's Steve's put on new products, because we made it, equally as important as that. And that's why we've had the great results I showed you on gross margin as part of our bonus structure. I'm actually amazed nobody else has it, because gross margin can drive a lot of opportunities in the company to be able to spend more money on marketing or drive more earnings on that. Other companies don't want to deal with it, but it's very, very -- we watch everything from trade promotion spending to how to cut cost in our products without degrading the quality, massive effort going on, 365 days a year. Next time, we're getting better acoustics in this room.
Unknown Analyst: Two quick questions. On the gross margin, is the innovation driving any of the flatness in gross margin? Are you innovating up the gross margin value chain or not?
James R. Craigie: Well, again, our policy overall is that new products must have a higher gross margin than the product it replaces, but as Matt said, you get all these products out. The slotting fees are offsetting some of that margin improvement in the products in that, so. And sometimes, there are startup costs on the new product which may pull the gross margin down short term. But long term, they'll have higher gross margins. So that's good news. Question two?
Unknown Analyst: And it just seems significant that you've had all these years of double digit earnings growth, and this is the year where you're not necessarily expecting that. That just seems like a big change.
James R. Craigie: Well, I'd still say, we're kind of late announcing our earnings versus everybody else. 6% to 10% in my eyes, still puts us in the top quartile of what people are promising in earnings. And we get the same issues they all do with currency out there, the economy and everything else there. So we feel very comfortable that relative to our competition, our goal is always to be in the top quartile of earnings performance. So we feel 6% to 10% still puts us in the top quartile, deal with the same issues they're dealing and then, having to support all the launches which we're doing in our eyes more product launches across our portfolio than everybody else. So we still feel they're very good, we're top quartile performance, and we did say 6% to 10%, so stay tuned.
Unknown Analyst: Okay so, but also, just thinking about '15 then, if you probably, this could be a peak innovation year, in terms of just the big -- the mega brand launches, do you think '15, all things being equal, would be back to double digit?
James R. Craigie: Well, we won't be able to top it as far as more launches, because we're launching every category this year. But don't forget, we'll only get about 3 quarters, maybe 50% of the year benefiting these new products. Next year, we get the full benefit of the new products. And one thing Steve Cugine's been charged with, we don't want just a 1-year wonder out of these products. He showed a chart earlier that 1/3 of our volume today is driven by the new products we launched the past 5 years. That's sticky factor. We want these products to stick, and to be able to build upon them going forward. So we get a full year benefit of all these product launches next year, without the hit of slotting fees that we put behind them out there. And we may launch different versions of these new products, as they stick and hit the ground. So the number of new products now, you couldn't possibly top what we're doing this year, in terms of number of new products, slotting fees should be less next year. And hopefully, we'll have a full year benefit of these new products going forward, because they are just awesome. They should really have some long-term stickiness and be able to grow share up in the marketplace.
Unknown Analyst: Could you please talk about the competitive intensity of the adult gummy vitamins versus other branded as well as private label? And then secondly, if people see a great advertising and want to buy your products online, what's the easiest way for them to get it?
James R. Craigie: Yes, the adult gummy category had certainly picked up with intensity. Products have been launched by major brands like One A Day and Centrum, but we welcome that. That's great news, because again remember my fact, only 3% of the adult category is gummies. 97% is hard pills. You see the guys who dominate the hard pill side, going to gummy, to me, it just tells adults, hey, gummies are great. As they come to gummies, we still feel we have the best tasting gummy product out there. I taste them myself all the time. The competitive product, some are brittle, like Skittles, some are not as chewy and sweet as ours. We really have some proprietary processing knowledge that I don't believe anybody else has, so. We're bringing people in. There's 97% of the business to be had. If there's more competition, it's only great to me, because it's just telling everybody, gummies are not a kiddie thing. They're for adults too, when you see the big brand names go out there and get into it. We do have manufacturing advantages. We're the only ones that make our own gummies. The other guys go through co-packers. So we have a lot more flexibility as to what we make, and to keep up with demand out there. And because we were first in the category, we have really strong relationships with the trade. They love us. They just love our products. We want to keep selling them. Our guys are doing a great job, coming out with new forms. I think this whole plus line, both the kids and adult side, is a very smart move. Because people, Steve said, the number was like -- 84% of people buy a multivitamin and then buy a supplemental vitamin for again, heart, bone, hair, skin and nails, we put them together. Now you just need to buy one product. And I'll tell you, it's not so easy to make a product that tastes great, and so it's the gummy form with some of the ingredients that are put into those, but our guys are just phenomenal. So it's a great testament, so -- but I welcome the competition. I really welcome the competition. I hope to sit here next year and say, the gummies' 10% of the category, because that means there's still 90% to go, but people are coming over. We're not happy until we see over half of all adult vitamins be in the gummy form, and we're still going to be a leader in that, so tremendous growth opportunity. Come on, way in the back.
Unknown Analyst: So on capital allocation, Matt, my first question is sort of why now, with the buyback, I guess, the balance sheet's in great shape, but it has been in the past, and you guys have generally been reluctant to pull the trigger on repurchasing the stock. Jim, for you, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on the M&A pipeline. That will be helpful. And then getting back to gummies for a moment, do you still think you can do double-digit growth this year, given some of the slowing that we're seeing in the data?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, on the buyback front, just recall, when we have $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, so that's probably our high watermark, for us. And as we continue to grow the amount of the free cash flow we generate annually, we have -- we need outlets for the cash, right? So there's a couple ways to go: dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. And being a BBB+ rated, we have access to the capital markets. The reason it's a $500 million program, is we had remaining $220 million on our existing program. So rather than have another small program, we extinguished that, and so let's have one $500 million, multi-year. And the Evergreen program that we announced, was in addition to that, that's simply to remove share creep. So last year, there were 1 million shares that were exercised, so you could expect about 1 million plus shares on an annual basis that we would be acquiring under the Evergreen program. The $500 million is there to reduce the total amount of shares outstanding, some of which we will do this year. We just haven't -- we haven't said anything about the timing or the amount.
James R. Craigie: And the gummy side, we definitely believe we can do double-digit growth. I mean we, over the course of 2013, we landed a lot of new distribution. That's one of the things in buying a company. This company's a very small company we bought. They didn't have our sales muscle out there, so our sales force has done a great job in getting the products that already had in better distribution, that we're launching a new plus line, I feel good. We're taking the advertising up 30-some percent. We promise you, we bought this business, it was only advertising about 6% of net revenue or 5% in advertising. We're now in the double digits on the advertising, having more than doubled the advertising spend in that category, so we feel good. Let me just end with one comment because you've been very patient and wonderful today. I'll just tell you, I mentioned earlier, about M&A market is very active on there today. You can't count on anything until the calorically challenged seller sings. So we're working hard on that, and -- but no promises, but it's more active than I've seen it in prior years, which is good news, and we have a lot money. We have a lot of dry powder out there, but we're very selective. We've always known if we find a great acquisition, we can grow it. We're not going to buy junk brands, old, dead brands that are not 1 or 2 in their category, but I'll just tell you we've been very, very active out there. But again, I can't promise anything. It's not built into our numbers, but the good news, is we have lots of dry powder. And also, we have the organizational time now. We're through the big absorption process of the gummy business. We're seeing a lot of focus to integrate into our systems, everything else. We're through that, and my team's hungry and ready for the next big acquisition. So let me -- if you have more questions, please give us a call later. Again, I thank you for your patience, and thank you, who came today. I thank you on the line who are listening. I can't tell you how I'm excited. I've been waiting for this day for 6 months, because I've been -- you've all been asking questions along the way, of what we're going to do, what we're going to do, and I just couldn't tell you, I didn't want to tip off the competition. Well, now, the cannon's been fired. We're going to have a great 2014. We're excited, and stay tuned. It will be great. Thank you, all.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce to you your host for today, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my overview on our third quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspectives on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start out by saying that I'm very proud of my team for delivering the excellent third quarter business results in such a difficult business environment. Despite headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures, the third quarter results reflect double-digit net sales growth of 11% versus year ago, an all-time company record for gross margin of 45.4%, which was 20 basis points above year ago. This is also the fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, an 8% increase in marketing spending versus year ago, with supported share growth on 7 of our 9 power brands, a 15% increase in operating income and an 80-basis-point increase in operating margin versus year ago, a 15% increase in earnings per share versus year ago, and a 75% increase in free cash flow versus year ago. In addition, I'm pleased to report that we have finished the integration of our most recent acquisition, the Avid Health gummy vitamin company, across every business function. The Avid acquisition continues to deliver outstanding results, with double-digit sales growth and better-than-expected cost synergies. So despite continued headwinds, the excellent results for the first 3 quarters of 2013 make us feel very confident in achieving our aggressive annual EPS growth target of a 14% increase versus year ago. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to give you more details on our third quarter results, and then I'll return to provide some further insights on the results of our key brands and provide additional details on my outlook for the year.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everybody. Third quarter EPS was $0.76 per share compared with $0.66 in 2012, as Jim said, up 15.2%. Our reported earnings were up 11% to $804.8 million. Organic sales was up 1.6%, which was slightly above the midpoint of our previously communicated expectations of a range of 1% to 2%. I'm now going to review the segments. The organic sales of the Consumer Domestic business increased by 0.8%, primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additives, TROJAN products and FIRST RESPONSE diagnostic kits. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, NAIR depilatories and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes. Volume growth contributed 4.5% to the increase in sales and, as expected, was partially offset by 3.7% unfavorable product mix and pricing. In contrast, price mix in Q2 was a negative 2%. So the result is consistent with our plans to remain price competitive in Q3 and also in Q4. International increased organic growth by 3.7% in Q3, due to higher sales in Canada, France, Mexico and the U.K. This increase of 3.7% was entirely driven by volume gains. For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales increased by 3.7%. This was a nice rebound from the weak second quarter. Volume increases drove a 7.9% increase in sales, partially offset by 4.2% unfavorable product mix and pricing. Turning now to gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 20-basis-point expansion from year ago. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the positive impact of productivity programs and is remarkable as we overcame considerable negative price mix in the third quarter. Year-over-year commodity costs were relatively neutral for the quarter, with a notable exception of resin, which, many of you know, is at a 3-year high right now. As a result of our Q3 gross margin performance and our expectation that Q4 will be the sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, we now expect gross margin for the full year 2013 to expand by approximately 75 basis points. With respect to marketing, year-over-year marketing spend increased 8% to $99.7 million or 12.4% of revenues, which is a 30-basis-point decline from the prior year spend rate. We continue to support new product launches and grew dollar share on 7 of our 9 power brands. This is due to great execution by our sales and marketing teams. For the full year, we expect marketing, as a percentage of sales, to increase approximately 25 basis points. SG&A year-over-year increased by $7.8 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting the inclusion of the Avid business. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was 12.1%, down 30 basis points from year ago in the quarter. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be about 13% of sales, and that would be 30-basis-points improvement from year ago. And we continue to focus on SG&A as a lever to drive future operating margin expansion. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20.8%, which was 80 basis points higher than last year's 20%. Income from affiliates was flat in the quarter year-over-year. Other expense was unfavorable year-over-year, primarily due to interest expense related to the Avid acquisition. And this holds true on a full year basis as well, as we expect a decrease of $14 million in other income on a full year basis, primarily related to interest expense. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.9% compared to last year's 35.7%. The full year effective tax rate, we now expect to be approximately 34%. A little bit of history on the tax rate. Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 34%. Q2 was 34.5%, so we're already trending lower with respect to our effective tax rate versus our 35% call for the year. With the 33.9% rate in Q3, it's pretty obvious now the full year will be closer to 34%. So we got a couple pennies of benefit in the first half versus our full year expectation. Cash flow. Turning now to cash, we generated $376.6 million of net cash from operations for the first 9 months of 2013. We have spent approximately $30 million year-to-date in CapEx, which is approximately $90 million decrease from a year ago, which included the construction of our California plant. We expect to spend approximately $70 million on full year CapEx. There were no share repurchases made in either the second quarter or the third quarter, and we have no plans for share purchases in the fourth quarter. That will leave us with approximately $220 million remaining on our share purchase authorization by year-end. Our cash balance right now is approximately $450 million, and we expect to end the year with a cash balance approaching $500 million and levered approximately 1.2x versus EBITDA. So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include 1.6% organic sales growth, it's the fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, and 15.2% earnings per share growth. We expect fourth quarter EPS of approximately $0.65 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. I'm going to turn it back to Jim right now.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I'll finish up the call today by adding a little color to our third quarter results, which Matt just took you through, and my outlook on the year. As stated earlier, those of you who've heard me speak before, know that I've been a long-term pessimist about the business environment. The latest forecast of weak GDP growth, continued high unemployment and weak same-store sales by major retailers provide little hope for significant near-term improvement in the U.S. economy. In fact, of the 14 categories in the U.S. that Church & Dwight operates in, 6 experienced lower category dollar sales in the third quarter versus the prior year. When a category is flat to down, it creates a much more intense competitive environment, as the only way to drive organic growth is to gain market share through higher marketing spending, new product innovations and/or aggressive pricing. All consumer packages companies are fighting these headwinds. But as I told you many times before, I believe no other consumer packages company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. There are 7 key factors to support that statement. First, we have a unique product portfolio within the CPG industry. It consists of both premium and value brands, which puts us in the position to thrive in any type of economy, as exemplified by our ability to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the last 12 consecutive years. In particular, our value brands, representing over 40% of our revenue base, have experienced strong growth in this recessionary economy as consumers are generally making smart choices by switching to and staying with our high-quality but lower-priced brands. A great example of this is our value-based Laundry Detergent business, which consists of 2 brands, ARM & HAMMER and XTRA. These brands fell for 1/2 to 2/3 less than premium price brands and delivering exceptional cleaning performance. Consumers love our value brand detergents, as proven by the fact that more U.S. households buy a value brand than premium or mid-priced laundry detergent brands. The great value delivered by our 2 brands have resulted in steady share growth. In the third quarter, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a record quarterly share of 10.1%, which was its 15th consecutive quarter share growth versus year ago, and has now clearly surpassed the all brand to become the #3 liquid laundry brand in America. ARM & HAMMER was 1 of only 2 major brands to deliver share growth in both the third quarter and the latest 52 weeks. Our other liquid laundry detergent brand called XTRA also achieved a record quarterly share in the third quarter. It is now the #2 liquid laundry detergent brand on a wash load basis, representing 1 out of 7 wash loads in America. As a result of the strong performance by both ARM & HAMMER and XTRA liquid laundry detergents, Church & Dwight was the only major manufacturer to grow total detergent dollar sales in the third quarter. The strong consistent share growth on both of these brands has enabled Church & Dwight to increase its liquid laundry detergent market share by 50% over the past 5 years and become the #2 laundry detergent company in America. The second factor, which is a key driver of Church & Dwight's success, is that we have a proven record of building share on our power brands. We have over 80 brands in total, but 8 of our brands are historic power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits. We have now added a nice power brand with the acquisition of the Avid gummy vitamin business. From 2008 through 2012, we grew market share on each of the 8 historic power brands in almost 75% of the quarters. In the third quarter of this year, we grew market share on 6 of our 8 historic power brands and 7 of our 9 power brands, including the gummy vitamin business. Three key factors drive these excellent results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to increase marketing support on our power brands. In the third quarter of 2013, we increased our marketing support by 8% or $7.5 million versus year ago. This increased marketing support was a key driver behind record quarterly shares achieved in ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, our FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kit business and our OXICLEAN laundry additive business. The second factor driving this growth of our power brands is our robust pipeline of new products. Over the past 4 years, new products delivered about 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We have launched innovative new products in almost every key category this year. A sample of these new products includes ARM & HAMMER's new Ultra Power laundry detergent, which provides consumers with a more concentrated liquid laundry detergent in a smaller bottle, which is easier to handle, more environmentally friendly and enables dosage control for lightly soiled or heavily soiled wash loads. This new product drove 70% of the total third quarter sales growth on ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry brand, which enabled the brand and our total business to achieve its 15th consecutive quarter of share growth. Other new products that have been launched in 2013 or late 2012 include: a new line of sexual lubricants under the TROJAN brand name; a new toothbrush under the ARM & HAMMER Tooth Tunes brand, which plays music by the One Direction boys band; a new single-dose cold sore treatment under the Orajel brand. More detailed information on all these innovative new products is on Church & Dwight's website. Part of the increased marketing spending behind these innovative new products is increased sampling. For example, we are driving awareness in trial of our new TROJAN lubricant line by providing samples in 4 million boxes of TROJAN condoms. And to drive awareness in trial of our great-tasting line of gummy vitamins, we are increasing in-store sampling by over 50% versus last year. In addition to the increased marketing spending on innovative new products, the other key driver of share growth on our power brands is increased distribution. As a result of the consistent strong share growth on our power brands over the past 5 years, the Church & Dwight sales force has worked closely with our retail partners to increase the shelf space of our brands to meet the increased consumer demand and minimize out of stocks. The distribution gains achieved to-date in 2013 across all brands has been the greatest of my 9-year tenure as CEO. The combined effect of the innovative new products, increased marketing spending and increased distribution, delivered share gains in 7 of our 9 power brands in the third quarter, which puts us in the position to deliver stronger organic growth in 2014, behind an incredible pipeline of innovative new products in our core business, continued strong growth of new Gummy Vitamin business and an improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business. Let me just wrap up at this point about my company's ability to grow our power brands with the following Q3 share results on our other power brands. OXICLEAN powdered laundry additive grew its category-leading share by 1.8 percentage points to a record quarterly share of 42.9%. It is now over 2x larger than its nearest competitor. TROJAN grew its leading position of the combined U.S. condom, vibrator and lubricant business by having great new products and increased marketing spending. For example, the new TROJAN lubricant line, which was launched in the second quarter, has already achieved a 7% share of the lubricant category. And our Condom business has an industry-leading 76% market share, driven by constant product innovations, which has resulted in TROJAN having all 10 of the top 10 selling condoms in the market. FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits achieved a record quarterly share of 31.8%, up 1.2 percentage points versus year ago. And it's been the #1 selling pregnancy test kit for 35 consecutive quarters. NAIR achieved share gains in the third quarter to maintain its share leadership position for the 36th consecutive quarter. And finally, our new Gummy Vitamin business had a terrific third quarter. Li'l Critters, our kids vitamin brand, grew its dollar share to maintain its position as the #1 kids gummy for the eighth consecutive quarter. Vitafusion, our adult vitamin brand, grew its share, driven by a 40% consumption growth. Vitafusion is the #1 adult gummy vitamin for the past 8 quarters, with 6 of the top 10 SKUs, and is the fastest-growing adult vitamin brand for the past 52 weeks. In total, Church & Dwight is the market leader in gummy vitamins, with a 37% share. The gummy vitamin category grew 27% in the third quarter versus year ago, which is 6x faster than the growth rate for the overall vitamin business consisting largely of hard pills. We believe that the gummy category should continue to deliver double-digit growth for the foreseeable future, as it only represents about 9% of the total vitamin business. In total, that's a pretty impressive scorecard for Q3 share results for our power brands. Now let me quickly run through the 5 other key drivers of Church & Dwight's success. Number three is that we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands, as evidenced by our ferocious defense of OXICLEAN when a large competitor entered the category several years ago. OXICLEAN not only deflected the impact of the attack on other competitors, but has now strengthened its leadership position through the record share levels achieved in the third quarter. OXICLEAN is now larger than the combined share of the #2, 3 and 4 competitors in the laundry additive category. The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our international business. While our international business represents only about 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered strong sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the past 5 years. The growth continued in the third quarter, with 3.7% organic growth, driven by excellent results in Canada, France, Mexico and the U.K. The international organic growth would've been even stronger, except for lower sales of our NAIR brand, which is impacted by the cooler-than-expected weather this summer in Europe. Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margins through cost-optimization programs, supply-chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher-margin new products. Driving improved gross margin is deeply ingrained in Church & Dwight's organization. We not only talk the talk, but we walk the walk. 25% of every Church & Dwight employee's annual bonus is based on achieving our gross margin improvement target. I am not aware of any other consumer packages company that explicitly has gross margin targets in their employee bonus programs. This deeply ingrained focus on gross margin has enabled Church & Dwight to expand gross margins by 1,450 basis points over the past 11 years. Headwinds from higher commodity costs stalled our gross margin improvement in 2010 and 2011, but we were able to overcome these headwinds by the middle of 2012 to deliver 2 consecutive quarters of 100-plus-basis-point gains in gross margin versus year ago in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. This momentum continues in the first half of 2013, with 110 point -- basis point increase in gross margin versus year ago in both the first and second quarters of this year. Despite the fact that we are now lapping the 100-plus-basis-point gross margin gain achieved in the third quarter of 2012, we still achieved a 20-basis-point improvement in the third quarter of 2013 to achieve a record quarterly gross margin of 45.4%. And as Matt and I mentioned earlier, the cost synergies from the integration of the gummy vitamins acquisition are exceeding expectations. So as a result, we expect to continue to deliver gross margin improvement versus year ago in the current fourth quarter. The sixth factor behind our continued success is our ability to reduce SG&A as a percent of net sales by tightly managing overhead costs and leveraging our strong organization via acquisitions. We reduced SG&A as a percent of net sales to 12.1% in the third quarter and expect to continue to reduce SG&A costs as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter. This should enable Church & Dwight to continue to have the highest revenue per employee of any major consumer packaged goods company. Finally, factor number seven is our strong record on free cash flow conversion. Like gross margin, free cash flow is another one of the company's key components on our annual bonus program for all employees. As a result of having every employee focused on and incentivized to deliver higher free cash flow, we have quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income averaged 122%, which was best in class in the consumer packaged goods industry. As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we delivered a strong increase in free cash flow in the third quarter. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet has enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain, including construction of more efficient new plants, and the acquisition of leading brands. All these factors give me great confidence about our ability to deliver our aggressive 2013 EPS target of $2.79, which is an increase of 14% over 2012 EPS. We believe we can deliver that aggressive EPS target despite continued headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures. Our confidence in delivering this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors. First, we believe we can continue to deliver the market share gains in our power brands. These share gains are expected to result from innovative new products, increased marketing spending and significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands that I've mentioned earlier. Second, we believe we can deliver gross margin expansion of approximately 75 basis points on our total business in 2013, including new Gummy Vitamin business. The higher projected gross margin should enable us to be price competitive and increase marketing spending versus year ago on our power brands to deliver the share gains. Unfortunately, these share gains cannot fully offset the weaker-than-expected category trends and the ongoing need to continue to aggressively compete on pricing in a few key categories. So we are now projecting organic sales growth of approximately 1.5% to 2% for the full year. While this outlook on organic growth is lower than our initial annual goal of 3% to 4%, the share gains we have achieved on the 7 of our 9 power brands should put us in a position to return to higher organic growth levels in 2014, behind a great new pipeline of innovative new products on our global Consumer business, continued strong growth in our new Gummy Vitamin business and an expected improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business. In conclusion, 2013 has been and continues to be another very challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your bets in the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and a management team that has a track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver consistently strong EPS growth. This ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Jim, could you just talk a little bit more about kind of the growth outlook next year? I'm just trying to understand -- I mean, obviously, you have the easy comps on the Specialty business and the Avid business in the mix. But are you expecting the categories to turn up -- I mean, because I would -- seem like you need some category growth to get overall growth for the company.
James R. Craigie: Bill, yes, I actually do, because I've kind of hinted at it, but I won't give you any details. We have the most incredible new product pipeline ever in our history coming next year. We've always found historically that innovations help drive category growth, and I think that will be a key driver of that next year going forward. So I'm very excited about that. I do think the economy is slightly turning here, but I think more importantly is the new product innovations that we're launching across a lot of key categories will be very, very impactful on the category growth next year.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Matt, just I won't even ask the acquisition question, but at what point is too much cash earning 0.1% on the balance sheet inefficient?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, I'm sure many people who know our story know that, if you went back to year 2000, we had one power brand, that was ARM & HAMMER. And since then, we've added 8 others. Today, we have 9, and that was through acquisitions. And we have proven that once we acquire businesses, we're able to grow their market share pretty rapidly. So with that as a core competency in the company, and, yes, you're right, it's a lot of cash that's building up on the balance sheet. The destinations for that are acquisitions; and number two would be buybacks. And we haven't been a company that's done a lot of buybacks historically. And as I pointed out on our call, we do have $220 million remaining on our authorization. But you're right, Bill, we have lots of cash, but we look at that as an advantage with which to go shopping for new businesses. And the Avid business, we've now owned for a year, we acquired it October 1, 2012. And we've done a great job integrating that business, so we are in good shape right now to take on another one.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: But in terms of just share repurchases or even debt pay-down, there's nothing really you can do on the debt side for the foreseeable future?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: No, the debt side, you're right. We have some commercial paper out there. The reason we have commercial paper out there, while, at the same time, we have cash, is to keep our name in the market such that when we do, do an acquisition, we can avail ourselves of the CP market and keep our name out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wanted to talk a little bit about the promotional environment. And, Jim, can you talk about what you're seeing from a -- let's say, a channel shift standpoint in terms of consumers trading down by channel versus what you're seeing in terms of just a more aggressive promotional standpoint from the companies themselves? And then is there any particular price point -- you guys have lots of different products at all sorts of different price points. Is it more competitive at the lower end, at the high end? Just some sort of comments on that.
James R. Craigie: Yes, John. I really haven't seen anything new in channel shift. There's just the general trends going on over time. That's not really an issue right now. The competitive pricing situation is only occurring in a few key categories right now. Laundry is certainly one of them. We're seeing a bit of pricing pressure in there. But honestly, things have reached a point where I don't think they're going to go any lower. So I think that, that will stabilize itself, and I think you're going to see a lot of innovations in that category next year, so I think that'll actually help drive the category growth back up. So in general, it's been a little bit of a rough time lately, but I think things will definitely improve next year. As I think all competitors will go back to focus more on innovations to drive categories, and I don't think the channel shifting is any more of an issue than it's been in the past.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then a follow-up on your comments on laundry. I mean, we have seen, as you mentioned, a huge shift out of the middle of the category, right? So the high end with Tide has gained a little bit of share, but you guys have really gained a ton. How much more share is there available from the middle to your brands there? It's been a big move over the last 4 or 5 years, but there's still a lot in that middle. How much more do you think you can get?
James R. Craigie: A lot. A lot. The middle has been the section that's been kind of eroding for the past decade. There's still quite a bit of share left there. And I think consumers will continue to shift one way or the other to the premium side or to the value side because the middle, you can get the quality of those products with the premium brands, and the value side offers great quality at a great price. So it's been the share donor for a long time, and I think it will continue to be the share donor.
Operator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Want to talk a little about marketing spend. First, was there a shift from Q3 into Q4? Because if I remember correctly, you guys thought that Q3 would be up. And then how do we think about the spend in marketing versus promotion for 2014?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Olivia. Marketing spending was only lower as a percent of net revenue in the third quarter. We actually spent, on an absolute dollar basis, an additional $7.5 million. And we always assess what we're spending. More importantly, is how we're doing on share growth. And we had a great quarter in the third quarter. We grew share in 7 of our 9 power brands. So we always watch what's going on there. We just -- we always have our hand on the lever because we have to watch competition. I'll remind everybody that Procter & Gamble's announced that they're going to cut over $1 billion of marketing spending going forward. So we watch that. We always stay competitive. But most importantly, what we always gauge our marketing spending against is how we're doing on our share growth. And growing share in 7 of our 9 power brands is a great, great result.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And on the promo versus marketing?
James R. Craigie: Well, no, we always -- that's something where we always -- again, it's -- we consider that all part of marketing, whether it's advertising, consumer coupons or price promotions at the stores. And one of the great jobs of our marketing and sales team is always to gauge how to take the total pot of money we have and most effectively and efficiently deploy it in the marketplace. And I would say we're pretty good masters of that, given our share trends over time. So it's category by category, customer by customer out there, and we just -- we -- one thing about being a small company, and from me on down, we watch that everyday, and we'll shift the levers as needed to, again, most effectively drive the best share results and the best sales results. So we're pretty good against that. It just changes all the time, and that's why we have people in charge of the business and on top of it everyday.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the organic sales growth target of 3% to 4% for next year. How do you think about the mix between volume versus price for next year, particularly considering the big looming February 2014 launch in laundry?
James R. Craigie: Go ahead, Matt.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, as far as the 3% to 4%, historically, the company has been dependent upon volume growth as opposed to price mix. I think it's too early to actually call or split that number between how much is going to be volume and how much is going to be price mix. But suffice to say that if, in fact, the current environment continues, it's possible that it can be some price mix negative. It's certainly in the first half of the year, but we'll update that on the first week of February, when we give our 2014 outlook.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: I'd like to explore the vitamin category in a little more detail, if possible. Just from what you've seen so far during your ownership, if you could update on any positive, negative surprises. The shelf space often looks like a big mess when you go into any of the stores, really, depending -- no matter what the format is, a lot of private label. And so just a little more in-depth look at how you see the next few years progressing.
James R. Craigie: Caroline, this category and this business has been everything we dreamed of and then some. As I gave you some numbers before, the gummy side of the business continues to deliver very strong double-digit growth, particularly on the adult side. When we bought the business, the adult category of gummies was only about 3% of the business. So now that's growing rapidly. But still, in total, as I've said, gummy as a part of the total vitamin business, is only about 9% of the total business. So as far as we're concerned, there is 91% of the business to go. The gummy form has such huge advantages, and the taste and all the mouth-feel benefits of it. And I have yet to meet a consumer out there who hasn't tried a gummy, who said [ph] to me, that's the last time they're going to take a hard pill. So we love the business. We're doing a great job of driving distribution gains out there. We've done a great job of driving the cost synergies. We got a lot of new products coming. And the shelves, it's funny you say about the shelves, we kind of share your opinion that the shelves could use some better management out there. Retailers tend to think the shelves are okay. They tend to segment stuff between kids and adults and gummies and this or that and letter vitamins versus multivitamins and that. But we are doing a lot of work to try to help figure it out with the retailers and to try to make it more consumer friendly. But it's a great -- as you know, vitamins, overall, is a great growing category, given the health trends and aging trends not only in our country but around the world. So we are just absolutely thrilled that we bought into this business and bought the hot growing part of this business, so we just see great things going forward.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: And just so I understand, given how much private label there is, and a lot of the retailers have strong brand names, that doesn't keep price pressures on you guys? I mean, what's the price mix outlook like?
James R. Craigie: Price mix is -- yes, we have private labels in this category more than others. But we've been able to -- it was part of -- we had a small part of the business we bought that was private label. We've been able to keep it at that range. And I would say, our -- if you look at our product, our product itself has got a fairly decent value positioning in the category, so we feel fine about that. And like any other category, innovations will help drive the category. And certainly, you got a form here, the gummy form versus hard pills. So price pressures are really not a key issue in this category right now.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: And then separately, could you say what drove the improvement in Specialty and how sustainable that might be?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: It's pretty simple. The second quarter, you may recall, the weather in the United States was so cool such that the demand for our products completely fell off. The reason for that is, just to remind everybody, our product replaces electrolytes in cows. When it's really hot, cows lose electrolytes through sweat, and they don't make milk. So in the second quarter it was cool, so we -- demand fell off tremendously in our Animal Nutrition business, but that recovered in the third quarter. So it wasn't so much what we did, it was sort of business as usual in Q3.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Got it. And then just -- sorry, back to vitamins for a second, do you see this as both a double-digit top line opportunity, as well as bottom line opportunity?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: We -- it's a double-digit top line growth expectation for 2014, for sure.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: And bottom line?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: We don't call the P&Ls for the brands or products. We just only comment on top line growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So, Jim, first, on the slight guide down for the year in organic growth, and I know it's modest, but what's worse? And I know that laundry declined sequentially versus 2Q. Is there anything else specifically that you'd call out other than laundry?
James R. Craigie: No, Kevin, laundry is the key call, but we saw this coming. As it kind of started in Q3 and as we expect some continued pressures in Q4, I can't call the future. We'll do whatever we have to do to stay price-competitive. But that was all we see right now. There's -- yes, and everything else is minor at this point in time, but it's -- that's largely it.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then you provided guidance now for '13. It looks like it only implies about 1.5% organic growth, which I thought you'd get from Avid alone. So is it fair to say you expect the base business to be flat. Is that fair?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: No, we -- Kevin, it's -- to make judgments about the base business is way premature with respect to 2014.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: No, I'm sorry, Matt, I should have been more clear. This is with respect to 4Q, and your guidance now implies about 1.5% organic growth in 4Q, which I thought you get from Avid now in the base.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, yes, here's another way to think about it. So when we were on the call for -- at the end of the second quarter in August, we said we anticipated pricing pressures in the base business, and they certainly materialized. You saw that in the third quarter with the huge price mix. And although we expect market share gains in Q4, they'll generally be in categories that we expect to be flat or down sequentially compared to Q3. So yes, Q4 on a reported basis for organic is going to be similar to Q3, only this time vitamins is the big driver. So when we said a full year range of 1.5% to 2%, that translates into a pretty big range for the fourth quarter. It'd be more like a 1% to 2.5% range for the fourth quarter to get to a full year range of 1.5% to 2%. So that question is, okay, what's that range dependent upon? It's really a couple things. It's the success of our year-end promotions and our advertising across all categories including vitamins. The second thing is the severity of competitors' price actions. Anybody spending any time in the supermarkets right now has seen that there's tremendous amount of prices being slashed across the board. So yes, it's -- we got a pretty wide range in the fourth quarter, which drives the 1.5% to 2% for the year. But it's those 2 factors, right, it's our year-end promotions and advertising across all the categories and what -- how well would the competitors' pricing actions blunt our actions in the fourth quarter.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, Jim, speaking with laundry, 2 interesting data points I've picked up from conversations with the folks in the industry. I don't know if you can comment or not or care to, but, first, that you guys are planning on a new product launch with OXI into the premium tier of liquid laundry; and second, that 5 key retailers have indicated they're not going to pick up Procter's new mid-tier-type products, given that the category continues to be in rough shape and that it kind of leaves open the possibility that more dollars come out with the potential for further consumer trade-down. Can you comment on either one of those?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Kevin, I can. But let me just comment that we're fully aware of the launch of the competitive product by Procter & Gamble. I just remind everyone that one of our key success drivers that I've talked about earlier is our ability to successfully defend our brands, as we've done for several years, and as we did when Tide attacked OXICLEAN a few years ago. And for competitive reasons, we're not going to reveal the details of what I would call a ferocious defense that we're going to mount next year. But I also remind everybody, as it often happens in battles like this, it's the weaker players in the categories that are usually the losers, and that's exactly what happened when OXICLEAN was attacked by Tide. Tide has gained some share, but OXICLEAN also gained share, and the share gains that both those brands achieved came out of the weaker brands. So I think that's kind of the forecast I see for next year, but I don't want to reveal what we're going to do, and it's just going to be -- just trust us that we have a long history and a good track record of defending our brands, and we look forward to a good battle.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The CapEx budgets, so it seems like you spent $30 million year-to-date, and there's like a $40 million expected investment in the fourth quarter. What's the big step-up for?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, it's not so much a big step-up, Bill, as timing. We entered the year, we thought we were going to spend an excess of $80 million. And we've only gotten through $30 million of it through the first 3 quarters of the year. So if you've ever worked in a manufacturing organization, you sort of use it or lose it, right? So you got a lot of guys trying to get their projects get completed in the fourth quarter. So it's no one large project we can point to. It's lots and lots of little ones across all the plants.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got you. But would be surprised if it came in below $70 million?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: No, I think it'll be -- I think $70 million is about right. Because remember -- if you remember in August, Bill, we were calling $80 million, so now we knocked it down to $70 million.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. I just thought $40 million, I mean, it seems like a lot of money to spend in 3 months.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, it is.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then what's the end game in laundry here? Because like you look at some of the price per unit numbers from Nielsen and like guys are taking like 10%, 11%, 8% price decreases. And then obviously, you have to follow there. So like how does this whole thing end? Because volume is not improving. It's actually -- just continues to be flat.
James R. Craigie: Bill, I personally think 2013 is a year more of pricing pressures and things like that. I think 2014 is going to be a year of innovation. And I think forward, I think consumers will respond to that and look at the innovations that are going to come out across the category. And I think things will get better. I think it will. Just there wasn't that much in the pipeline from a lot of us this year as far as really, truly innovative product. I think you will see more of that next year.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got you. And your competitors, I mean, what are they telling the trade when they take like an 8% or 9% price decrease? And then why would the trade want to accept that if it's just going to shrink the category because the volume is not responding?
James R. Craigie: That's a good question, Bill. I think you should ask the retailers that.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: All right. And then in cat litter, shares are still a bit soft. It seems like you guys are starting a price war there at least in the last couple months. I mean, what's the turnaround plan there?
James R. Craigie: Bring new product innovations.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. But in the short term, is there going to be like a pretty aggressive pricing environment?
James R. Craigie: No, no, no. Bill, I would tell you, we've never tried to start a price war. We only respond to what's going on out there, and there's been some pretty competitive activity out there. But we have no desire to do that, but we will always do what's necessary to keep our brands competitive. But you're going to see something really big from us next year. We have historically launched a new product every 2 years. We did one -- so next year would be the year to launch a big new product. And this year, we did not have a big new product for our usual schedule, and some activity took on that kind of caught us by surprise, and so we've had to deal with that. But next year, we'll go back to what's always been successful for us, which is kind of a long history of success in this category, which is a big new product innovation coming out of Church & Dwight.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got you. And then I didn't catch the answer, but the reason for not buying back stock in the fourth quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Why would we want to buy back stock in the fourth quarter?
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Why aren't you going to buy back stock in the fourth quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, we have an authorization. We've chosen not to. That's a decision we look at every quarter. The management and the board discuss it, and we've opted not to. So we do have a lot of ability to buy back shares next year, and we certainly have the balance sheet to do it.
James R. Craigie: Okay, don't be a pig, Bill. We gave you 4 [indiscernible].
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess I just want to make sure I understand the Q4 sales outlook. Like I hear you, that response to your marketing plan -- those competitive marketing plans matter, but I guess that's always the case. But your outlook for Q4 does -- like it's 0.5 point to 2.5 points of growth implied by the full year. It does seem to imply sequential business slowdown, especially like in light of the fact that maybe your ferocious defense could be starting in that quarter. So I guess I want to understand how you're thinking about it.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, no, you're right. The -- as I said before that the -- if you have a full year range of 1.5% to 2%, that means that the range for the fourth quarter is going to be pretty wide, like 1% to 2.5%. So there's a lot of room in there for success or failure of our promotions with respect to the competition. And I would say it has gotten sequentially more difficult, Chris, as far as if you look at Q3 versus Q4 and what's going on on-shelf. So we recognize that, so we'd have a pretty wide range in there for the fourth quarter.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And I guess, back to the Tide, simply, launch, I mean, I know you don't want to divulge too much on your defense plans, but you got into the high end of your 3% to 4% for the year. It really doesn't sound like you're terribly concerned about what's going on there. I just was wondering if you could just give a little color on your thoughts. And is that right or you just think that other businesses are going to take the lead from a growth perspective next year?
James R. Craigie: No, no. I don't take anything lightly from the Procter & Gamble company. It's a major initiative by then -- them. We -- so like I said, we're -- we have a quite strong record of ferocious defense. We've taken them out in the past when they attacked OXICLEAN head on. And again, I would just remind you the end game. When 2 big players go to battle like this, and we'll do similar to what we did with the OXICLEAN defense, with the innovative new products, increased marketing spending, increased support, overall, often, the end result is, with us or Procter, Coke and Pepsi is -- usually, it's the other players who take the hit because the 2 guys going head-to-head often end up both winning, and the other smaller competitors often end up losing. So I'm all pleased. Believe me, I take this absolutely seriously. We've been all over this for months, and I feel very confident, though, that what we'll announce to you next year will delight you. And we'll do what we need to do to deliver what we're calling as organic growth at the high end of our 3% to 4% range, with laundry being a key player of that.
Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And I guess one last one. Just on that OXI defense, obviously, that was very successful, but that was Procter coming into a category where they didn't have much of an equity. Now they're swimming downstream, where they do have a pretty strong equity. And I guess you just haven't seen too many examples of that in these categories. And I guess, how are you thinking about that dynamic? I know you're viewing maybe the OXI example as informative, but I'm just wondering what the differences are in that you have a bigger brand but in -- with an actual equity in the category swimming downstream?
James R. Craigie: I wouldn't say Procter has no equity in the laundry additive category. Well, Procter is the giant in the overall laundry business, with products in almost every segment, and they entered that category with the Tide name, which is an incredibly powerful brand. So I consider it a very strong analogy to what's going on here. And yes, this laundry detergent, there's a lot of brands in there, but they're obviously ahead of that category also, but we're the strong #2. And again, the best way to fight that is to go out with innovative new products and increase marketing spending and have at it. And I feel confident that what we're going to do next year will deliver those results we need to deliver the kind of business results we're going to tell you about in February.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Another question on detergents. Is the increased promotional activity in detergents coming mainly from your biggest competitor above you or from the other 2 players or equally from everybody?
James R. Craigie: Sort of the latter, Alice, but it's all in different formats. The other competitors are mostly doing price. The big dog is mostly flooding the market with coupons. So it's been from all angles and that. So it's a bit of a war going on right now, but our share -- we're hanging in there pretty well. Our share growth is at record levels in Q3. And I just -- we know how to fight those kind of wars, and we'll do what's right to defend our brand.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: We know that Procter has got a bunch of innovations coming in detergents, and you apparently do. Do you know if the other players have innovation coming, too, or are they going to keep fighting on price?
James R. Craigie: I don't know that, Alice. I don't -- I can't comment on that.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And then some housekeeping stuff. Can we expect gross margins again to be up in 2014?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: We're not going to comment on that until the first week of February, Alice.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: All right. And then the other one is Avid. You said you -- for sure, it will grow double digits next year. Are you more comfortable with the number closer to 10% or closer to 20%? I'm trying to figure out how fast that double-digit momentum is.
James R. Craigie: Alice, I just won 2 bets about you. Keep going.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, well, it's not 99, Alice. It's double-digit, that's all we're going to say.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: All right. But I mean, is it just barely double digits or is it something stronger than that?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, I commend you for your persistence. We're going to -- you can see in the Nielsen data how this category has been growing and the fact that it's...
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes, but that's not very complete data, so...
James R. Craigie: Well, Alice, we invite you to the CAGNY event next February in Florida.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: How fast is Avid growing, overall, at this point, including all channels?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, I mean, on a pro forma basis, it would be growing in the 20s. So if you looked at 2012 versus '13, assuming we owned it in '12, it would be in the 20s.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Including in the third quarter, not just year-to-date?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: That's right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Steib from Crédit Suisse.
Michael Steib - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I have a couple of questions on costs. First, relating to commodity costs, it was flat in the quarter. What's your outlook, and how much visibility do you have as you enter 2014? And then secondly, have you realized all the cost savings now from the Avid acquisition?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, with respect to commodities, Michael, we have 8 commodities that represent -- that are our most volatile commodities. And we typically look at what percentage of those are hedged going into the coming year. And right now, we're about 30% hedged. Some of those commodities would include everything from resin to diesel, soda ash, paper products, palm fatty acid distillate, et cetera. So as far as Avid goes, and we have -- we -- when we bought that business, we said we saw $15 million of cost synergies. That number is going to be higher. We just don't update numbers like that after an acquisition. The way the $15 million split was $6 million of SG&A and $9 million of cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold numbers are certainly going to be higher. So -- and we're making really good progress with respect to expanding gross margin on that business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: For 2014, you didn't guide the EPS growth despite the top line guidance. Why is that? Are you still comfortable, conceptually, that double-digit earnings growth is the right range longer-term as you look out to 2014 and beyond?
James R. Craigie: No, we just don't normally give a forecast at this point in time. And we're still dotting the Is and crossing the Ts in our planning process. So we've always historically done that when we come out to the CAGNY meeting in 2014.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Because last year at this time you've given it, so I was wondering what the difference was versus last year.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, last year at this time, you may recall, we had just acquired the Avid business, so a lot of interest in how much we thought the Avid business is going to contribute to 2013. So we gave some people -- so we felt like -- obligated to call a number for the year at 14%, and that's where we're coming into, by the way.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. And then for 2013 earnings guidance, I guess I'm a bit confused why your earnings guidance isn't moving up. The tax rate's more favorable. Gross margins are coming in at the higher end of your range. Should we think about organic sales growth as maybe at the low end of your new range, or is it conservatism, or something else that's offsetting those favorable factors?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. Well, look, there's always a lot of moving parts in the P&L. And we were calling 2% organic growth up until this call. Now we're seeing 1.5% to 2%. So obviously, there's some earnings impact as a result of that, so there's some room there. As far as taxes goes, we got the benefit of a lower tax rate already in the first and second quarter. We're at 34% Q1, 34.5% in Q2. We stuck at 35% midyear because we were anticipating some things to happen in the second half but didn't. So then we posted the 34% again in Q3, so the whole year is going to be about 34%. So it's not like we'd kind of woke up to the entire benefit in the fourth quarter of a tax rate change, it's just that we came down off the number today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just had a question about your gross margin and, Jim, the comments you were making at the beginning about how you pay your people partly on gross margin. Can you give us a sense, kind of what the range of gross margins are? You don't even have to tell me what detergents are versus vitamins specifically, but kind of within the company helping a range of gross margins there are, because I'm trying to get a feel for how much some of the negative pricing you're doing might be hurting your gross margins versus favorable mix is boosting your gross margins.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, the only thing we've said historically with respect to that question is this is -- kind of a walking around number, that will be 20-margin-points difference between an average household versus average personal care, personal care being higher.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And so kind of as you think out over the next -- forget about next year, but kind of over next 3 to 5 years, I mean, you've been -- obviously, you've made huge improvements over the last 4 quarters. But over the last 3 years, you've been kind of in that 44 range. I mean, do you think that, with the benefit of favorable mix, you can break out sustainably and more consistently to sort of a 45, 46, 47 type number? Or what are you thinking about in terms of motivating people internally? Or is that hard to come by?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. Well, look, the things that move our gross margin is several things. One is new products, right, so new products that we launch are typically going to be higher than the brand average. So that's a mover within the business. And obviously, people are incented to develop products with higher gross margins. The second thing, you're correct, the personal care has been a bit of a drag at least certainly in the third quarter, x the Vitamin business, and that's the higher margin stuff. So that's the side of the business we would need to get rolling on a consistent basis because we've had some fits and starts over the last year or 2, where we were growing and then we were not growing. The third thing is acquisitions. So the acquisitions that we buy, typically, are gross margin accretive. That wasn't true for Avid because when we bought them, they had a 38% gross margin. But we did say that, over time, we expect to get that to corporate gross margins, and we're still committed to that. And so that's going to help us as well as we come up the line on that one. So it's new products, it's personal care improvement, and it's acquisitions. And finally, the most important thing in recent history is our good-to-great program, so our continuous improvement program. So think about the third quarter, where you have a huge negative price mix, and, at the same time, you're expanding your gross margin, and it's really remarkable. And the way this program works is we're always looking ahead the next 2 to 3 years where we can debottleneck plants and change formulations, negotiate with suppliers, through CapEx, automate our manufacturing processes such that we can reduce the cost per unit of our products. So that is central to our gross margin strategy going forward.
James R. Craigie: Yes, let me just jump in and say too, that, that's why 25% of every employee in this company's bonus is based on hitting the gross margin target. So that has been a major change in the culture of this company going back about over 5, 6 years. And I think everybody in this company has been talking gross margin, and that's how it really -- it really pays off when that happens. So that's how we keep getting all these improvements and gross margins. It's been a terrific result.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just want to go back to Avid for a second and try to tease out the growth for next year. I mean, obviously, you got a nice tailwind from market growth. But you also, I thought, when you bought it, it had a fair amount of innovation that was still in the pipeline that haven't come forward yet. And also, you had a nice distribution opportunity as well. So can you kind of just update us on what's going on in both of those fronts?
James R. Craigie: Joe, yes, we do have a lot of new products come in. The distribution gains happened over the course of the year, so we'll get a full year benefit in the next year. There's more distribution gains to come. We're still not where we want to be on that. So there's a lot of upside there. And just always keep in mind that gummy vitamins as a whole business, a whole category, is only 9% of the total vitamin category but growing about 5x to 6x the rate. So there's tremendous upside left for the gummy vitamins out there. The retailers see it, they're supporting it. The sampling, which we're driving hard, that's the best way to get people to understand the whole -- we do -- we've more than doubled the advertising on the business, but the sampling is crucial. When somebody tastes the gummy, they just can't believe that the vitamin -- the same vitamin nutrient as a hard pill is on the gummy that tastes so great. So we're just going to keep pounding that. We've got a tiger by the tail here, and we're going to do everything from increased marketing spending, new product innovations, increased distribution, increased sampling. We're just going to keep pounding it and delivering double-digit growth.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Where's the biggest opportunity for distribution expansion in '14?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Still the traditional food channel because that's the -- not only because the prior owners of the business literally didn't have the arms and legs to calm that channel, we do, so we're in there big time doing that. But there's other distribution opportunities in other channels too, but the biggest difference versus where we want to be, I would say, is still in the traditional food stores.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And just switching gears a little bit, I guess, for you, Matt. In terms of the organic growth, you mentioned 1% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter, and then 4-ish for next year. And that's sort of a like-for-like number in the sense that it's got Avid in both periods. So I'm just curious if you can just kind of bridge the gap between the 1.5 -- the 1% and 2.5% this quarter and the 4% next year. I mean, it sounds like you're assuming some moderation in promotional activity and some new products, as well, driving that.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, well, it's -- the new product introductions are the biggest factor. Well, we can't -- we won't talk about those until the first week of February. We still have vitamin growth next year. And we have the improvement in the cyclical Specialty Products business. So remember that business collapsed in the second quarter from a volume standpoint and, by itself, took our full year down by 50 basis points from an organic standpoint. So that will come back as well. But it's really those 3 factors: new products, vitamin growth and improvement in the cyclical Specialty Products business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Two questions. First thing is the implied increase in marketing spending in the second half is actually really -- it's quite large. So could you talk maybe a little bit more about the promotional aspects. I just want to make sure I'm correct that you're also planning a pretty significant increase in more advertising-type marketing spending.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, in the fourth quarter, Lauren?
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, that's true. That's the plan right now.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So that's not necessarily against new products, it's just sort of another way to combat the environment, perhaps, a little bit higher quality than just for pure promotion.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Right. It's -- again, we continue to support the brands, and we can't -- it's not going to -- the battle won't be fought completely with respect to price.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then the second thing was just, Jim, I was struck by your sort of, for you especially, relative optimism about the sort of competitive and consumer environment for next year and also by the fact that you commented on like innovation being the key, addressing [ph] almost if the innovation hadn't been that interesting this year. It just -- it didn't really feel like consistent with how you spoke about innovation from Church & Dwight at the start of the year. You had the laundry compaction. There was a lot of exciting stuff at that stock exchange meeting. So I mean, is it really just a similar year in terms of innovation? Are you more optimistic about how it plays out in the market? Or I don't know, it just seemed like a little bit different, for you especially.
James R. Craigie: No, Lauren, it's just a relative thing. We had a good pipeline of new products this year. It's just next year, by far, will be the biggest amount of new product launches we've ever had. And like I said earlier in a question, we -- as planned, we didn't have a new cat litter product planned for this year. We will have a big one planned for next year. Laundry will be doing things next year that we would normally be doing, plus maybe a little more because of some of the competitive activities going on. And the other categories, too, all really have some terrific stuff. I just don't want to tip my hat right now on some of the things we're doing, but when you see the first week of February, you will see -- well, we've always had good new product innovations in the past years. This will blow your mind next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Leigh Ferst from Wellington Shields.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: I also had a question about Avid distribution. Can you tell us what gains you've made so far and if you are where you want to be in terms of how you planned it for the last year?
James R. Craigie: Obviously, I'm not going to go into specific detail. Obviously, we've had significant distribution gains so far across almost every -- across every channel, period. And -- but I would still say there's a lot more to go. And if so, we've got our sales force every day is cracking accounts out there. See, what happens is accounts don't all make their decisions on the same day every year. Throughout the whole year, accounts -- some accounts make decisions on distribution in the first quarter, some in the second quarter, some in the third quarter, some in the fourth quarter. And so we just -- we have to go with that timing. And so our sales force is doing these accounts constantly out there, so we've had success over every quarter this year. We -- And I think we'll be able to have a lot more success going forward. All I'll tell you is there's some accounts out there that are close to where we want to be in distribution, but the large majority aren't, and we want to all get them there. And then we have a great new product pipeline coming, so great success in 2013, but still a long ways to go in 2014 and beyond.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay, and you mentioned in your comments that you have achieved distribution to offset some out of stocks in certain brands. Can you give us any more detail on that?
James R. Craigie: No, I think I made the point that our sales force -- we -- our shares are like steadily growing in laundry. It's up 50% in the past 5 years. And when you have that kind of share growth, you need more shelf -- space on the shelves to keep up, otherwise, you'll be out of stock. And that's where our sales force has done a great job. I was going out there and going over those numbers with the retailers. The retailers, yes, they see that. They realize they need to give us more shelf space or they will have out of stock. So it's been a big, big benefit to us, but we've had a big gain in distribution in a lot of categories this year to hopefully minimize the out-of-stock situation. So don't walk away thinking that out of stock has been a significant problem for us. It's not because our sales force has done a great job of getting increased distribution. And all the categories, we had great share growth.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. And you had a great track record making acquisitions. It sounds like you want to make another one, but, obviously, it takes 2 to tango. Will you be able to achieve your goals next year without an acquisition if, for any reason, you're not able to consummate one?
James R. Craigie: Yes. With the goals to be announced in February, well, it will not be based at all on an acquisition. We never do that. In the course of the year, we make an acquisition, we'll update the information, but we don't ever base our annual plan on making -- hoping to make an acquisition because you just can't -- you can't guarantee that.
Operator: Our last question comes from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.
Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I was hoping you would comment on the impact of compaction. Initially, when you launched ARM & HAMMER, the new concentrated version, you put it on store shelves next to the regular strength. I'm wondering if the shelf space has migrated entirely to the compacted version, if competitors have followed, as they did on the first round, and whether or not the increased profitability that comes out of a concentration like this has been funding a lot of the increased promotional activity.
James R. Craigie: I'll try to answer those 27 questions. No, I think this -- the compacted form of ARM & HAMMER, we call it 4X or Ultra Power, it's done very well this year. I think I said 70% of the share growth that ARM & HAMMER achieved in the third quarter came from that product. It's out there doing very well. Nobody has followed it yet -- but I'd say yet -- out there, but it's doing very well. We're very happy with it. It has not -- we regained distribution far beyond that product in the laundry category last year. So it was not the only gainer. And the product saw a nice contribution to us on sales and profits, but it wasn't the source from which we sourced any money for promotion dollars in that. So just overall, it's a good new product for us. We're very happy with it. Obviously, going forward, strongly, I would wish my competitors would take a closer look at that, but we'll see. I can't -- I can only control what we do, and I'm very happy with the success we've had with that product. Okay, everybody, I want to thank you very much for participating in the call today on a Friday. I hope you have a great weekend, and thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecast. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start this call by providing you with my overview of our second quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and to discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start out by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the second quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures, the second quarter results reflect double-digit net sales growth of 13.1%, a triple-digit increase in gross margin versus year ago for the fourth consecutive quarter, a 17% increase in marketing spending versus year ago, with supported share growth on 7 of our 9 power brands, a 15% increase in operating income and a 20 basis point increase in operating margin versus year ago, a 9% increase in earnings per share versus year ago and a 17.8% increase in free cash flow versus year ago. In addition, I'm pleased to report that the integration of our most recent acquisition, the Avid Health company, is off to a great start. Driven by double-digit sales growth and better-than-expected cost synergies. This strong start to 2013 makes us feel very confident at this point in time towards the achievement of our aggressive annual EPS growth target of a 14% increase versus year ago. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to give you specific details on our second quarter results. Then, I'll return to provide some further insights on the key results of our key brands and provide additional details in my outlook for the year.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. Our second quarter EPS was $0.61 per share compared with $0.56 in 2012. That's an increase of 8.9% from a year ago. Reported revenues were up significantly, up 13.1% to $788 million. Organic sales for our global, domestic and international consumer businesses were up 3.2%. However, the Specialty Products organic sales was down 11.2% due to a large drop in demand from our dairy customers as a result of the colder-than-normal Q2 weather. Our all-in organic sales was up 1.8%, and of the 1.8%, approximately 2.7% is due to volume, with 90 basis points of unfavorable mix and price. Now, let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increased 2.5%, primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent, OxiClean laundry additives, TROJAN products and FIRST RESPONSE diagnostic kits. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent and Nair depilatories. Volume contributed approximately 4.6% of sales, partially offset by 2.1% unfavorable effect of product mix and price. The International business increased organic growth by 6.3% in Q2 due to higher sales in Canada, the U.K. and Australia. We also had an easy comp year-over-year. This increase is driven by a higher volume of 2.8% and by 3.5% from product mix and price. For our Specialty Products Division, the organic sales, as I said, decreased 11.2%. Volume represented 10.9% of the decrease. Turning now to gross margin, our reported second quarter gross margin was 44.6%, a 110 basis points expansion from year ago. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the positive impact of our productivity programs. We have now had 4 consecutive quarters of 100 basis points or more of gross margin expansion, beginning with the third quarter of 2012 when we started up our Victorville, California plant. We've also brought laundry PODs in-house and we increased cat litter prices. Our 2013 improvement projects have also contributed to the 4-quarter gross margin streak. Also Q2 was the third consecutive quarter of personal care growth. The gross margin expansion in Q2 was better than expected due to faster realization and larger-than-expected cost savings in the gummy vitamin business. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to expand 50 to 75 basis points, which is up from our previously announced guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. And to the extent we expand our gross margin, we intend to spend a portion of the incremental gross profit back on the marketing line as we did in the second quarter. Marketing spend for the second quarter was $103 million or 13.2% of revenues. That's a 50 basis points increase over the prior year spend rate, [Audio Gap] higher on a dollar spend rate. We continue to support new product launches and we grew our dollar share for 6 of our 8 power brands in the second quarter. And this is due to great execution by our sales and marketing teams. We expect full year marketing as a percentage of sales to be up about 30 basis points to approximately 12.5%. SG&A year-over-year was higher by $14.6 million, primarily reflecting the inclusion of the Avid business. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.6% and that's up 40 basis points from year ago and that reflects higher stock option expense but it's partially offset by the leverage of the gummy vitamin business. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be approximately 12.9% of sales and that would be a 40 basis points improvement from the prior year, and this is a reflection of both our constant vigilance to control SG&A, as well as acquisition leverage. Operating profit is next. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 17.8%, which was a 20 basis points increase over last year's 17.6%. Income from affiliates decreased year-over-year primarily due to a charge associated with one of our joint venture affiliates and other expense was higher year-over-year, primarily due to interest expense related to the Avid acquisition. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 34.5% compared to last year's 35.6%. We continue to expect the full year effect of tax rate to be approximately 35%. With respect to cash, we generated $161 million of cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2013. That's a $28 million decrease over the prior year on a reported basis, but remember that we deferred a $36 million federal income tax payment from December 2012 to January 2013 as a result of Hurricane Sandy relief. So apples-to-apples, cash from operations is up $8 million year-to-date. We spent $20.1 million in CapEx, which is a $19.9 million decrease from a year ago, which, remember, included the 2012 construction of the company's Victorville, California plant. And we now expect full year CapEx to be approximately $80 million. Regarding other destinations for cash, no shares were purchased in the second quarter. And we have approximately $220 million remaining in our authorization. We did pay down $50 million of debt in the second quarter and so far this year, we've paid down $100 million. I'm going to wrap it up now. The second quarter highlights include 3.2% organic sales growth for the global Consumer business, 110 basis points of gross margin expansion, excellent progress from the gummy vitamin business and 8.9% EPS growth. And regarding the full year, we now expect full year organic sales to be approximately 2%. And if we take the midpoint of our previous 3% to 4% outlook, so let's call that 3.5%, there are 2 factors that bring it down to 2%. First, 50 basis points is due to an expected full year sales decline for our Specialty Products Division as we do not expect to overcome weak Q2 results. And the remaining 100 basis points is from negative price mix, which reflects our decision to be price competitive and respond to increased discounting in a few of our categories. That 100 basis points also reflects weak category performance, including laundry, which is expected to partially offset our significant distribution gains. With respect to gross margin full year, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we expect it to increase 50 to 75 basis points as we continue to gain the benefit of our productivity programs and capture synergies from our gummy vitamin business. And on the operating margin line, we expect approximately 70 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2013, which is well balanced in that it includes gross margin expansion, a spend back into the marketing line, increased marketing, and SG&A leverage as well. For Q3 specifically, we expect 1% to 2% organic sales growth, which reflects many of the same factors I spoke about with respect to the full year. Q3 gross margin will be comparable to the prior-year quarter. This is an improvement versus our previous thinking given the performance of our gummy vitamin business. And remember, we will be lapping some of the large benefits, which began in Q3 of 2012, and we will be absorbing the impact of more negative price mix. And Q3 will also be marked by an increase in marketing spend to support our key brands. Finally, we expect 10.6% increase in third quarter earnings-per-share to $0.73 per share compared to $0.66 per share last year. Back to you, Jim.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I'll finish off our call today by adding a little color to the second quarter results Matt just took you through and my outlook at the year. As stated earlier, those of you who haven't heard me speak before know that I've been a long-term pessimist about business environment. The latest forecast of weak GDP growth, continuing high unemployment and weak same-store sales by major retailers provides little hope for significant near-term improvement in the U.S. economy. In fact, of the 14 categories that Church & Dwight operates in, 5 incurred lower category dollar sales in the second quarter versus the prior year and 5 more had category growth of less than 2% versus the prior year. Now, all consumer packages companies are fighting these headwinds. As I told you many times before, I believe no other consumer packages company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. There are 7 key factors that support that statement. First, we have the most unique product portfolio within the CPG industry. It consists of both premium and value brands. This puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy as exemplified by our ability to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the prior 12 consecutive years. In particular, our value brands representing about 40% of our revenue base have experienced strong growth in the recessionary economy, as consumers are generally making smart choices by switching to and staying with our high-quality, but lower-priced brands. A great example of this is our value-based laundry detergent business, which consists of 2 brands, ARM & HAMMER and XTRA. These brands sell for 1/2 to 2/3 less than the premium-priced brands and deliver exceptional cleaning performance. Consumers love our value detergent brands as proven by the fact that more U.S. households buy a value brand than premium or mid-priced laundry detergent brands. The great value delivered by our 2 value brands has resulted in steady share growth. In the second quarter, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent achieved a record quarterly share of 9.6%, which was its 14th consecutive quarter share growth versus year ago and enabled us to pass the all brand to become the #3 brand in America. ARM & HAMMER was 1 of only 2 major brands to deliver share growth in both the second quarter and the latest 52 weeks. And I just learned yesterday that ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent hit an all-time record monthly share of 10.1% in the month of July. Our XTRA brand also achieved share growth in the second quarter. It is now the #2 liquid laundry detergent brand on a wash load basis, representing 1 out of 7 wash loads in America. The strong consistent share growth of both of these brands has enabled Church & Dwight to increase its liquid laundry detergent market share by 50% over the past 5 years and become the #2 laundry detergent company in America. The second factor, which is a key driver of Church & Dwight's success is that we have a proven record of building share on our power brands. We have over 80 brands, but 8 of these brands are our historic power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits. We have now added a 9th power brand with the acquisition of the Avid gummy vitamin business. From 2008 through 2012, we grew market share on each of the 8 historic power brands in almost 75% of the quarters. In the second quarter of this year, we grew market share on 6 of our 8 historic power brands and 7 of the 9 power brands including Avid. Three key factors drove these excellent share results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to increase marketing support on our power brands. The second quarter of 2013, we increased our marketing score by over $15 million versus year ago, which represented a 50-basis-point increase. The other factor driving the growth of our power brands is our robust pipeline of new products. Over the past 4 years, new products delivered about 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We have launched innovative new products in almost every key category this year. A sample of these new products includes ARM & HAMMER's new Ultra Power laundry detergent, which provides consumers with a more concentrated liquid laundry detergent in a smaller bottle, which is easier to handle, more environmentally friendly and enables dosage control for lightly soiled to heavily soiled wash loads. This new product is driving incremental sales for the brand, and as stated earlier, enabling the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent business to achieve its 14th consecutive quarter of share growth. Other new products that have been launched in 2013 or late 2012 include a new line of sexual lubricants under the TROJAN brand name; a new spa clay line of products under the Nair brand; a new toothbrush under the ARM & HAMMER TOOTH TUNES brand, which plays music by the One Direction boys band; a new single-dose cold sore treatment under the Orajel brand; and a new dishwashing booster product under the OxiClean brand. More detailed information on all of these innovative new products is on Church & Dwight's website. Part of the increased marketing spending behind these innovative new products is increased sampling. We will drive awareness and trial on our new TROJAN lubricant line by providing samples in 4 million boxes of TROJAN condoms. And to drive awareness and trial of our great tasty line of gummy vitamins, we'll increase in-store sampling by over 60% versus last year. In addition to the increased marketing spend in innovative new products, the other key driver of share growth in our power brands is increased distribution. As a result of the consistent strong share growth in our power brands over the past 5 years, the Church & Dwight sales force has worked closely with our retail partners to increase the shelf space of our brands, to meet both the increased consumer demand and minimize out of stocks. The distribution gains achieved in 2013 across all brands were the greatest in my 9-year tenure as CEO. The combined effect of these innovative new products, increased marketing spending and increased distribution, delivered organic growth on Church & Dwight's Global Consumer business of 3.2% in the second quarter, despite the weak economy and the increased competitive spending. These share gains in 7 of our 9 power brands puts us in a position to achieve stronger organic growth in 2014 behind a strong pipeline of innovative new products in our core business, continued strong growth of the new gummy vitamin business and an improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business. Let me just wrap up on this point about my company's ability to grow our power brands with the following Q2 share highlights on our other power brands. OxiClean powder laundry additive grew its category leading share by 1.5 points to 42.4% and is now over 2X larger than its nearest competitor. Spinbrush is the #1 battery-powered toothbrush across all classes of trade and is #1 for both kids and adults. In fact, the Spinbrush kids line has doubled its share since 2009 and now represents 5 of the top 10 selling SKUs, including 2 of the hot new TOOTH TUNES products. TROJAN grew its share to 76.2% of the U.S. condom business, driven by having all 10 of the top 10 selling retail SKUs. The new TROJAN lubricant line, which was launched in the second quarter, has already achieved a 5.5% share for the quarter and a 7% share in the month of June as it continues to gain distribution. FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits achieved a record quarterly share 31.3%, up 2.5 points versus year ago and has been the #1 selling pregnancy test kit for 34 consecutive quarters. Nair achieved share gains in the second quarter of 0.7 percentage points to 31.7% to maintain its leadership position for the 34th consecutive quarter. And finally, our new Avid acquisition had a terrific second quarter of 2013. Li'l Critters, our kids vitamin brand, achieved its highest dollar share ever based on 15.8% consumption growth. And Vitafusion, our adult vitamin brand grew its share driven by a 55% consumption growth. Vitafusion is the #1 adult gummy vitamin for the past 8 quarters and is the fastest-growing adult vitamin brand for the past 52 weeks. Now, that's a pretty impressive scorecard for Q2 share results. Let me run quickly to the 5 other key drivers of Church & Dwight's success. Number three is that we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands as evidenced by our ferocious defense of OxiClean when a large competitor entered the category several years ago. OxiClean not only fully deflected that attack, but now has strengthened its leadership position to the record share levels achieved in the second quarter, to be larger than the combined share of the #2, #3 and #4 competitors in the laundry additive category. The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our International business. While our International business represents only about 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high-single digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the last 5 years. As Matt mentioned earlier, this strong growth continued in the second quarter, with 6.3% organic growth, driven by excellent results in Canada, the U.K. and Australia. The International organic growth would have been even stronger except for lower sales of Nair, which was impacted by the cooler than expected weather in Q2. Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margins through cost optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher-margin new products. Driving improved gross margin is deeply ingrained in Church & Dwight's organization. We not only talk-the-talk, but we walk-the-walk. 25% of every Church & Dwight employees' annual bonus is based on achieving our gross margin improvement target. I'm not aware of any other CPG company that explicitly has gross margin targets in their employee bonus programs. This deeply ingrained and incentivized focus on gross margin has enabled Church & Dwight to expand gross margins by 1,450 basis points over the past 11 years. Headwinds from higher commodity costs stalled our gross margin improvement in 2010 and '11, but we were able to overcome these headwinds by the middle of 2012 to deliver 2 consecutive quarters of 100 plus basis point gain and gross margin versus year ago in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. This momentum continued in the first half of 2013 with 110 basis points increases in gross margin versus year ago in both the first and second quarters. And as Matt and I mentioned earlier, the cost synergies from the integration of the gummy vitamin acquisition are exceeding expectation, so we expect to deliver gross margin results for the rest of 2013 that exceeded our prior expectations. The sixth factor behind our continued success is our ability to tightly manage overhead costs. As Matt mentioned earlier, we expect to reduce SG&A as a percent of our net sales to decline again this year. This will enable Church & Dwight to continue to have the highest revenue per employee of any major CPG company. And finally, factor number seven is our strong record on free cash flow. Like gross margin, free cash flow is another one of the company's key components in our annual bonus program for all employees. As a result of having every employee focused on and incentivized to deliver higher free cash flow, we have quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. And over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income was 120%, which was best-in-class in the CPG industry. As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow in second quarter. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain, including construction of more efficient new plants and acquisition of leading brands. All of these factors give me great confidence of our ability to deliver our aggressive 2013 EPS targets of $2.79, which is an increase of 14% over 2012 adjusted EPS. We believe we can deliver this aggressive EPS target despite continued expected headwinds from weak consumer demand and increased competitive pressures. Our confidence to deliver this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors. First, we believe we can continue to deliver the market share gains on our power brands. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, increased marketing spending and significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands. Second, we now believe we can deliver gross margin expansion of approximately 50 to 75 basis points on our total business in 2013, including the new gummy vitamin acquisition. The higher projected gross margin will enable us to be price-competitive and increase marketing spending versus year ago on our power brands in the back half of 2013 to deliver the share gains. Unfortunately, these share gains did not fully offset the weaker-than-expected category trends and lower-than-expected sales of our Specialty Products business in the back half of this year. So we're now projecting organic sales growth of 2% for the full year. While this outlook on organic growth is a bit lower than our initial goal of 3% to 4%, the share gains will put us in position to return to higher organic growth levels in 2014, behind a great pipeline of innovative new products in our global Consumer business, continued strong growth of our gummy vitamin business and expected improvement in the sales of our cyclical Specialty Products business. In conclusion, 2013 is shaping up to be another challenging year. But when things get tough, you should place your bets on the company with a product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and a management team that has a track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio and drive cost savings to deliver consistently strong EPS growth. 2013 will be our 13th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth, and we believe we can continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth going forward. This ends our presentation. I now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I, will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was just doing the math on Avid and it looks like if you kind of run rate it, it's up like 30% since your acquisition. So when you kind of put it into the base, can you just talk about -- and the Nielsen Data, by the way, sort of corresponds to that, because if you look at your vitamin sales growth, it's like 30% every month. Kind of what's driving that? And do you think those trends can continue?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Bill, what's driving that is we've gotten significant distribution gains out in the marketplace through a great sales force execution and as I told you, we're doing 60% more sampling than past years. So we're doing a great job in driving the distribution and sales of the brand.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: The other thing, Bill, is the -- what you're looking at, the Nielsen Data, is an all-outlet, right? So there are obviously unmeasured channels in there as well that affect what the number is for us year-over-year. We did say double-digit growth going into the year, but of course, we didn't go any -- define that any more clearly than that. And if you want some color on the Avid acquisition, we did want to let you know that it's performing better. We're not going to be calling line items out with respect to the brand P&L. We did say that it was going to be a double digit. We are growing share. The gross profit is higher than we expected but our R&D spend is significantly higher than when it was a private company. And as far as the synergies go, you may recall, we called synergies of about $15 million. We said $9 million of that was going to be this year and $6 million next year. It's going to be more than $9 million. We're not going to be updating the number quarterly. We're just -- we're in a really good shape with respect to Avid.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: What are the unscanned channels that wouldn't be in Avid [indiscernible] except for Costco? That's sort of like the AO [ph], whatever they call it. Like, what's on the scan?
James R. Craigie: Largely the club stores, Bill.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, got you.
James R. Craigie: But remember, when we bought this business, the club store channel was about 40% of the total business.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, I didn't know that. And then, sorry to keep going on in the Avid thing, but I think -- is there Santa Cruz, I guess is the big competitor, the only other competitor in gummy, and I think it just got sold to another private equity party. Does that impact the competitive dynamic at all?
James R. Craigie: No, we don't think so.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of your organic growth gains [ph], I know the retailers kind of changed their planograms mid-way through the year. Were there any distribution losses that are going to drive some of the shortfall on the organic growth relative to the previous expectations?
James R. Craigie: No, there was nothing significant, Bill.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then what are the categories that are becoming much more price competitive? Because I know you didn't really drill down to that level in your prepared comments.
James R. Craigie: Yes, Bill, we've got to be careful what we say about price lift. Generally, there's only -- we said there's only a few categories and generally it's just in laundry and cat litter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you give us some clarity on how much worse the promotional environment has gotten in the laundry and cat litter category? And then also, are you expecting a volume payback from these pricing adjustments because based on the lower organic sales growth guidance, it doesn't sound like you're expecting much of a volume boost?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Dara, it's a good question, but it's hard to quantify. And really, again, I can't go into details on, in fact, pricing that much. There were issues out there, we decided to get price competitive. Again, because of our focus on gross margin. The great news was that we were able to get price competitive and increase our marketing spending. So we feel fully we have addressed the issues out there and things should get better, continue to drive good share gains for us, which we want going into 2014.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And are you expecting to get a volume payback from these actions or is it more just to reestablish price competitiveness versus their competitive set?
James R. Craigie: Well, that's built in to our forecast. Let me just tell you, we always want to be straight with you guys. We have these issues looking forward. We don't want to be a falling knife in the sense of making a little adjustment then another adjustment, another adjustment. We wanted to reset the year on organic side and, if anything, we're being conservative. But we'll see. But it's just a case of -- we felt it's appropriate and we gave it a specific call instead of a nebulous, lower end of this or that. So we gave it a 2%. But we think that's the bottom and hopefully, things could be better than that.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on the category weakness you referenced, is that just tied to the promotional environment and is that pricing related or do you think it's also tied to underlying consumer demand in terms of the U.S. consumer being weak?
James R. Craigie: I don't think -- there's nothing worse in the consumer environment. It's still weak. You know, we had issues in the laundry category for some new products launched a year ago. The good news on that is that the laundry category is starting to head back up. It bottomed out at about a negative 4.3% in the first quarter of this year, second quarter is minus 2.6% and we expect it to get better than that over the rest of this year and hopefully break into the black in 2014.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I know you haven't given guidance for 2014 other than saying that you hope to return to the 3% to 4% organic sales growth. Can you say something about whether you can again turn in another double-digit EPS growth rate as you've done for many years? We won't have accretion from the Avid acquisition and commodity costs look like they might be a little less benign. So what are things that could help you retain that double-digit EPS growth in 2014?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Alice, that's always our goal. We've done it for 13 years when this year finishes and I have every desire to keep that going forward a goal. The things that will help us do that is we have a great pipeline of new products for next year. We can't give any details right now but I just love what I see in the new products pipeline. We are going to be increasing marketing spending because we see gross margins being improved next year. And then we expect some bounce backs. The weather, we wouldn't expect to be as bad as this year, which will help both our Specialty Products Division and our Nair business. I told you just a moment earlier, you heard I expect improvement in the laundry category, which will also help. It's already coming back. That will all lead to stronger organic growth along with the gross margin improvement. And we always tighten our belts in SG&A and we believe that formula, we won't give you the details yet. We don't have them yet, exact numbers for every one of the P&L items. But we believe that combination will, once again, for the 14th year, lead to double-digit EPS growth.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And you just said that the detergent category is getting a little better and yet you are projecting the same 1% to 2% organic sales growth in the third quarter. It's the second quarter. Will we still see Domestic Consumer up 2.5% with strong volume and negative price? And why wouldn't Domestic Consumer be better in the third quarter than the second quarter given that detergents will be better as a category?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Alice, we don't call the organic growth by each of the 3 segments. We have a number out there of 1% to 2%, and that's an all-in number, including Domestic, International and Specialty Products.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I mean, will Specialty maybe get worse and Consumer better versus the third quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: No, no, the weather has gotten a little hotter. If you notice it was pretty hot July, so I don't expect the SPD to be the same drag in Q3 as it is in Q2.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: We're to say, we're taking a very conservative approach for the back half of the year, Alice. We feel it's appropriate and, like I said, that we hope it's a better than we're being called, but we're going to -- we decided to call kind of a floor on it and then see what happens.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And in just sticking with detergents, were your detergent sales overall, putting XTRA and ARM & HAMMER and powder and liquid altogether, were they up in line in the second quarter with that 2.5% for Domestic Consumer?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: I'm trying to look at numbers --
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Or faster or slower or -- I mean, really what matters is a detergents altogether, right?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. I don't have a number off the top of my head here, Alice. Our overall shares on laundry detergent, all channels, including non-measured channels, was up. What you don’t see is we had some very good results in the club store channel. Brands like ARM & HAMMER Liquid was up over 10% in the second quarter if you count all channels. So I don't have it in front of me the total laundry detergent business. So we're -- I can tell you, overall, we're performing better than anyone else in the category. It's just the category is real tough. When the category is down several percent, it's a little bit of a drag. It's hard to overcome.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Is ARM & HAMMER Liquid overall was up over 10% in value terms in the second quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities.
Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So it sounds like you have approximately 2% to 3% organic sales growth embedded in your guidance in the fourth quarter. And so I was kind of wondering what gives you confidence in seeing acceleration there. New products, I guess, probably less of a drag from Specialty Products. Maybe 2 months of Avid in your organic sales. Are those the things benefiting you? Or is there something I'm missing there?
James R. Craigie: No, Joe, the biggest factor is Avid goes organic in the fourth quarter.
Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, fair enough.
James R. Craigie: We're being conservative on the rest.
Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Right. Why was XTRA Liquid Laundry Detergent lower in the second quarter? I'm assuming maybe some competitive action on pricing there? But at the low price point, I would think you'd see a benefit from the consumer pullback. And then you've got the sell-on of some new fragrances and stuff like that, so just kind of curious on XTRA.
James R. Craigie: There was just a lot -- but not a lot. There was some very aggressive competitive activity in there that impacted XTRA.
Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then on gross margin, it sounds like based upon your guidance, probably slightly lower year-over-year in the second half. What are kind of some of the puts and takes in gross margin there? I mean, is Victorville done? I mean -- or can we see some more incremental benefit from that? And has all laundry detergent production on the West Coast moved into Victorville? Or is there still some more to come there?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Well, let's do them in reverse order. So with respect to Victorville, Victorville does make a lion's share of not only the laundry, but also the cat litter that goes out to the West Coast, but not exclusively. With respect to the benefit of it, to the extent that, that business grows, we get a significant leverage on variable margin. We've been running the plant for a year. We continue to get better in reducing our product costs and improving our conversion rates. So I would say that is certainly going to help us not only this year, but going forward. But back to your question about the fourth quarter. In the second half, if you look at the first half, we've got 110 basis points in Q1 and Q2. So that's averaging about 55 basis points. For a full year basis, if we were flat in the second half. So we do think that in the second half, we are going to be up still a little bit more. I think Q2 -- or Q3, I mentioned earlier, would be flat, about the same as last year, which was 45.2% gross margin. But you're right about the fourth quarter. And as you move into the year, yes, you're selling more of your newer products. We try to launch new products at higher-than-average gross margins. And we continue to get more and more benefits from the gummy vitamin business, so that's higher than expected and that's -- and Q4 is a big quarter for vitamins. Historically, it's the biggest quarter of the year. So there are a number of things that are influencing the gross margin year-over-year growth. So I would say flattish in Q3 and then up a little bit in Q4.
James R. Craigie: Yes, Joe, don't forget, we had some major productivity programs kick in, in Q3 of year ago. Being the new Victorville plant, we brought the unit dose product in-house. We had a price freeze on cat litter. So we benefited for the 4 quarters that followed that quarter all the way through Q2 of this year. Now, we'll start lapping that. So that's why we still have productivity programs going on. Like Matt said, they'll still drive, in the back half, some improvement versus year ago back half, but we're now lapping beyond those major programs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to follow up a little bit actually on the guidance for the rest of the year and especially as you talked to the fourth quarter. I mean, if Avid is running plus 20%, 30%, it's going to add a couple of points to your organic growth in the fourth quarter by itself. So are you expecting the business to not -- the core business not to really improve from current levels through the whole back half of the year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Bill, we're not going to comment on the breakout between Domestic, International and SPD. You're right that gummy business is a big driver in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we do expect growth from the Consumer business in both Q3 and Q4, but not as much as we had expected historically.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Then on that same line, when I'm looking at the margins, with Avid growing faster than expected, are we getting close to having Avid at corporate gross margins or are we -- I mean, can we exceed that by the end of this year? Because you would seem to need to have some improvement by the fourth quarter, which is weighted towards vitamins.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, it would be really unusual for us to announce to retailers and competitors what our gross margin is for that or any other business, frankly. You remember, we bought a business at a 38% trailing gross margin and we've said that we're ahead of schedule, but we're not -- I don't expect today or in the future to call out gross margin by quarter. But I can say that we are very happy with where we are today.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the detergent side, you talked about price competition. But you look at the leader, they're way much higher than you on price. So are you seeing new competition from some of the flankers from -- that are priced more in and around all -- I mean, ARM & HAMMER and XTRA?
James R. Craigie: No, I really don't want to get into that. I don't want to name names. There's 4 key competitors in the category. It's always a very competitive category. And I'll just tell you, you know in the past, we're very good at it, that why our share has grown consistently, and we do what we have to do to continue to drive share growth in the category.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: All right. Last one for me, animal husbandry. Is this just people drinking less milk because of the weather or was something with the cows not getting enough pasture or anything I'm missing?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Animal husbandry? That's a new one.
James R. Craigie: Yes, actually, this will be the Discovery Channel portion of the earnings call. So the product that we make actually replaces electrolytes in cows. So sodium, potassium, et cetera. When the weather is really, really hot, what happens is cows start making milk. So by replacing that, they start producing milk. And when it's cold, there's no need for a number of our products. That's as simple as that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit about restructuring. Given heightened competition domestically, I don't -- it doesn't sound like that's going to end anytime soon. So is there a need to do something a little bit more drastic in terms of cost cutting, more restructuring in order to fund the incremental promotion, incremental activity that needs to be done to defend your share within your categories?
James R. Craigie: Olivia, you said more restructuring. We don’t need -- we've never had restructure, we're not going to restructure. We started small, we're going to stay small and we have highest revenue per employee in the industry. We always look for across the line how to keep our overheads tight and through cost-saving programs and leveraging acquisitions, we've been able to steadily take our SG&A and some of that revenue down over year. So we don't have the problem other guys do because we're already very low on overheads but amazingly find ways to keep taking it lower. But not through major restructuring programs.
Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then longer-term, where do you think that advertising goes over a longer term? I mean, if we're at sort of the 12.5-ish percent this year, does it go back up to where it has been in the past or is longer-term 12.5% still the right number?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, we've said in the past that 12% to 13% is the sweet spot for our marketing as a percentage of sales. And at that, a far more important measure is tracking your share of voice versus your share market. So what you're spending is always in relation to your competitors. So we follow that very closely and we're typically over indexed, meaning that our share of voice is significantly higher than our share of market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to start with Avid, I guess. In the past you've talked about cost savings. This year, I think of about $9 million, and then $15 million total. Obviously, it seems like things are going better than you expected there. So could you just update us on what your expectations are on the cost savings side for this year and then for next year as well?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. So really short answer, Joe. No. Well no, we -- you're right, we said $15 million, we said $9 million this year and $6 million next year. And of the $9 million this year was split, a 50-50 between COGS and SG&A. And next year was -- that $6 million next year was all SG&A. And what I said earlier is that we're ahead of schedule. This year is going to be more than $9 million and the total is going to be more than $15 million.
James R. Craigie: But it's very much like all the other acquisitions we've done in the past. Typically when we acquire a business, we identify cost synergies. We generally base the acquisition on the cost synergies. So we always hit them. And the goal is to exceed them.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, understood. And then secondly, Matt, you mentioned earlier that there was a charge at one of your affiliates. What is the size of that charge?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: That's $0.01.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And then just lastly, in terms of your laundry distribution, obviously, you talked about gaining a lot of distribution. Mostly this quarter, I thought, so I was a little bit surprised at the slowdown in household growth, but obviously, you talked about pricing there, et cetera. Have you guys maintained most of that shelf space gains? Are you expecting anything incremental in the back half?
James R. Craigie: Well, absolutely, no. We gained them, Joe, starting in Q2 and we certainly have maintained them since then. It's way too early to have any reversal of that. But we don't expect it. Everything we've gained has proven to be gold for us and the retailers. So everything is good so far.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Anything incremental on the back half?
James R. Craigie: Only if we were to launch a new product or 2, and sometimes we do that in the back half. But most of it is on the front half of the year, but there may be one at the back half.
Operator: Our next question comes from Leigh Ferst of Wellington Shields.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: There were a lot of questions about vita already, but I just was wondering also about next year. It seems like it could be a significant portion of your organic outlook -- or organic growth with outlook with it and the base. And I realize it's early, but can you comment on that with respect to the vitamins versus the rest of the core business?
James R. Craigie: Leigh, it's because of the distribution gains that we've been picking up over the course of this year and we expect more in the back half of this year, I would just tell you, top line, to expect continued double-digit revenue growth on the vitamin business in 2014.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: But as a portion of your organic growth outlook for next year? It seems like it's a major portion still like it would be on the fourth quarter?
James R. Craigie: Well, no. Well, keep in mind that the vitamin business is only about less than 10% of our total revenues. So put that in perspective with that kind of growth.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess I should know this, but are you going to count it in your premium value mix, which piece is it in?
James R. Craigie: Vitamins will be premium.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. And with respect to your cost-cutting, I mean you've done a great job for a long time and you sound confident that it can continue, but at what point do you feel like you're cutting too close to the bone? How do you look at that over a long-term perspective?
James R. Craigie: No, we were not anywhere near the bone. We're very lean and mean, but honestly, my team, as I told you before, it's 25% of their bonus every year and they're incented to keep finding ways to deliver gross margin improvement. And then when it's that much in the culture and in the pocketbook, trust me, they keep finding ways through efficiencies from efforts within the plants, the product lines. They're putting up new products with higher gross margins. We'll be doing things again next year in some of our plants to make them more efficient in that, product mix, trade spending, all that. We -- we're all over that every day. Again, my teams have the incentive through their bonuses in that to stay on top. It's just part of our culture. It's an incredible thing here at Church & Dwight and it's shown up this year. And I told you before, we fought off the headwinds and higher commodities in prior years better than anybody else and we came out of it strong now with 4 straight quarters of 100 basis points or more growth. And so I expect gross margin improvement to be no problem and continuing to improve in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy is CLSA.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: A couple of things, just looking at Avid, you talked about increased R&D. Can you elaborate on how this business might be different in an R&D -- from an R&D perspective? Was it simply there wasn't much done before and you're taking it to sort of normal levels? And a follow-on to that, do you see a lot of opportunity to expand beyond the existing products that you offer for Avid?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Caroline, this is Matt. So, yes, you're right in that this was a privately-owned business before and obviously, the capabilities that we have from an R&D perspective are far more expansive than what they had available to them. And we obviously have grand plans for this business, so we're immediately getting after ideas we have to expand the business. So it is significant -- we're spending significantly higher than what they would have spent in the past.
James R. Craigie: I would tell you too, sorry to pipe in. While we're the #1 gummy vitamin business, we're only 3% of the total vitamin category. So, to us, there's still tremendous upside in this business and part of that is growing the distribution base, part of that is putting more marketing spending behind the company. But part of that is also expanding the product line. It's wider than you may think right now. It's quite an expensive product line. But we see bigger opportunities in the future and for competitive reasons, I won't go into what. But we love the vitamin category. It's one of the fastest-growing categories in the world. It's been that way for a long time. And now we have what we think is a competitive advantage in that category with the gummy business and we're just, as Matt said, putting lots of R&D spending behind it to make sure we can capture all that growth.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. So we could probably expect a number of new products over the next 2 to 3 years?
James R. Craigie: The next 20 to 30 years.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay, but short term, as well?
James R. Craigie: Absolutely.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then you have a couple of your focus brands that aren't doing as well? I believe Nair was one of them. What do you see happening on those couple of underperformers and what do you imagine you can do to change that?
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes. Well Nair -- Nair as I said, Nair is the good news was it grew its share. The bad news was the weather really hurt that business this year. The category was down over 10% in the second quarter. So that was just totally driven by bad weather. And Nair is actually a bigger business for us outside the United States than it is in the U.S. and it's the foreign markets also had weather. So Nair isn't totally due to weather problems. The other categories are that there were some competitive things going on and we'll be addressing that with new products and marketing spending. But again, the overall story is 7 out of our 9 power brands grew share. So we feel pretty happy our new products are working and only a few had minor problems. On net -- like I said, Nair actually grew its share, but the category was really hurt by the weather. So next year, I expect a total rebound on Nair to help us.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: And dare I ask, but you did venture into some interesting line extensions with electronics. And it's not a core business, sort of electronic expertise, and I'm just wondering how that's doing.
James R. Craigie: I'm sure you're talking about the Spinbrush business? No, just seriously --
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: No, I'm not. Yes.
James R. Craigie: That business is doing fine. It's a small business. We're getting generally about double-digit growth on that. But it's a very, very, very small base. And I'll be honest, the biggest issue we have there is getting more retail distribution on that product line. We're working on it over time, but it's a little harder given the sensitivity of that business than anything else we have. Everything else, retailers have no problem with, so we're having a little bit of some retailer resistance on that.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then on the big product, laundry category, you've been vocal that you think PODs have not -- are not a good thing for the category. Can you update us on your thinking? I'm also very clear in the P&G conference call yesterday and the way they've structured their management reporting, that the U.S. is an enormous focus for them. So any update on your thinking on laundry category?
James R. Craigie: Yes. I mean, the laundry category was a steadily growing category until PODs was introduced and it was introduced last Q2 and the category shrank 0.2%. In Q3, the category shrank 1.3%. In Q4, the category shrank 3.2%. And in Q4 it shrank 4.3%. Now, that's 4 quarters. We're coming out of it. The category only shrank 2.6% in Q2 of this year and we think in the back half of the year, it'll get better versus those numbers as we lap the PODs. So I think it definitely had an impact. It wasn't the only thing going on in the category but it definitely had an impact. But I think the brunt of that impact is behind us and I'm optimistic that by 2014, the laundry category will get back into a positive growth mode, which will be wonderful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: First, just, sorry, on laundry again, I just was curious how the ARM & HAMMER unit dose is doing and if, when you guys talk about powder laundry, if that includes unit dose or not? Because I think in Nielsen, it does as they categorize it in powder.
James R. Craigie: It's doing okay, Lauren. We've got a little bit less than our fair share but still a healthy mid-single digit share number on that and we're doing fine. We don't look at it within powder. We kind of look at it as a separate category in [indiscernible]. I mean, keep in mind too, for us good news; for maybe somebody else, not good news. The unit dose or you may call it POD category is still -- it level off at 8% of total laundry. It was 8% last Q4, it's 8% in Q1 of this year, it's 8% in Q2. So we're happy that, that's a leveling off and we're fine with our share in the category.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So the powder laundry decline is still a separate conversation from unit dose performance.
James R. Craigie: Right, right. And keep in mind, I mean, liquid is still 77%, 78% of laundry. That's where your focus should be. Powder is about 15% of laundry and PODs is only 8%. So that's our focus -- that's why we put our focus more this year on launching the Ultra Power, new ultra-concentrated form of liquid, because we want to help spur the 77%, 78% of the category rather than worrying about a new small category. We're players in the PODs category but our focus is more on liquid.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. Has there been any trade-off on distribution, so that new distribution for Ultra is replacing unit dose -- your unit dose products?
James R. Craigie: No. Oh, no, absolutely not. We only -- we told the retailers, we would only give them the Ultra Power if they put it in incrementally, and they all did. The product is doing fantastic. It represents over half of our share gains on ARM & HAMMER Liquid this year. So it's coming in very incremental and the results are very positive. I would just say on concentration, I want to talk about for a second -- the next round of concentration. I can't give you a timeframe, but it is an absolute winner for the category. It's been historically proven in this category, back several years. It grew the category mid- to high-single digits. It's being proven again right now in the bleach category as you probably heard in the Clorox call yesterday. There's mid- to high-single digits category growth. So when you talk about a product that's good for the category, good for the environment, good for retailers, good for everybody, and the consumers have embraced it, it's a winner. And I think some time in the near future here, you'll hopefully see the whole laundry -- liquid laundry category go through another round of compaction, which will be great for all players.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. And then just on the International business, was the price mix [indiscernible] was a pretty big jump, was that more mix or more price?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Was more mix, actually. And remember, we had a goofy comparison year-over-year where we were down last year. So we had an easy comp.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So going forward, we should -- there isn't necessarily an incremental pricing element that we should be thinking about modeling for International?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: It's hard to say. The international markets are just as competitive as the domestic market. So whether or not that price sticks, remains to be seen, the price piece of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets.
Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Did the sales decline in the Specialty business have a positive impact on the corporate gross margin? And if so, by how much?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: It's a good question, Connie. I don't have the number for you but the answer is, yes. And that's because the gross margins for the Specialty Products business are half of what the Consumer business is. But I don't have that math for you handy.
Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And also can you -- do you ever think of how the Specialty businesses fit into portfolio on a strategic basis over -- going forward?
James R. Craigie: Well, Connie, the Specialty Products business has been long part of this company. On a year-over-year basis, it matches [ph] about half the company average. But actually on a bottom line margin basis, it's very comparable to company because we don't spend much marketing money there. Cows haven't listened to our ads in a long time, so we gave up. So -- no, it's a very good business in the bottom line and I don't see reason why we would change that going forward.
Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then just of course, a question on laundry. What is it that you have announced to the trade about your changes in either pricing or promotion? Will there be list price changes or is it increased trade promotion or more couponing or what's already been announced?
James R. Craigie: Connie, that's a no-no. I can't go into that kind of discussion.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session of today's call. Participants, you may now disconnect. Thank you for participating.
James R. Craigie: All right, thank you all very much for taking time to listen to us today. Just want to reiterate we stand behind the full year outlook in our earnings release, and again, hopefully gave you all the details. If you have any questions, give Matt a call after the conference today and we'll do our best to answer them. So thanks very much. Bye-bye.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial adjusted and forecast. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have outstanding results to report. I will start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our first quarter business results, which you've read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details of the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and to discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for the first quarter business results that we achieved. Despite headwinds from weak consumer demand, the first quarter results reflect solid organic revenue growth on top of a very high year-ago base, a triple-digit increase in gross margin versus year ago for the third consecutive quarter, higher marketing spending, which supported share growth on 7 of our 8 power brands, record quarterly operating margin of almost 22%, a 15% increase in earnings per share versus year ago, and strong free cash flow. In addition, I'm pleased to report that the integration of our most recent acquisition, the Avid Health Company, is off to a great start, driven by double-digit sales growth and better-than-expected cost synergies. This strong start to 2013 makes us feel very confident at this point in time towards the achievement of our aggressive annual EPS growth target of plus 14% versus year ago. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to give you more specific details on our first quarter results, and then I'll return to provide some further insights on the outstanding results of our key brands and provide additional details on my outlook for the year.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everybody. I'll start with earnings per share. First quarter earnings per share was $0.76 per share compared with $0.66 in 2012, and that's up 15% from a year ago. Our reported revenues were up 12.8% to $779 million. Organic sales were 2% over the prior year's high organic sales growth of 8.4%. The 2% organic calculation excludes the Avid acquisition, foreign exchange rate changes and it's also net of a 1% reduction due to the estimated impact of our SAP implementation which took place on January 1, 2012. Of the 2% organic growth, approximately 2.4% is due to volume with 40 basis points of negative product mix and pricing. And once again, volume is driving our results. Now let's review the segments. Consumer domestic's organic sales increased by 1.4%, primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER Liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, OxiClean laundry additives, Trojan products and FIRST RESPONSE diagnostic kits. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powdered laundry detergent and Kaboom cleaners. Volume contributed approximately 1.8% to organic sales, partially offset by 40 basis points negative effect of product mix and price. It is worthy to note that our domestic business is copying a 10% growth rate in Q1 2012. Our international business increased organic growth by 5.2% in Q1 due to higher sales in Mexico, the U.K., and Australia. And this increase is driven by a 6.2% higher volume and is offset by 1% negative price mix. For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales increased by 80 basis points, with favorable product pricing contributing 1.2%, offset by 40 basis points volume decrease. And we expect to deliver organic sales for the company of 3% to 4% in Q2, and for the full year. Gross margin. Turning now to gross margin, our reported first quarter gross margin was 44.9%, that's a 110 basis point expansion from the prior year. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the positive impact of productivity. So for example, the unit dose laundry production is now in-house in our Victorville plant, which started up last year, is now in full swing. The strong gross margin increase was also positively impacted by the growth of our high-margin personal care business, and also faster than expected cost savings on the Avid acquisition. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to expand 25 to 50 basis points, up from our previously announced guidance of flat. And to the extent that we expand our gross margins in 2013, we intend to spend the incremental gross profit back on the marketing line. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $79 million or 10.1% of revenues, and that's a 30 basis points increase over the prior-year spend rate, and $10 million higher on a dollar spend basis. We continue to support new product launches and we grouped dollar share on 7 of our 8 power brands in the quarter. This is due to great execution by our sales and marketing teams. As in Q1, we plan to continue to invest any incremental gross profit in higher media spend to support our power brands in future quarters. SG&A year-over-year was higher by $10 million. Remember that the vitamin business is now in our numbers. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.1%, which is down 20 basis points from the prior year, this primarily reflects the inclusion of the Avid business, but it's partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be approximately 12.8%, which is down 50 to 60 basis points from the prior year. This is a reflection on our continuous vigilance over controlling SG&A. Now operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, which is 100 basis points higher than last year's 20.7%. Income from affiliates decreased year-over-year, primarily due to lower income from our Armand Products joint venture, as well as start up cost related to our Natronx joint venture. On a full year basis, we expect a year-over-year decrease of $2 million in JV income. With respect to other income and expense, other income and expense was unfavorable year-over-year, primarily due to interest expense related to the Avid acquisition. This holds true on a full year basis as well and we expect a decrease of $14 million in other income expense on a full year basis, primarily related to interest expense. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 34% compared to last year's 33.1%. The Q1 2013 rate was favorably affected by retroactive reinstatement of research credits and the prior-year rate benefited from the settlement of an IRS audit. And we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. Now let's talk about cash. We generated $72 million of net cash from operations for the first 3 months of 2013, and that's a $42 million decrease over last year. But remember that $36 million of that decrease relates to the deferral of our December 2012 estimated federal tax payment, which was deferred to January of 2013, as a result of Hurricane Sandy relief. This year's quarter also saw a larger increase in working capital. With respect to CapEx, we spent $10.4 million in CapEx and that's a decrease from year ago. Stock buybacks, as previously mentioned in February, when we gave our full year outlook, the company purchased $50 million or 900,000 shares of its common stock in the first quarter. That leaves us with approximately $220 million remaining on our authorization. We also paid down $50 million of debt in the first quarter. So I'm going to wrap it up now in conclusion. The first quarter highlights include 2% organic sales growth, a wide expansion of gross margin driven by 2.4% volume growth and 15% EPS growth. Now I'm going to give you some comments on the second quarter. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.58 compared to $0.56 last year. And as we mentioned in the release, we expect Q2 sales in the 3% to 4% range, and we also expect continued growth in our personal care business. Secondly, gross margin will expand again in Q2, however, not at the same rate as Q1. And there are a few influencing factors. Here are a couple. The new distribution wins that we've spoken about are requiring much higher slotting year-over-year, and we have higher year-over-year couponing behind our new products. Most importantly, Q2 will also be marked by a significant increase in marketing spending to support our key brands to effectively drive share gain to offset a weak category environment. Finally, SG&A in the second quarter will be higher, both sequentially and year-over-year, due to higher R&D spend behind our innovation efforts and also higher stock option expense. Back to you, Jim.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I'll finish up our call today by adding a little color to the outstanding first quarter results, which Matt just took you through, and my outlook on the year. Those of you who've heard me speak before know that I've been a long-term pessimist about the business environment. The latest forecast of weak GDP growth, continuing high unemployment, and weak same sale stores growth by our major retailers provide little hope for near-term improvement in the U.S. economy. In fact, of the 13 categories that Church & Dwight operates in, 7 incurred lower category dollar sales in the first quarter. Now all consumer packages companies are fighting these headwinds. As I've told you many times before, I believe that no other consumer packages company is as well-suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. There are 7 key factors that support that statement. First, we have the most unique product portfolio within the consumer package goods industry. It consists of both premium and value brands, which puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy, as exemplified by our ability to deliver double-digit EPS growth for 12 consecutive years. In particular, our value brands representing about 40% of our revenue base have experienced strong growth in this recessionary economy. As consumers are generally making smart choices by switching to, and staying with, our high-quality but lower-priced brands. A great example of this is our value-based laundry detergent business, which consists of 2 brands: ARM & HAMMER and XTRA. This brands sell for 1/2 to 2/3 less than premium-priced brands and deliver exceptional cleaning performance. Consumers love our value laundry detergent brands, as proven by the fact that more U.S. households buy a value brand than premium or mid-priced laundry detergent brands. The great value delivered by our 2 value brands has resulted in outstanding growth. ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent has delivered 13 consecutive quarters of share growth versus year ago. In the most recent quarter, it achieved a record quarterly dollar share of 9.1%, which enabled us to surpass the All-Brand to become the #3 brand in America. ARM & HAMMER was the only laundry detergent brand with a unit dose form that did not incur lower year-over-year sales of its liquid form in the first quarter. Our XTRA brand also achieved share growth in the first quarter, it is now the #2 liquid laundry detergent brand on a wash load basis, representing 1 out of 7 wash loads in America. The strong consistent share growth of both of these brands has enabled Church & Dwight to increase its liquid laundry detergent market share by 50% over the past 5 years, and become the #2 laundry detergent company in America. The second factor which is a key driver of Church & Dwight's success is we have a proven record of building our power brands. We have over 80 brands, but 8 of these brands are our historic power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits. From 2008 through 2012, we grew market share on each of these power brands in almost 75% of the quarters. In the first quarter of this year, we grew market share on 7 of our 8 power brands. Three key factors drove these excellent share results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of our increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to increase marketing support on our 8 power brands. In the first quarter of 2013, as Matt told you, we increased our marketing support by over $10 million versus year ago, which represented a 30 basis point increase. The other factor driving the growth of our power brands is a robust pipeline of new products. Over the past 4 years, new products delivered about 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We plan to ship innovative new products at every key category this year to support delivery of our organic growth target of 3% to 4%. We expect these new products to be as successful as the new products we introduced over the past 4 years, and we expect these new products to drive improved category growth by providing consumers with new and improved benefits. A sample of these new products includes ARM & HAMMER's new Ultra Power Laundry Detergent, which provides consumers with a more concentrated liquid laundry detergent in a smaller bottle which is easier to handle, more environmentally friendly, and unlike the new unit dose products, it provides dosage control for lightly soiled to heavily soiled wash loads. We are also passing some of the savings from the smaller bottle back to consumers in the form of a 20% more wash loads. Other new products that have been launched in 2013 or late 2012 include: Trojan's new Pure Ecstasy condom and the new line of Trojan lubricants; the Nair Spa Clay line of products; Tooth Tunes toothbrushes, which play music by the highly popular One Direction boy band. Orajel's single-dose cold sore treatment; and Oxiclean Dishwashing Booster. Details for all these great new products are on Church & Dwight's websites. Part of the increased marketing spending behind these innovative new products is increased sampling. For example, we will drive awareness and trial of our new Trojan lubricant line by providing samples in 4 million boxes of Trojan condoms. And to drive awareness and trial of our great-tasting line of gummy vitamins, we will increase the in-store sampling by over 60% versus last year. In addition to the increased marketing spending on innovative new products, the other key driver to share growth on our power brands is increased distribution. As a result of the consistent strong share growth on our power brands over the past 5 years, the Church & Dwight sales force has worked closely with our key retail partners to increase the shelf space of our brands to meet the increased consumer demand and minimize out of stocks. The distribution gains achieved in 2013 across all brands were the greatest in my 9-year tenure as CEO. And along with the increased marketing support and great new products, should drive continuous strong share gains for Church & Dwight in 2013. Timing-wise, the new products and distribution gains did not begin impacting retail results until late March. So while there were some minor benefit in the first quarter, the full benefits should start occurring in the current second quarter. Let me just wrap up this point about my company's ability to grow our power brands with the following recap of Q1 results on our key brands. OxiClean Powdered Laundry Detergent additive achieved a record quarterly share of 43.3% on a double-digit sales increase, and is now over 2x larger than its nearest competitor. ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter achieved its 37th consecutive quarter of net sales growth. Spinbrush is the #1 battery-powered toothbrush across all classes of trade, and is #1 for both kids and adults. In fact, the Spinbrush kids line has doubled its market share since 2009, and now represents 5 of the top 6 selling SKUs, including 2 of the hot new Tooth Tunes products. The Trojan brand achieved record quarterly sales and grew its share to 76.2% of the U.S. condom business, driven by having all 10 of the top 10 selling retail SKUs in the condom category. FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits achieved a record quarterly share of 31.5%, and has been the #1 selling pregnancy kit for 33 consecutive quarters. And Nair achieved share gains in the first quarter to maintain its leadership position in depilatories for the 34th consecutive quarter. And finally, our new Avid acquisition had a terrific first quarter. Our vitamin business consumption was up 38% versus total category growth of about 8%, as measured by Nielsen all-outlet dollar sales. As a result, both VitaFusion, the adult gummy brand, and Li'l Critters, the kid's gummy brand, achieved record shares of their respective adult and kid's categories. That's a pretty impressive score card for Q1 results. And as I said earlier, the first quarter results only reflect the partial benefit from the new products and increased distribution since these benefits did not begin impacting sales until late March. We expect to experience the full benefit of these initiatives in the remaining 3 quarters of 2013. Now let me run quickly through the 5 other key drivers of Church & Dwight's success. Number three, is we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands, as evidenced by our ferocious defense of OxiClean when a large competitor entered the category several years ago. OxiClean not only deflected that attack, but now has strengthened its leadership position through the record share levels achieved in the first quarter. The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our international business. While our international business represents only about 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high single-digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit over the past 5 years. And as Matt mentioned earlier, this strong share growth continued in the first quarter, with 5.2% organic growth driven by excellent results in Mexico, the U.K. and Australia. Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margins through cost optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies, and launching higher-margin new products. We've expanded gross margin by 1,450 basis points over the past 11 years. Headwinds from higher commodity costs stalled our gross margin improvement in 2010 and 2011, but we were able to overcome these headwinds by the middle of 2012 to deliver 2 consecutive quarters of 100-plus basis point gains in gross margin versus year ago in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. This momentum continued in the first quarter of 2013, with a 110 basis point increase in gross margin versus year ago, despite the drag from the lower-margin Avid acquisition. And as Matt mentioned earlier, we now hope to deliver better-than-expected gross margin results for the rest of 2013. The sixth factor behind our continued success is our ability to tightly manage overhead cost. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major consumer package goods company. As Matt mentioned earlier, our SG&A costs were 20 basis points lower in the first quarter to 13.1% of net sales, supported by the leverage gains from the Avid acquisition which added significant sales with minimal additional overhead. Finally, factor number seven is our strong record of free cash flow conversion. We have quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion as a percentage of net income was 120.1%, which was best-in-class in the consumer package goods industry. As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow in the first quarter. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain, including construction of more efficient new plants, and the acquisition of leading brands. All of these factors give me great confidence of our ability to deliver our aggressive 2013 business targets despite the very tough business environment facing all companies these days. In my biased opinion, no other consumer packages company is as well-suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment. We were delivering exceptional earnings per share growth before the recession, we are delivering exceptional earnings per share growth during this slow economic recovery, and we are taking actions to ensure that we continue to deliver exceptional EPS growth going forward, regardless of the future economic environment. Let me switch gears now and specifically talk about our outlook for the rest of 2013. As stated in the press release, as a result of the fact that our first quarter results were very strong, we remain confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate of $2.79, which is an increase of 14% over 2012 adjusted EPS. We believe that we can deliver this aggressive EPS target despite continued expected headwinds from weak consumer demand. Our confidence to deliver this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors. First, we believe that we can deliver the market share gains in our power brands required to deliver our target of 3% to 4% organic growth. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, specific in distribution gains across the majority of our power brands, and strong marketing support. Second, we now believe that we continue to deliver gross margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points in our total business in 2013, including the new Avid acquisition. We previously believe that our gross margin for the total business will be flat versus year ago, as gross margin improvement on the pre-Avid business will be offset by the lower-margin Avid business. The higher projected gross margin will now enable us to increase marketing spending on our power brands versus year ago to deliver the stronger share gains that we need to offset the weaker-than-expected category trends. This will enable us to ensure delivery of our 3% to 4% net revenue growth target and very aggressive 14% earnings per growth -- earnings per share growth target. In conclusion, 2013 is shaping up to be another very challenging year due to the weak consumer demand. But when things get tough, you should place your bets in the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage their portfolio to deliver strong EPS growth. This ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ian Gordon, S&P Capital IQ.
Ian J. Gordon - S&P Equity Research: Yes, I guess, I just wanted to ask, you gave some color on the Avid market shares, I think, and maybe it has gone a little bit fast, the contribution to sales in the quarter was, I think, 12.8%, a tad lighter than it was in Q4. Would that be seasonality or any potential slowdown? And can you give any color and sort of the underlying year-over-year growth rates that Avid's experiencing as we think about how that will contribute over the first 12 months, and then as it goes into organic sales?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, the fourth quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the 4 quarters of the year for the vitamin business, and no, there's no slowdown year-over-year in Q1. So we called double-digit growth rate for Avid for 2013 versus 2012. And we're well on track for that, not only in the first quarter, but for the full year. And the comment with respect to consumption being up 38%, remember, that excludes the club class of trade which is obviously a significant piece of the business as well. You may recall, when we announced the acquisition, that we had 4 customers that accounted for about 3 quarters of the sales, and club Costco would be one of them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stevie [ph], Crédit Suisse.
Unknown Analyst: Jim, can I ask a follow-up question on your comments with regards to the laundry segment. You made references in the past to increase distribution of the laundry brands, in particular, gaining more shelf space. To what extent was that a driver at the moment behind the continued growth despite the weaker category growth that you mentioned?
James R. Craigie: Well, Michael, in the first quarter, it had very minimal effect. Most of the distribution gain occurred right at the end of the first quarter, and in fact, it's still occurring early in the second quarter. So the second quarter though, much bigger impact from that than the first quarter, and then even a little bit more in the third quarter when the full distribution is out with all the accounts. So as I said in my presentation, this is the biggest year of distribution increases in my 9-year history here. And it reflects the retailers adding shelf space for our brands because of their very strong and continuous share growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere, RBC Capital Markets.
Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I guess I want to talk a little bit about the cost of doing business, because one of the common themes we've heard during earnings season is that driving that top line is costing a little bit more than usual. The big dog, as you refer to them, is saying the promotional environment has not really changed and we're hearing otherwise. So I guess, one, I wanted to see if you can just flush out a little bit more about sampling, promotional spending that's out there, with innovation, and obviously, without innovation? And then second, how do you feel about your cost savings program in order to drive some, I guess, for reinvestment back into the marketing line? So I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color on that first.
James R. Craigie: Well, Jason, I would tell you, our cost-saving program have been a long part of the history of this company and it's a terrific program. I mean, we're already looking at cost-saving programs 3 years out right now and working and planning on them. So this isn't some sort of new culture at Church & Dwight, this has been part of our culture for a long time. As far as you said, you've, I think, made comments about the pricing environment out there or the activity out there. I would say we're seeing maybe a little uptick in the merchandising activity out there by some competitors, but nothing significant.
Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, secondarily, I mean, when you look at your price mix, it was negative in the quarter. So as we think going forward, is that going to be -- I mean, just how much is that going to have to increase though in order to keep driving the volume? Do you feel comfortable that it's going to be just a modest uptick or is this just more of what we've seen just out there?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Hey, Jason, this is Matt. Historically, our organic growth rate has been driven by volume. And as you point out, in the first quarter, we had a 2.4% volume growth and 40 basis points of that negative price mix. Remember, that 2.4% is also adjusted, at least, impacted by that 1% SAP adjustment which though is appropriate. But we do expect, going forward in the future, that volume is again going to be driving our results. The only business has had been hurt on a volume basis, historically, has been our specialty products business, that's driven more by price than volume. But on the consumer side, both domestic and international, we expect volume will continue to be the driver of organic growth, consistent with the past.
Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just the last question and I'll hop off. When you talk about the marketing spending for the year, and obviously, you have the step-up you're doing on Avid as well. I mean, can you talk a little bit about in terms of the second quarter, because again, similar to what we saw in the first quarter, I think street expectations are coming down because I think you guys are talking more about the marketing spend this quarter, thankfully, you guys came in better than expected. So I guess I'm trying to contextualize the marketing spend in this quarter. When you say significant, how significant? And then for the full year, are we thinking about marketing spending that's back at 2011 levels?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Okay. Well, in the first quarter, the marketing expense was 10.1% of sales, and that's up 30 basis points year-over-year. So I wouldn't characterize 30 basis points as significant as an increase year-over-year. So obviously, Q2 is going to be significantly greater than that on a year-over-year basis. And remember that our historical algorithm as a company is that as we expand gross margin, we spend it back on the marketing line. So just as we held our EPS call for the year, yet we're saying that on a full year basis, we're going to have 25 to 50 basis points expansion gross margin. At the same time, you would expect then that the marketing line would again expand at a similar rate on a full year basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello, Oppenheimer.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to start with category growth. You mentioned, I think, earlier, that of your 13 domestic categories, 7 were down in dollars. So just kind of back to the envelope, it sounds like you're assuming roughly flat category growth this year. I'm just trying to put that 3% to 4% organic growth into some context, that's all.
James R. Craigie: Yes, Joe, honestly, we don't have an exact prediction of category growth going out there. I'll just tell you, we're doing everything possible to drive category growth because I told you, 7 of our 13 categories we track were down in the first quarter, and that's 6 of the 8 of our power brand categories. So it's something that concerns us. So the good news is that we're going to be launching -- the innovative new products we launched were terrific and we're going to be increasing marketing spending behind it. I would say the early signs are terrific. We mentioned, on gummy vitamins are -- consumption growth was 38%, and that's supporting an 8% category growth. Tooth Tunes had a first quarter consumption growth of 12%, which is helping drive its category up 12%. Orajel's single-dose cold sore was up 45% consumption in the first quarter, that helped its category grow 16%. In the Oxiclean Dishwashing Booster, another one of our major new products, has now achieved a 10% share in its first year, and it's helping drive a 10% category growth. So we are very concerned about the environment out there with consumers and the anemic category stuff and we view it as our role to launch innovative new products and support them with strong marketing support and get these categories growing. And also, I didn't mention, our biggest one of all is our effort on liquid laundry detergent. We're launching a new Ultra Power laundry detergent product, that's the new next level of concentrate, we call it 4X, terrific product, it's a win-win-win across-the-board. It's a win for consumers, it's easier to handle for consumers in store, and it's environmentally friendly. It's more versatile than PODs, but our consumers going to adjust the usage to loads, both big and small, they can also pretreat with it, and it's a better value. We're giving consumers 20% more loads in the product. It's a win for retailers, they get reduced distribution costs, higher shelf return on investment. It's a win for manufacturers, it's lower distribution cost and packaging. Again, this in the liquid category, which is 77% of the laundry detergent market out there. And we know from history, liquid compaction's a proven winner. The last run of compaction liquid laundry detergent drove the category up 5%. Currently, you've heard from folks at Clorox, the current bleach compaction's driving their category up 6%. So this is something we want to really pound behind, early results are very promising. We just started launching this product in late Q1. We got great distribution that was incremental to our existing laundry detergent line. Early, early, early sales results are promising and it looks like it's driving incremental sales. So we're taking the lead here to get growth going to Liquid Laundry Detergent category, which was down 10% in the first quarter. And that's a not a good number on 77% of the category to be down 10%. So we're taking the lead on the next round of concentration that we got a great product that will be a winner for everybody out there and maybe our competition will wake up and follow our lead.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. Good. Because that's where I was going next, the liquid laundry category. It looks like -- it seems like there's a lot of confusion because you've got base detergent, you've got unit dosing and you've got a compacted version now out there in the category. So is it more that the consumer's confused or that you're not seeing the level of overdosing with the proliferation of unit dose now?
James R. Craigie: No, I would tell you, Joe, it's a little bit of good news and bad news. The bad news is that PODs is clearly driving the decline in the laundry category, and the second big factor is the price decline by our friends in Cincinnati in powder. The good news is that PODs penetration of laundry has flattened out at 8%. It was 8% in Q4 of last year, and it's 8% in Q1 of this year. Other piece of good news is we'll shortly be lapping the launch of PODs, that was started in Q2, Q3 last year. And so that will -- that impact would be behind us. And we feel proud of the fact that our laundry detergent, liquid laundry detergent brand, ARM & HAMMER, was the only one that launched a unit dose form that didn't suffer lower sales going out there. So we feel we're in good position, we're glad, hopefully, that POD impact is shortly behind us. And again, we're going forward to focus on something that brings attention back to the liquid category, which is 77% of the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz, Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: If you look at the Nielsen data, it looks like sales kind of accelerated throughout the quarter. And then, the latest April data looks actually really good. So what's driving that and does that trend kind of continue? I mean, when did Walmart come in with new shelf space? Lou should be really proud of the way that set looks, and is that helping the incremental sales also? How should we kind of read forward on that acceleration as the quarter progresses?
James R. Craigie: Well, Bill, as we kind of said, the new distribution and the new products both came on very late in Q1. So yes, I do think you're seeing a little bit of acceleration of our share results and some sales results. Then again, merchandising's lumpy. Sometimes, you have a lot of merchandising in one month and then a month, you don't have it, then a month, back. So it's somewhat of a combination of the new distribution of new products and new merchandising. And yes, we've had some very, very strong results in April, but that doesn't mean it's going to be every month like that. But overall, we feel very confident now that, that will deliver the 3% to 4% sales growth that we have. And that's -- in the old days, that would've been an okay number, but when you're doing 3% to 4% against category growth that's really basically flat, that's even a more terrific result.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And then, Matt, when you look at the gross margin change versus your previous guidance, is that more the base business or is Avid's gross margin coming in better than you thought?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, the base business is starting off really well, there's no doubt about that. And it's also true that Avid is improving faster than we thought. With respect to Avid, just to kind of refresh your memory, we had targeted $15 million of synergies by mid-2014. And that synergies, those were both COGS and SG&A. Now the thinking right now is that we still see $15 million. Well, we feel really good about $15 million by mid-2014. But $9 million of that is going to be in 2013, $6 million in '14. And the way that, that would split out is the $9 million this year, I think, half and half, half is COGS, and half is SG&A. And then in 2014, that $6 million would be all COGS.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And how much have you gotten so far?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Oh, as you know, we don't -- for competitive reasons, we don't talk about gross margins with respect to our brands and products.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Is it more or less than $9 million?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: It's less than $9 million. And the other thing too, with respect to gross margin and thinking about the second quarter, we're up gross margin Q1 110 basis points, and marketing was up 30. So you can expect that the reverse is going to happen in the second quarter. So gross margin's not going to up as much, but marketing is going to be up quite a bit. And the impact there is, as Jim pointed out, we've got some super new distribution, so we got higher slotting, that'll happen in the Q2. And then we have lots of couponing going on as well behind our new products as well. So that's kind of -- Q2's kind of an inverse of Q1.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy, CLSA
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I just hopped on the call, so I don’t know which questions have been asked or not because there's an overlap with Estee. But did you already elaborate on the laundry business?
James R. Craigie: Yes, we did.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Ferrara, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Can you, I guess, clarify a little bit, the strategy on concentration? So on this new round of compaction that you guys are running. Do you guys need this to end up driving another round of traditional compaction? Or is this product, you kind of happily have this product exist as sort of a niche product that maybe you can gain -- you have gained incremental shelf space, but maybe you gain a little bit more. Like how do you think about it over the long term, does it need to drive another round?
James R. Craigie: Chris, our desire would be we'd drive another round of compacting all liquid laundry detergent products out there. Again, that was a huge proven winner 4-plus years ago, drove the category up, and it's a great win. I mean, it's great for the environment, it's great for sustainability, as they call it. So the consumer wins, the environment wins, the retailer wins by saving money on distribution costs and gets better shelf return to get more bottles on the shelves, so we're fewer out of stocks. And in this case though, in this case, something new, as we passed some of the savings on to consumers, we put 20% more loads in the bottle. So consumers, the size getting easier to handle in store and helping the environment, less waste out there, they get 20% more loads. So this does drive the category out there, and consumers do love liquid, it's still 77% of the business, they can adjust how they use liquid, you can't adjust the PODs, you can pre-treat with it, you can -- it only makes sense, consumers have little loads, big loads, heavily soiled, lightly soiled, you can't -- we have the versatility of liquid out there. So we're trying to bring the attention back to the big dog in the category, which is liquid, and do something which we think will be good for, again, the consumer, the retailer and the manufacturers in this category. And we're taking the lead to show everybody and hopefully everybody else will realize this, they should, history proves it, the bleach guys are proving it right now out there, that's been a win-win-win. And so we decided to take the lead even though we're not the big guy in the category.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And I guess, I mean, is it realistic to think something like that could happen while unit dosing is running its course? And I guess, as a follow-up to that, like at an 8% share, where do you think retailers are? And I know you had the view that retailers are going to kind of look up and see that the category growth rate is suffering. Do you still think that 8% is too small and this product will go by the wayside and do you need that to happen for anyone to realistically think about another run at compaction?
James R. Craigie: No, no. PODs is here to stay. But as I told you earlier, it's flattened out. It was 8% in Q4, it's 8% of Q4 last year, and 8% of this year. So it's serves the need, it's a nice product, all the major brands have their version of PODs. So it's out there. I will tell you, it's over-shelved, it's about 20% of the shelf space, so I think retailers ought to bring it back to about 8% of the shelf, in line with its reach onto the marketplace. And just go forward, it's been a nice little addition to the category, but it's only 1/2 the size of powder, about -- almost 1/9 the size of liquid. So let's put the focus back in the category and most of the big part of the category is to get this category growing again.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then just trying to like -- with Procter bringing on new capacity in PODs and probably likely to launch another flurry of promotion and advertising in that, just for the format of unit dosing to begin with, I mean, would you -- you got to think that 8% is going to go higher, no?
James R. Craigie: Well, Chris, I don't understand something. 2 years ago, they predicted this category, this PODs will be 30% of the category, 2 years later, it's 8%. So why are they out of capacity?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell, SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just to start off, looking at the commodity outlook and kind of what you're seeing now, maybe where you're hedged and what ability you have with, I would think, more tamed commodity environment to be -- do any additional pricing this year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, Bill, we have -- there are 8 inputs that account for most of the volatility in our COGS. And we're 65% hedged at this point. And I think most people know that commodity headwinds have abated. So I think that's one of the reasons why if you look at what's happened to us in Q1, that lot of our productivity efforts have dropped through because we have less of a commodity headwind. And so going forward, certainly, for the remainder of the year, we're not expecting that commodities are going to restart to climb higher. And as everybody's read, that a lot of people think the big cycle on commodities could be ending.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And then in terms of looking at the gross margin, you may have touched upon this, but do you expect gross margin to be up every quarter? And was there any incremental benefit this quarter from just timing of slotting fees year-over-year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, second quarter is what's going to be impacted by slotting and couponing, Bill. So what I said earlier is that in the first quarter, gross margin's up 110 basis points. And we don't expect the second quarter to be nearly up that amount because of slotting and couponing behind the new products and the distribution, et cetera. As far as calling each quarter individually, a little bit too early to do that.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just last one. I think, it sort of in these past 2 or 3 years, you've kind of made some movements with your cash balance in the first quarter, be it a share repurchase or stepping up the dividend or what have you. Is the thought now, post Avid, you want to just kind of build up the cash balance for a while and look at other acquisitions or would you look to do other things at these levels?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, when we announced our earnings in the first week of February, we raised the dividend, so we're committed to maintaining a 40% payout. At the same time, we generating lots and lots of cash here, so we did pay down $50 million of our debt. But as you know, we expect to generate $400 million-plus of free cash flow on an annual basis. So we are always in the hunt for new acquisitions. As you know, we're not regarded as a shopper, but we're regarded as a buyer. It's kind of we are aware just about everything that does come to the market. And we continue to look, but we wouldn't comment on any activity that we're engaged in with respect to M&A.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman, Barclays.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just wanted to talk about marketing spending. So first off, does it surprise -- in the quarter, because I thought just simply the mix of having Avid in the P&L would make marketing expenses look like they were lower the percentage of sales, and yet they were up. So did you increase on the base business that much this quarter or was it just you started already accelerating the spend on Avid? That's one. And then 2, on the same topic is just, the last couple of years, this gross margin was a little tougher because of commodity cost, on a flip side, was trimming marketing, and top line held up great, clearly wasn't an actual issue, but that is the dynamic we saw on the P&L. This year, you're going to do the reverse. So I guess what's the incremental benefit you're thinking you'll get from the higher marketing spending while the top line's already been so solid with you kind of pulling it back to lower level?
James R. Craigie: Lauren, this is Jim. Let me take the second one first. You're exactly right, we're now showing gross margin improvement. And as Matt said, we'll be spending back roughly 1/2 of that of the marketing line, so increased our marketing support. Old days, you would say, that would help in that revenue line, but what we're facing now that we haven't faced before is weaker categories. So with the weaker categories, we need to be spending more money to get to our 3% to 4%, or in the past, that wasn't absolutely necessarily to get there. So that's the story on that one. As far the A&P on Avid, we have increased it, but no, we've spent more on the base business, that's helped out. So Avid is going to increase, we doubled the spending on that business, so it was pretty low before we got it, but we're going to get it up in the double-digit range on that to drive its sales.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then just quickly on unit dose. I know I missed most of the conversation, I think, on laundry. But I was curious if you think there's much substitution going on that maybe some of the drag you're seeing in your powder business is people switching to your unit dose product because your unit dose looks and smells like powder in a capsule. And that maybe some of it is just cannibalization within your own portfolio. Does that make sense?
James R. Craigie: No. Yes, it does. I can see where you could make sense of it. But it's a good question. 90% of our business -- of the unit dose sales are coming from liquid, which is more in line with the fact that liquid's 77% of the category. So our results, market research, show it's highly cannibalistic of the liquid business for all manufacturers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley, Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I apologize if you've given out some of these numbers, so you said your categories have slowed, what is their growth this year versus maybe what it was last year and what is the category growth for detergents overall? And when do you think detergents growth gets better?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Alice, we quoted the fact that 7 of our 13 categories were down in the first quarter. We don't really call a number on the year, we just feel in our hearts that given where the economy is going, we're not going to see much improvement out there in the categories and that's the reason behind, with the gross margin improvement, we're going to be spending back about 1/2 of that to help drive stronger share gains and the share gains will help us get to the 3% to 4% revenue growth out there. In liquid, the liquid -- the laundry detergent category overall, liquid powder unit dose was down about 4% in the first quarter, liquid was down 10%, so not a good situation going on. And as I've told some people, we're going to be working hard with spending more money in the category and launching the new Ultra Power form, which is the next concentrated form to try to get the focus back on the 77% of the business, which is liquid, and drive better results in that category.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: In the second quarter, could you tell us what your share was, up or down in the first quarter, and then how much you think it will be up, I'm hoping, in the second quarter? And what will drive that the most, will it be the concentrate, will it be the incremental shelf space? What drives your share change into the second quarter?
James R. Craigie: I don't have the -- both ARM & HAMMER and XTRA shares were up in the first quarter, a couple of tenths. And I can't give you that -- I think it was 9.1% in ARM & HAMMER and I don't remember the exact number on XTRA. In the second quarter, we will drive our business, there's a combination of things, Alice. We do a more distribution out there in a lot of major retailers and we have the new products out there in the form of the Ultra Power. So we expect that to drive some continued strong share gains. I'm not going to call a number, but we do -- we expect share gains -- we need the share gains to help deliver our -- the business results we expect.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And do you think it's the incremental shelf space that's helping more or the innovation?
James R. Craigie: Both.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen, William Blair.
Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Sorry if this has already been discussed, I just jumped on. I wanted to ask about the international business, which strengthened from a top line standpoint on a tougher comp in the quarter. Just a little more color on where you're seeing strength there, what's driving that? And how you're thinking about the organic sales growth for the full year in that part of the business?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Our international business historically has grown in a similar fashion as the domestic business. We have a 3% to 4% algorithm and they've been able to meet or exceed that historically every year. The businesses that are doing well in the quarter are 3 countries. One is the U.K., there is Mexico and the third is Australia. I'll start with Mexico since that is probably the biggest winner. We've been making great inroads down there with respect to our household products within ARM & HAMMER south of the border. In Australia, Australia has historically been our fastest growing business, and if you look at any of our prior year earnings releases, you'll see Australia is almost always one of the drivers and we got some terrific products over there. Curash is a local brand that's been growing year after year which is a children's rash brand, as you could probably guess. And finally, the U.K., U.K. has some success with respect to pricing and pulling back some trade spend without losing any of our volume. And by the way, you're probably also familiar with the Batiste brand, which is the dry shampoo, which we bought over in the U.K. And it's been growing very, very rapidly and continues to drive results in the U.K.
Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: That's the one that's about 6% share of the hair care category, is that right?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: That's correct.
Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And second question, just on Victorville, is where are we in terms of the benefit from that facility in terms of gross margin? I mean, have you hit kind of run rate in that plant or is there more to come there?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: I think, there's more to come out in Victorville. But generally, we build the plant, this plant has been going full blast since July of 2012. So once you get into a full year, you're pretty much rocking. And we have put more capacity in there and it's to the extent that we're able to leverage our fixed cost, it'll obviously drive our gross margin.
Operator: And there's no further questions at this time. Sir, do you have any closing remarks?
James R. Craigie: I just want to thank everybody for taking the time to listen to our call today. And like I said in my first opening, I'm very proud of my company, we had a great quarter, and we're looking forward to having a great year. So thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-05 12:30:00) =====
Executives: James Craigie - Chairman and CEO Matthew T. Farrell - EVP & CFO
Analysts:  [Call Starts Abruptly]  This was what this floor is made for in a refreshner economy, which we have been in from about 2008, this was the case of the laundry category, more and more users are shifting from the premium mid-tier price points for the Value and Extreme Value price points. In fact as of little past year or so, the Value category is now growing bigger than the mid price category, which you can see on this chart and encroaching up on the premium category soon. In fact more households, you look at actual households, more households use a Value detergent than a mid or premium price detergent and its growing, and we’ve got share results. As you can see we have just steadily every year gained a point or two of the total fair of the total laundry category. We are now almost 15%. As you will see Church & Dwight has grown over the last three years, we’ve gained 300 share points, everybody else has lost and now we’ve past Sun as the number two company in America on pure dollar share basis. If you look at the Value segment, we are by far the biggest player in the Value segment, over 50% of the segment; we’ve gained eight share points within the Value players. We are now bigger than the number two, three and four players combined. You can look at the total Washload. This is what people actually use in their household. How many Washloads are our products versus other products, they give us some liquid dollars because those are just purely what they use in the Washload, you can see we have increased the number of Washloads in the American household between 2009 and 2012 and we are far closer to Procter on total Washloads than we are of a dollar basis and growing. Every player well in 2013 will expect continued strong growth of our laundry business plans of 2013. First of all we have achieved some major distribution gains on our two products across major North American accounts. So we’re going to be growing the shelf across all these accounts. Now, I know some of you are workshop analysts will ask me questions as to which accounts and the answer is we’re not going to tell you. For competitive reasons we’re not going to name those things these things are happening as we speak by the way this is the pitch of the three analysts will have a hold on our stock anyway. There are no details you’re going to ask me 100 times and you could tell you accounts what timing whatever. I would simply tell, I still try a little around on distribution across all of our products within 2009, 2012. I will simply tell you in 2013 in our laundry business we probably have the biggest amount of distribution gains than we've ever had in our business and by the way we deserve this because of our share growth the distribution have to keep catching up with our share gains and this is not as we've got something we deserve we totally deserve this because we grew our share of net products, so I showed you so much. And we have some great new products coming around next year for both ARM & HAMMER and Xtra that will help drive increase sales along with that increased distribution. And Xtra, this is a brand that provides great value to consumer. This brand is about a third of the price of the premium brands. We put a dimension on how big Xtra is? Xtra share is – got a highest cubic share ever in the fourth quarter of 6.4, how big is that? Some you may not know this. That is bigger than P&G’s Era and Sheer combined. That’s bigger than West House Son and Width combined. So Xtra is a big brand and we’re launching two great new fragrances on this in 2013. This brand is very much driven by its fragrance and deo and so we are launching two great new fragrances to help drive this brand. Big news today folks. This is ARM & HAMMER ultra power, we’re leading the way in the liquid laundry category on concentration. This is a win for everybody out there. The consumer wins in this case because we’re improving value we’re offering 20% more lows along with the downsized version here with less water in it, improving performance, this product is 50% whiter and 50% fresher. As a product the smaller bottle which you get a compaction is easier for handling and storage. That is environment friendly because its less weight. And the consumer to control the dosage and I’ll talk about that in a second. The retail wings on this one the bottles are small they can ship more per truck so they save lots of money on their transportation cost. They can fit more bottles on the shelves. So see you a lot of stock and higher and one of the best fit and drives category growth. And we are watching the product incrementally to our base business today and only will walk into retail seeking incrementally – we just result them. There sponsor has been extremely positive. Why are we doing the next around of compaction from you would say because it is a little bit of risky going from bigger bottles to smaller bottles this is why we’re doing it. If you look at the last amount of compaction which has happened over 2006 to 2007 as a world out across the country and then you look at it in the 12 month after it was fully out there going into 2008, 2009 compactions rolled a 5% gain in the total laundry category, big improvement, which I think fully liquid laundry category, everything right in the first place leave my own side that was big that’s big growth.  You might say well isn’t positive during that or something we call unit dose. The answer is absolutely not. Consumers use less laundry detergents when they switch from liquid or powder to unit dose. You can see on this chart that as unit dose sales versus the total category, this was reported by Nielsen, all channels which captures 90% of retail consumption out there for all manufacturers involved with it. Unit dose has grown, since it started the numbers versus year ago, you can see growth of $22 million over a year ago to $140 million. But you can see down for the laundry category, which is liquid, powder and unit dose, all three forms, incremental in Q1, but in Q2 as the biggest player, I know this category has started pushing unit dose. You can see the total detergent category has lost more and more and more sales. Unit dose is hurting the laundry detergent category. Compaction will help the laundry detergent categories, we last did it and that’s by we are leading the effort and hopefully the other manufacturers will get the news and follow us. I was very pleased to hear yesterday Clorox doing around a compaction in bleaches. Smart move for all the same reasons we are doing it. All right so we are on the (TV) product portfolio, part premium, part value, which is really helping to drive great sales in especially recessionary time, but also great times too. Number two we know how to build our powder brand share. I’ll talk about we have eight powder brands as you can see in this charts. Those eight powder brands represent 80% of our sales and profits. Those were the eight powder brands there, the number one in every category or a major product and leading households like ARM & HAMMER, which connects about many categories. (Inaudible), we think there is no secret to this, this should be every brand in America, but we have very innovative products that I would tell you I think our innovation pipeline is as good or better than any other CPG company out there. We’ve increased our marketing spending, we’ve increased our distribution in to those three things and you build your share on your brands. Let me talk about new product series. The major news today coming across, I think first of all the major new products on our existing platforms today, in a second I will talk about some wide space categories, and the joining categories. These are some of our new products, I talked a minute ago about XTRA, just repeating that slide. I talked a minute ago about Ultra Power, big new news leading the way out there and the next one is compaction. Let’s move to Cat Litter, Cat Litter we had massive new launch to XTRA called Ultra Last, it’s the number one new Cat Litter launch since 2005 and this year we are going to grow it even further by launching a larger size expansion to 2013. Pure Ecstasy and TROJAN, this is the next new form of TROJAN going out there. We’ve had a great success line. I will show you more in a second on that. It is a revolutionary new patented design that makes you feel like nothing is there and it’s an Ultrasmooth lubricant going with it. Nair Spa Clay Trio, wash and launch Nair Spa Clay product individual product, this we are combining them into a package called Trio, so you get in one little package how to prepare your skin, how to remove the hair and how to moisturize the skin all at once. Now to White Space, turning over to big White Space categories we are going into which we think will help drive very significant growth for our company. These categories are big, manual toothbrush $800 million category, Cold Sore $200 million category dishwashing additives 140, Sexual lubricants $250 million category. Last year we launched late last year Tooth Tunes proprietary technology we actually acquired from the Hasbro Company. This product we launched in the second half of the year. This product is doing awesome already achieved a 16% share of kids battery toothbrushes. In this case, proprietary technology only we can do and I’ve always said jokingly but true if we had children we yell at all the time to brush their teeth at night you have to yell it from stop brushing their teeth when they have Tooth Tunes and the music is playing in their head. Big new news here folks we have the exclusive bright news for our musical toothbrush form the One Direction brand now the old timer is going to say who the heck is One Direction, for those of you have young kids they’re going to say oh my god One Direction this is the hottest boys brand in the world. They sold over 23 million singles albums and DVDs last year they were named Billboard MTV’s Top Artist for 2012 their world tour for 2013 is already been sold out and they got a movie coming out in August of this year. This is as hot as it gets and we’re launching two brushes with two of them are the favorite songs on them (inaudible) those are you going home tonight with especially young girls in the family are going to be very curious when you bring this product home tonight its shipping as we speak and your kids will be the first once in America to have this product. Cold Sore, Matt mentioned we had some issues on the oil gel – private label, we’re dealing with that on the core business. Last year we launched a new product called Cold Sore treatment. Again it’s a some patent technology this product is incredible it’s always in the top 10 SKUs in the Cold Sore category. I tell if you have friends have some cold sore tell them to use this product. The competitive product that’s been out there has – users over seven straight days and it only stops healing by about six or seven hours. This product is one application healing stuffs immediately its incredible I swear to you tell your friends about Cold Sore, given this product they will thank you. Dishwashing additives another thing we started last year, we’re going to span out this year our Oxiclean Dishwashing Booster with the number one new product in the dishwashing additives category. Again we launched it late last year. As I told to you straight back then dishwashing products, they get phosphate out of the product last year but the government phosphates and great cheap cleaners that help make your glasses sparkle they had to take it out they haven’t quite found replacements for that. We've launched this product to help you store the cleaning power of dishwashing products. It is DD additives category since we was launched 58% of the growth was due to our product, we've achieved a 10% market share in year one. And we’re spending on that in a year or two by launching a larger size of not even value of consumers. Huge news, our company which is the owner of TROJAN brand the number one sex brand in America is launching a line of lubricants next year. The lines that we call TROJAN Crazy Sexy Feel. We’re going to do a (mimine) to this category with the X brand end of the ordering category. There is going to be great excitement in this category which it needs. And we have a huge competitive advantage we’re going to be launching samples of this in the millions and millions of boxes of condoms that we fill so we’re going to be putting again wait it to the hands of people out there to enjoy. You can see lubricant category is very attractive on a totally North American basis you can see condoms is about $500 million basis lubricants about half that size. The category is actually kind of stop to declining because of the lack of the news and we’re going to fix that and the margin of this business are very high. Why the people use lubricants, its not a myth out there, which need to dispelled. A lot of people believe lubricants are just used for older women they’re just for only to fix the problem that’s not true. We've done extensive studies with major universities out there and found out lubrications are critical components and great effect our lubricants are used mainly for pleasure, fun and comfort and lubricants use fulfills want the needs of across a wide range of users and situations. You know folks that’s the mainstream acceptance in this country, the Fifty Shades of Grey book is the moving seller for the past two weeks, the movie is coming out in 2014. So we want to take TROJAN and make it our next great mega brand in this country after the ARM & HAMMER mega brand. We want to become the leading brand in three major sexual health segments, we already own a 66) share of the common business in North America we want the become a leading premium brand n the vibration market in North America and want to become the leading premium brand in the $250 million lubricant market. You can we (inaudible) uncommon through great innovations that we launched over last few years and achieve sheer growth again this is across from three countries and doing extremely well. Lubricants and vibrators have to understand are helping to extend our franchise as this chapter shows that’s age of consumers on the bottom the show for condoms – use of condoms declines over age. Youths and vibes don’t. they stay very high usage in overall age group. So this is really going to bring great growth and strength for the TROJAN business force for launching in these businesses. We combine through seconds, interesting fact about just make you very popular your next cocktail party your neighborhood. There are two types more people use vibrator, 30% use condoms, 53% of adult women and 46% of adult men have used the vibrator sometime in their life. So that we say when an adult women and men have used it with their partner that will surprise you and get this one 56% of women and 59% of men who have never used a vibrator before believe that a vibrator use is a healthy part of a women’s sex life where as people have used (inaudible) 95% believe that so this category has a lot of outside opportunity. We've now with a full line of vibrators on the marketplace and last year we did am interesting little test, we decided to give away vibrators in New York City to find out how much people appeal to it improves the reach out in America that everybody wants vibrators. On the first day we did in August 9, we launched in New York City and we have hires that announced it and we have people lined up over five blocks more and waiting for a free vibrator to the point where Bloomberg said its folks that didn’t us down in front page of New York Post the next day (inaudible). Well, next day we got the license to come back out and do it from the city we did down on the meat packing district we’re not stupid.  And you can see the lines again, lining up before that and the people loving it, we give away almost 10,000 free vibrators and it was extremely popular. We since rolled that out last year to Chicago and Boston, had equally incredible results. This year we are going to roll up 15 more cities and drive extended retail distribution, there is the picture down there in Washington, in front of the Washington monument; again we are very careful how we choose our sites show the symbolism behind them and have great success. So if you want to actually put it to do we will give you the cities and the timeframe, so you can meet all your friends across the world and fun out there. So that’s good in price, I think it again it probably the most innovative new pipeline of products that we ever had in our history entering some major new categories with exciting news. We support those increased marketing, interesting chart, we’ve never quite shown this kind of detail before. This is a chart of our total marketing spending and very carefully here this is advertising, consumer and trade dollars. We are not going to give you the details, but I am just going to show you a few additives up across the years, you can see that our spending across, out the most total three elements of what we call marketing has gone to 9% CAGR across the year. So we have been increasing our support by on great innovations. You take those two, you will grow up in sales, grow up to the retail world and you tell them, hey, we need more distribution, and we get it. This is a fascinating chart that compares between 2009 whatever we had in this brand, how does it compare that’s a 100, how to compare certainly well in 2012 and you can see just from that timeframe, which goes through the end of last year we had major gains across our brands and I would tell you in 2013 or probably the biggest year this division gained across our entire franchise out there. So when I come back here next year I will show you the 2013 results, but I can tell you right now based on what we know from what a counsel said to us in a very (inaudible) to do its going to be a terrific year in 2013. Yet all together and after the great growth in our power brands, this is the last five years our eight power brands have grown share over 75% of the time, heck of a lot more of the other companies out there who are trying to get to 50%. We’ve gone to 75% December time, again had a great year in 2012 with six of the eight growing and actually I explained to you Nair had a great year, but there was a new entry that grew the category even more than we grew, so tactically our share went down, but our sales were right here. This (inaudible) chart say well, this just shows you how we are not just one year wonders, we do it consistently. Here is share growth in ARM & HAMMER (Toothpaste) shows us 16% CAGR between 2003 and 2012. Here is ARM & HAMMER Litter, a category we entered in 1998 and had a 14% CAGR and sales force driven by tremendous innovations over that time period. OxiClean, a great brand and I will talk a bit more in a second. If you look at this brand, we bought it in 2006, but where it is today take those combined sales of the Oxi product itself and we what we co-branded with, this product is going up to 22% CAGR and we tripled the total sales of this business since we bought it 2006. First Response, I love this brand. We acquired this brand in 2001; it is a (mute) number three brand with a 12 share. Now about 11 years later we are the number one player in the marketplace with over 30 share and still growing. The bottom line we had a great year in 2012 and we exited with great momentum, on the year, six of eight power brands grew to record levels, didn’t just grow record all time levels on an annual basis and in the fourth quarter of 2012 seven of the eight grew share in the fourth quarter and those quarterly shares and half of them, a record quarterly share, so, very important to us as we exit the year with very strong momentum. Now well great portfolio, great power brands driven by innovation and marketing, distribution, but sometimes people say we got little Church & Dwight, you are only $3 billion in sales up against guidance, they get to $8 billion in sales, how do you defend yourself when you got a task? Let me show you. I have told this story before, the ending is even better than I told you before. This is the story of OxiClean. We bought this business in 2006 with a 27 share, which was the number one brand at the time. In the next three years through 2009 we grew it to 40.7 share, how we do that, like I just told you, create new products, increase the advertising significantly, but then in 2009 the player in the marketplace decided they are one of the biggest share of this business. They already had a little stain pen out there, that was a sub 10% share of the category, but they decided to come on board with also the ones that come out as hard. We didn’t sit there, we ferociously defend the business, we launched a whole line of new products, we also cobranded the product, because other products being more awareness of the OxiClean name, we increased advertising spending to make it the number two most advertised product in the entire fabric care category and the end result was that now today, our share in 2012 is actually higher than it was in 2009 when the other guy entered the category and you can see on their line, the second line down there that their share at one point reaches high as 17% to 18% of the category. They have backed down to13% of the category and are barely above where they started the business in 2009. And you can see we totally deflected all the share gain to other players in that category, so not only we are still number one, but we are growing. International, international is about 18% of our portfolio, not as much as (inaudible) but a very good piece of our portfolio. Our business is concentrated in six countries, where we have $500 million in sales, five of those six countries are doing very well. Over the five year time periods of 2012 we had good strong sales growth across those countries and even the one we are often really down about 1%. Drivers of that is not only do we have our power brand corporately in some of those countries, but we also have some very strong international power brands between RUB A535 which is the hot, icy hot brand of Canada, we have Grava, number one upset stomach brand affairs, (Therma) which is big, which is the international version of simply failing we have here, so we have some very strong power brands, number one and two in their categories out there, mostly personal care, mostly high margin and we have our corporate power, we’ve been expanding ARM & HAMMER Laundry to Canada and Mexico, Cat Litter the same, we have extended toothpaste around the world and we grow out Spinbrush around different countries. We are also acquiring some brand. We acquired the Batiste business last year in the UK for dry shampoo, doing exceptionally well, it’s a fixed share in the UK, you heard so much, we are the leading wet shampoo business the dry shampoo the leading wet shampoo business only 12 this business has grown from a four to six share in last 12 months and really a hot product and we have a process expanding this around the world. And last but not least we’re leveraging our one company strength in across all functions around the world both to drive innovation drive our marketing better and to drive all of our cost savings. And we’re proud expanding gross margin. We've told you many times in the past gross margin is the gas to our gas tank. We've had a fantastic record here between 2001 and 2012 we've increased our gross margin from 29% roughly to 44% or 1510 basis point increase. As well talking about competition the last five years Church & Dwight has by far exceeded anybody’s growth in gross margin last timeframe we’re over 500 basis points over the last five years, the next closest guy is about 200 basis points. The key drivers of that things we talked to about before what we keep doing them there is going to be very cost optimization program, good to greater, use of that famous book by Jim Collins, just our name -- it applies to what we call reformulation of products reducing packaging, reduce the number of SKUs and have got plans for more efficiently laundry compaction was a big contributor back about 2007, 2008 and hedging commodity do an excellent job of doing -- make sure we had consistent lower across the commodities. Supply chain restructuring we've got lot of capital we’re building some new plants out there to help our laundering capital businesses which are very heavy businesses so it makes it very different that our plans across the country we now have plans in the East Coast, Mid West and the West Coast the best solution chain of any laundry product out in America, so and diesel being as high as it is, the money on transportation cost they had three plants out here. Acquisition synergies I’ll talk about more in a second but we love the core high margin brands and drive a lot of out of cost out of them to make them ever more accretive to our business. And price mix, we have a principle in-house that everything we launch is new products we want the gross margin equal to or higher than the other products in the line that’s launched. I mentioned acquisition we have a great track record in acquisitions very clear guidelines we try to follow in every case so we primarily want number one or two share brand. I am firm believer that anything below that is a bread that’s in trouble and with some possible turnaround so we want leading brands we want higher growth brands higher margin brands, we want to act that like that means we got to love to pick up headquarters and plan something like that we will have some competitive advantage. But we don’t like to otherwise, we want to leverage our capital base in manufacturing logistics and purchasing and we want businesses we believe over the long-term with sustainable competitive advantages so we can grow their share and sales. Here is our track record you can see a little past 12 years our businesses and I mentioned really Matt said it too, we have eight power brands seven of those eight brands we acquired that I was questioned earlier what is new Avid acquisition will be nice power brand and it is so Avid -- presentations going forward that’s going to become our next power brand. We quickly integrate these acquisitions and quickly grow their shares you can see on all these acquisitions how much we have grown shares over time very solid consistent record . Let me talk about Avid for one second those of you have heard it before this is the fantastic acquisition. This is the acquisition the very fast growing category called vitamins, mineral supplements. And we have the most unique and hottest product in that category by acquiring this company. And this is the business I mean vitamins, minerals supplements what a category I mean you know in our world today historically 3% to 4% growing category was good now most categories are growing 0% to 2%, decent business is going to steadily very single -- mid to high single digit growth rates and those growth rates are doing to continue as this increased focus on health and fitness in this country is the population ages above the mineral supplement categories continue very strong growth rates. Interesting split here very big difference from kid’s category to adult category. The kid’s vitamin business is only about $200 million category adults are at least $3.3 billion category. Gummies in total make up over 58% of the kids business, they don’t make up 3% of the adult business. So we’re looking at adult being 16 times the size of the kid as a category and yet only 3% penetration of gummies and we believe there is tremendous upside there. Avid little critter brand is always the number one brand in the kid’s vitamin world, the Vitafusion brand which is the adult version is the number one brand, but again number one with only 3% of the total business. We do see how fast these are growing the Vitafusion the adult version on the left there because only launched in 2008 and its already through 2011 we have issued 2012 numbers that’s the 2011 already close $100 million business. The kid’s side again is the number one player there is already over $100 million business with tremendous growth rates. This little place for strength I mean think about what we do well and what I talked about already. We ship a fragmented category that’s why its opening for very strong agile competitor like Church & Dwight. We have a great track record I showed you of building the share. We have the resources this company did not have to take all their great product and their great marketing support and expand distribution. We have great internal know-how that they didn’t have and that’s the systems and packaging line from we can apply to their plans and save a lot of money. We have economies of scale they don’t have in purchasing logistics and this is a business somebody say well this is a regulated business well how we have a bunch of regulated businesses that we fully understand how to properly deal with the FDA going forward. This is going to have a great impact in our share price going forward we just acquired this business officially in October 1 and paid $650 million for it over this year and we are set to realize $15 million in cost savings I would tell you that’s right on track everything is going very well doing a great effort for my entire team and you can see down, we have talk about this few minutes – couple of minutes, we’re calling 9% EPS growth on the core business in 2009 an additional 5% EPS growth will come from the Avid acquisition. So that’s our formula there a great core business great acquisitions, great continuity to see our results. And if you haven’t tried it yet there is a sample in your goodie bag (inaudible) someone in the room here try them, I swear to you I was like most of you I had never had anything but hard pills for my vitamin, they brought this I got into it, I got in the gummies and I look forward every morning, get up in the morning and eating my gummies its just the best (strip) and we have the very best gummy in the market. I’ve tried them all many times, other guys are not as soft and chewy, not as favorable, we have the best tasting gummy vitamin out there and you’re going to be hearing a lot about that as we double the advertisement spending on this in 2013. Getting more into the math territory right now, we have best-in-class free cash flow, we kind of talked about this. You saw the tremendous growth in the cash flow over the last five years. The blue lines here are through 2011 and we had latest information on competition. You can see we are best-in-class. Nobody has done as well as we did and we've done it again, the gold line in 2012 more than 118% free cash flow conversion. Number eight something very unique by the company’s superior overhead management control. Interesting chart our revenues have increased 93% since 2004. Our headcounts increased only 15%. Now I showed you this chart in the pad, our headcount actually have been going down through last year, but in the Avid acquisition we picked up about 750 employees. So actually prior to thinking of Avid our debt employee line would have gone 3800 in the past to 3600. So making that we would have increased sales 93% and actually reduced headcount and the same time taking our EPS up 260%, but even with Avid we’re still best-in-class in the industry. Nobody has the revenue for employee that we do even picking up 730 employees. And believe me folks we do walk a lot. We don’t have a company trial, I wish I did. I don’t have a company plan I wish I did. I don’t have a golf club membership, I wish I did, but I have Church & Dwight stock, and I can buy all those things, my Church & Dwight stock because it’s not as so much. In fact lot of that things in my Church & Dwight stock and if you wanted to you go afford all those things. And then say -- Okay, Jim, great results. How do you get them, how do you keep doing it? Well we put in a new health care plan in the second next year, they have to save money, you know we spend a lot of money on a information system, we’ve got an SAP system. All that allowed us to go forward and keep our headcount down to continue to grow this business and it will help us as we keep lowering our percent of net revenue spend what we call SG&A. My expert management team in the room here today, all my lovely experts, I tried it before, I do not believe in rotating people around. I do not believe at fine desk person he is training over in sales or marketing or vice versa, makes him a better person in the future to be Jim’s replacement someday, I don’t really train 50 people be my replacement someday, there is only one of me. In the mean time I want people to become experts in their functions and they are -- my age strategic business views leaders have been in their current jobs at least five years, they have an average of 23 years of experience in the industry that pays off, our eight power brands I showed you, have grown category growth 30 out of 40 times in the last five years. We've been able to minimize headcounts because they don’t need extra people to help, in fact they can reduce people because they know the business so well, that is also in the execution, everybody knows each other, they know what they doing they have been doing over three years, its great and then execution is one of the great hallmarks of Church & Dwight and we're able to absorb big one, big one, absorb acquisitions without adding out incremental headcount. My people actually beg me, they are kind of somewhat bored running the same business over again they say give me new brands, give me your businesses and we can bring out business out without adding lot of additional headcount s. (Figures) one to nine we will end up with a fact that we are total shareholder returns junkies. We have had an incredible decade of growth, tripling sales, gross margins were up, marketing spending up, SG&A only up 220 basis points, leads to great results, you can read them at operating income, EPS, adjusted free cash flow and our marketing cap in my tenure has grown $2 billion to over $8 billion, huge increase. And if you own our stock about ten years you have averaged 19.2% of the total shareholder return, which you have to make a lot of your investors out there and shareholders very happy. .There is my team, that’s actually done a year ago, February 7th to my point a second ago, there's my team. Every one of them is here today, who are in their very last year, I have been even with the same stupid tie I wore last year. Last year, I had a giants had on because the giants had just won the Super Bowl, I am not aware (inaudible) or good team, but anyway we are here about again today with all my great TSR junkies throughout this room. And folks we are 100% in the game, our bonuses are tied to 100% of business results, the business results mean the most you and all of your models out there, 25% of our bonus is now revenue, 25% of our bonus is in the gross margin expansion targets, 25% is sitting at our adjusted EPS target and 25% free cash flow. Our equity compensation is 100% stock option, that’s where you should want to hear. We are not going to get rewarded if the stock price doesn't go up. We don't have phantom stock or restrictive stock that grows in value for no improvement in stock price. We are 100% stock options. We are exactly in the same mindset you are, grow that stock price and we are required to be heavily invested. Over 80% of my net worth is in this – of this company’s stock. But trust me I watched the results every day, we broke 60 this morning. Thank you. Anyways with that I’ll let Matt come back up here and tell you more about the outlook for 2013 and the numbers.
Matthew Farrell: Okay we are going to wrap it up now. So you know our long-term algorithm for organic sales growth is 3% to 4%, we are calling that again in 2013. As I said before we have three divisions, Domestic, International and Specialty products, so all three divisions we expect to be within that range. Our gross margin, you should all think of 2013 as a reset year for us. So we just required a business that has lower than company average gross margins. So we have four quarters that I have baked into our numbers into 2013. But keep in mind as we said in our release that we expect our existing business, base business to expand its gross margin 25 to 50 basis points. One of the things too is we about 60% of our most volatile commodity hedged as of today, so it again increases our confidence and our ability to hit that number on a full year basis. And then marketing, again, it's a kind of reset year for us and we’ve got four quarters of the gummy vitamin business. As you know it had historically a lower spend as a percentage of sales. We said we are going to take that up at not as high as necessarily through our other businesses. And the thing we watch most closely is share voice versus share market. So we're very, very keen on what is been spend in a particular category and making sure that we are more than competitive with respect to our investment in our brands. And then finally EPS, so you can see we are expecting 14% EPS growth in 2013, and this is a summary page. So 3% to 4% gross margin marketing kind of flattish, but remember as I explained the acquisition had some impact on that. Lots of leverage on SG&A, so round numbers as you know, our long-term algorithm is to expand operating margin 60 basis points, so we expect to do that again in 2013, and you know the rest with our dividend increase today of 17%. We have a dividend yield of about 2%. And this actually 2012 is the 12th consecutive year that Church & Dwight has grown earnings per share of 10% or better and you see the 10 for 20 club there, so our idea there is by 2020 that we would have done it 20 years in a row. So 2013 would be the 13th year that we are shooting for. And now we are ready for questions.
James Craigie: Mr. Smith? I never knew you would need a mic, but go ahead 
Unidentified Analyst: Is there a plan to take the whole laundry portfolio to Forex concentrate at some point, so is this kind of a catastrophe how it goes and then ultimately you may want to convert the whole thing?
James Craigie: No it's not a test. We're launching this incrementally into the business, it is eventually the retailers of the world, it’s not they want everybody to go to Forex, we would be perfectly happy taking our whole line. But right now this is between the launch of an incremental effort to our current business and we think about to please consumers tremendously, please retailers and I think as a result they are hopeful the retailers will say why isn’t everything for everybody on a compacted basis.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you and did you say what retailers you are going to expand the distribution in? On the Avid business, is there a game plan to get the gross margin up above corporate averages and then can you just tell us what the business grew this year, because the market is doing pretty great relative to when you bought it, so…
James Craigie: (Inaudible).
Unidentified Analyst: Do you have a growth of the share, I know it’s not a (gag) yet, just a business from that 2011 base…
James Craigie: Double digits on the growth. That’s all I will tell you and we do have a long-term game plan to get it up over the corporate average.
Unidentified Analyst: Great thanks.
James Craigie: (Bower)
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, I don’t think in the press release was a breakout of the – what I would call non-recurring items in the first quarter tied to – could you tell us what they are in terms of inventory step up transition cost and deal cost?
Matthew Farrell:  Yeah, there actually no difference than we said previously, so…
Unidentified Analyst: The $0.06?
Matthew Farrell: So the step-up cost were about $7.5 million and transaction costs were $4.5 million. So between two of that’s $12 million, so it’s $0.05 to $0.06.
Unidentified Analyst: And so, I guess in the guidance you said that Avid would had 4% to earnings, but if you just set out its more like 2, right?
Matthew Farrell:  Yeah. We don’t think of it that way. So the way we think about it is, Avid was neutral to EPS in the fourth quarter. So, I know we can play games, and say what do we want to take in or out. But, we look at it has the EPS that Avid contributed fourth quarter is no different than if we bought on December 31. So consequently we say, we want everybody to understand this $0.13 of earnings per share in our numbers in 2013.
James Craigie: And don’t forget we told you we are going to at least double marketing spending on Avid. We really, we stepped it up a little in Q4 but really that will take starting this quarter right now. So we are going to be smoothly increase the marketing spending to drive the strong growth here. So you can use Q4 really at the base of what happened because the marketing spending hadn’t fully going to step up here – we have those step up charges and we just got in control of this business as far as distribution. But this will be a double-digit growth on revenues for us. We are going to spend some of that back in the marketing side to drive this business because we just – it’s a long-term tiger by the tail we have here. We wanted to go – we have to get out there and do well as quickly as we can.
Unidentified Analyst: How fast is the kids, vitamin part growing for you?
James Craigie:  The kids vitamin part because we are already -- the kids – gummies are already over 50% of the total kid category. We already number one. So the growth there won’t be as much as the adults because we are already a big number one player there in a category that’s already well developed. It’s growing; it will be more I will say mid-single digits. And then the adult side depending on how fast to get the distribution, how fast we drive the growth we definitely be a double digit growth category, how much will depend on, how fast we can get the distribution and spend the marketing dollars and get the trials. Because of the samples – sampling drives this business when you taste this product you are converted on the spot. So we got to do a lot of sampling progress. We will save some time. But, 2013 will be a great year to drive a lot of incremental distribution incremental sampling and then convert all these people to use this long-term especially on the adult side.
Unidentified Analyst: And do you think in your core business that detergents will grow faster than that 3% to 4%?
James Craigie:  Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: And the last part is ARM & HAMMER are extra growing faster in 2013 of the two?
James Craigie:  Well, it’s had a great year. Both are getting significant incremental distribution, both are great new product launching, we will be supporting those heavily and we had a great in 2012 fastest grower in the entire laundry category in 2012, biggest share gainer in 2012 and with what I know right now in 2013 to be another terrific year. No more, you are done. Next?
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, what do you building in for a promotional spending, I know you said there was going to be some sampling on some of the new products but just overall I know you always have a little bit of a gloomy attitude at the beginning of the year and the numbers usually come in better. So…
James Craigie:  So you are talking gummies or everything?
Unidentified Analyst: I’m talking everything.
James Craigie:  I think it’s a pretty stable comparisons building out there. I think the business environment the economy is just kind of in a lower spin. We have seen every category for the past two years about half up and half have flatter down actually they are continuing. I don’t see any difference. That’s a little optimistic you won’t believe that. I honestly think confidence in this country is starting to turn right now. And confidence always comes before the results. And if you watch what happened in the building industry is having a turnaround. And the building industry usually perceives an economy turnaround because new homes create needs for product in those homes and things like that. So I’m very encouraged to see the new home market picking up in this country and I think that will be the precursor hopefully maybe in 2014 or 2015, nothing will happen so much this year it takes time. But, I love the fact, I’m seeing confidence in the consumer environment, they are starting to build and I hope that continues. I hope double net quits putting us in a crisis mode with these fiscal cliff issues and makes – quits getting everybody else nervous because when consumers get nervous they pull back. So hopefully I can file the budget crisis and look forward and I hope the building industry they continue to improve and maybe in 2014 or 2015 we will see some improvement in the GDP. I think 2013 is another whole year right now. But, I don’t see things getting worse. I don’t see in 2013 getting better. Hopefully I can spend a year from now and hopefully the data will support the beginning – turnaround in this country. So we will see.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just on the three to four organic, I know you kind of labeled that your assumptions were aggressive but I think achievable is your quote, the three to four I guess, if you think you about you are going to get Avid into the organic sales composition.
James Craigie: No, it’s one quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: By the fourth quarter. You are getting increased distribution, you are already seeing laundry is going to grow faster than the total company. So, again, I understand that’s an ever green target. But, when you flush it out a little bit more, I mean, what could really step…
James Craigie: I said aggressive, but thinking more of the 14% EPS target nobody is going up the 14% in our industry. It’s a tough competitive environment, we got a lot step go out there and we do expect to spend the marketing support to do. So I think very happy, my number one thing is the 14% EPS target. We are going to deliver that heck of a hell in a high water. And if there is competitive issues out there, we will deal with them, but that’s a rougher target nobody, I know is even in double-digit range. So the 10%, I mean, we are 700 basis points above anybody else in this industry as far as EPS growth and I think that’s extremely aggressive given what we face out there. So could we – better 3 to 4, possibly but if we do, we will probably reinvest the money in the business with the marketing spending so I want to exit next year the share growth on leave three quarters of our brands ad maybe strong in the fourth quarter that formula has worked for us consistently. I told you, I will show you numbers that will stay in general our January results were very strong this year, so we are very off to a good start, you always worry; you have a good year and a good quarter. But the inventory loading is something that did not happen and I was gauged by how well January is – and January is off to a very good start. So I’m very encouraged. So we are off to another good year, its one month, but I will take it. And then in the bag, we see what happens ago 11 months ago, I think that’s a very, very positive about 2013 for my company. (inaudible)
Unidentified Analyst: And just a two questions on gross margin, last year, you said you did 30 basis points on the base business and if you are sort of sticking with your long-term 25 to 50 for 2013, you will have a full year of partial compaction. You got a full year of the price increases in (inaudible), you got a full year of Victorville, so why couldn’t we see something better than the 25 to 50 on the base business. And then secondly a little help on the cadence of the gross margin this year because you have obviously got some shifting comparisons in the base period into 12 plus you got Avid.
Matthew Farrell: As far as the comparisons go, my favorable comparisons in the second half, so when you think about 5ish on a full year, you would expect to be down in the first half and up in the second half because Avid obviously we are going to get some of those synergies, $15 million of synergies, most of those come post 2013. But, it’s some coming in the second half of this year. Can we beat the 25 to 50 basis points maybe like Jim said its just like the 3% to 4%. So there is a lot of things that could happen during the year and we do a lot of pluses as well also have we have a lot of dry powder with which to deal with competitors.
James Craigie: Yeah, you are right. We have a lot of things in the pipeline we hope come true but that’s still given where everybody else is these days, that still I think and could target but aggressive target on the core business and the mix claw down from the Avid business. So but we do a lot of good initiatives, we put a lot time last year with the new plants and everything else or even hopefully it will pay off and deliver at least that in 2013. Bill?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, following up from the gross margin, looking back the last of round of compaction, did you ever quantify or could you quantify what you did to gross margin, I mean, was it 20 basis point, 300 basis points and as we look out this, is it that type of – if it was all implemented again, can you have that type of benefit or is there something we are structurally, a lot of the low hanging fruits are being grabbed?
James Craigie: It’s about 472 time people have asked this for our historical gain (contraction). It was meaningful. It was the single largest product impact on gross margin in my tenure in this company I'll not you what is worth. Now this time (inaudible) on the entire flight. This time is just on the incremental piece. So, it certainly won’t be a big 2013 if not it would be big if the whole business was converting and we hope the retailers of this country receive that, the consumers (inaudible) thumps up and the retailers will then especially the big one out there will get thumps up for the entire industry to those point and let's take this to it. I'm encouraged by Clorox's action on bleach I hope that shows the way because the effort of anything we are the manufacturer do should be to grow a category and the same time bring benefits to consumers that they will appreciate and this effort does and I hope, what we are doing is kind of risky on our part to take the lead but again we did it only by the retailers being non-incremental everybody we'll talk to is willing to do that and add non-incremental to our business and hopefully consumers will start -- will react very strongly. We are going to put some good strong marketing support behind this and I think we are guiding some of the outstanding way of putting the product out there with great package and offering 20% more loads to encourage people to bring the product on and try it. So, we have got great distribution, great displace for comments. Watching this quarter, as we speak you will see it popping up; you will see the commercial start mid to late this quarter and hopefully the results will be great and hopefully it will encourage the entire industry to move with a separate on a complete basis of line.
Unidentified Analyst: And on the distribution gains, I think one of the goals or possibilities out of (inaudible) was to maybe expand distribution on the West Coast and West coast Retailers is that part of what you are talking about in some of the distributions gains or is this still too early?
James Craigie:  Yes of course, we had already been expanding on the (inaudible) West Coast and (inaudible) lot of money to ship out to some major accounts out there. So look our games, there is nothing significantly different than games in the West Coast and elsewhere because now we can ship it out there a lot less. So, yes, we have had major gains in West Coast accounts are doing very well out there in fact I'll have to check with Mr. Tursi but I believe we are the number one laundry brand and one of the major accounts in the West Coast right now certainly by far the more value brand out there. So, being able to shift a lot less distance so these accounts was going to is the reason we built (inaudible) plant. We are working so much the plant Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania was more from a processing basis because our previous plant was all just (inaudible) and that we made a very streamline plant that was all savings about processing and making the product. The Victorville plant was more of a case of saving logistics that. So, it would benefit us from having the -- much savings on the two heaviest products we make laundry detergent and cat litter. Next now he is going to be careful of caladium red.
Unidentified Analyst: What was the interest expense and why don't you to break it out and what are your plans for the balance sheet for next year?
Matthew Farrell: We actually do breakout interest expense when we file the 10-K you will see it. We typically do not do that in the Qs. For your interest expense for the company was $14 million probably you want to figure this out on your own, but next year it’s going to be around 26. So, it'd be $12 million incrementally year-over-year. Often it’s worth knowing with respect to other income as also our JV income. So, in 2012, I think it was $9 million, the expectation for next year is $7 million. That also a herd as well. So, those together that $14 million year-over-year. I like to brag too the money we had to borrow to buy Avid acquisition, my finance set a record on Wall Street ever for a company at our rating level, correct?
Unidentified Company Speaker: Yeah, for 10-year money, yeah, BBB rated.
Unidentified Company Speaker: This goes to show the confidence that Wall Street has and investors have in us being able to pay off our debt and  [Technical Difficulty] I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Unidentified Analyst: Plan to pay off any of it in '13 or what's the schedule?
Matthew Farrell: We certainly have the free cash flow to do that, so that would be an option.
Unidentified Analyst: First question on the international margins, I think you've seen sort of an outsized, if you will, EBIT margin expansion in the international business. Is that just a function of scale? And going forward, will the international business continue to close the gap with the domestic business or can you talk about that directionally? And then, can you clarify sort of specifically your strategy with respect to Pods, I mean, God forbid you're wrong and Pods continue to do well over Tide, is that a segment of the category you just don't want to play in or even continue to invest behind it?
James Craigie:  Yeah, thank you (inaudible), very good. I'll take the second part of the (inaudible) expect for the margins. No, Pods is a very great product out there. We support it, we want (inaudible), we were first in the marketplace with our product. Over the course of a whole year we've got a fair share of the product out there. We're happy with it. We a little cautionary in Q4 we did expect those consumer issues with the Pods out there and we kind of pulled back the marketing support. It's sort of reality as to whether or not this product was going to face any potential recalls or anything because of the consumer news. So, our share of the market in the fourth quarter dipped a little bit but we were a little cautious. In fact, we're launching a sensitive skin version of it. I did mention that today out in 2013. So, we fully support Pod is a fine product; its got a use out there. I think its particularly attractive to households; we have to go to (inaudible) or difficulty is easy to carry. I told you and I scream again from the pulpit, it is not helping to grow the (laundry) category in fact its hurting the laundry. People use less laundry detergent when they use a Pod they're going to have liquid or powder, but we fully supply the category. We're launching new products to support the category. We'll get our fair share of the category though we believe the answer going forward that's the best in this category, its doing another round of liquid compaction in this category. And we're going to wait for any retailers to tell us to do it, we're not going to wait so the manufacturers do it, we're going to take the lead. Matt, the EBITDA margin is?
Matthew Farrell: Yeah, can you restate the question on EBITDA?
Unidentified Analyst: No, you just said the operating margin for the domestic business over the last two years I mean, there has been an expansion but not as much expansion as you have seen in the international business so the gap between the domestic margins and the international margins have narrowed and I'm wondering if that is going to continue?
Matthew Farrell:  The international business because it's fragmented and it's in many different countries its SG&A is typically higher percentage of sales than it is for the domestic business. It's also true for marketing because they are smaller brands they still have to spend more money proportionately. So, marketing as a percentage of sales as well as SG&A has been higher historically for the international business. As far as the (other thing) that's been happening internationally is that we have been selling more household product into Canada and Mexico as a much lower margin so that's been putting pressure on their gross margins that's then brings them down closely to the domestic business and that will continue actually to the extent we continue to drive household in Canada and Mexico so it’s really a mixed effect is what you are seeing. If I could drill a bit too, we thought about distribution gains, that wasn't jus the U.S. we have some major distribution gains on our products going on and our current countries do so it's across the board. Again not because we actually didn't deserve it because our business has been growing so fast the distribution is always trying to catch up to it and our sales and marketing folks done of good job of convincing the retailers say, we need do more shelf space because you are getting out of stocks in our brand because it keep selling more and more.
James Craigie: Yes, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: Just two quick questions here. First on your 2013 EPS outlook was there anything in particular that convinced you to go to the higher end of your range maybe the strong January you had? And then the second question on EPS, your longer-term I guess algorithm consistently you have proven on your base business that you can grow EPS 10% to 12% and your adding Avid, which obviously a top-line growth faster than the overall business and you are getting some cost synergies, which should benefit going forward for many years I would imagine. Why can't this business grow mid -teens instead of maybe the 10% to 12% EPS over the long-term?
Matthew Farrell:  Good question. The answer to your first part is, when we first made that call on 2013, we are only I think partway through Q4. Q4 finished stronger and this year started out (business) strong so that's why we raised our target up to we raised the bottom end of the target. Second thing is, I hope you right but we kind of feel at this point and time 14% is a very aggressive call versus the industry. We have to compete with people out there and (inaudible) we want to keep investing in the marketing side as best we can. So, if there is an opportunity to beat that we'll probably redeploy that money back into marketing our businesses and driving their shares for long-term success.  So, we love to having a model where we have the ability to invest and still deliver the best EPS results in the industry but we don't today if I could easily beat that  non-performance strip up marketing or pull back in initiatives now they’re going to go to the future. But I want to come here every year and tell you at least on a 12% which is nobody else has done the record and we have and I don’t want to have a 20% a year I didn’t get a 5% a year following it I think that good steady double digit growth has been a key of Church & Dwight. Our investors can account on it. It drives our stock price and the consistency of the whole market and the company if you hedge fund and your looking for short term gains go by somebody else. If you are somebody want to buy a stock and go to bed at night and get that 19% CAGR unit TSR by Church & Dwight. Thank you for that 30 second public announcement. Way in the back, back from (inaudible) of producing a beautiful a baby.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Double thank you.
Matthew Farrell: I am not going into diaper business by the way so.
Unidentified Analyst:  So and by she loves Church & Dwight rattle.
Matthew Farrell: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, it’s good.
Matthew Farrell: Few money when you rattle with, got a dollar sign, I told you that.
Unidentified Analyst: So first in just in terms of the distribution gain so if the laundry compaction is incremental product how much of the distribution or is a lot of that incremental distribution in laundry business because of that product…
Matthew Farrell: No I would say its about 50-50 on our base products we have just around distribution gains too on our base products so its going to be a fantastic year for the laundry category distribution gains because we need the more distribution our core products which have been growing steadily and had another record year and now we’re launching this incrementally. So both sides of the business are doing very strong.
Unidentified Analyst: And any sense of where the incremental self space is coming from?
Matthew Farrell: Somebody else.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Matthew Farrell: Somebody who is not growing their shares.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then in terms of wide space entries. I mean last year you talked about wide space entries and some of them kind of were later in the year but how much did you say those ended up adding to your sales growth this year?
Matthew Farrell: It’s a good question. But I honestly I don’t know the quantitative answer to that is certainly is going to help us we had good results last year. I mean sometimes you have a wide space is tough and there is incumbents there they don’t want to see you there. Everything we did last year got off to a great start we’re barely upon it this year. I mean we’re taking on major players like KY like a 60, 70 share lubricants out there. And so there is going to be incumbents who are not going to roll over but we’re being very careful on this we’re not betting the bank of the company on these things we’re launching these categories with products we've been working on for several years with good strong marketing support and we’ll take a one step at a time. And I expect everyone of cases we’re here we’re going to build our share from last year and go forward form there. So we’re not I think, you should comfortable we’re not taking all our marketing money and throwing up behind these initiatives which are riskier because we’re going up against incumbents out there my sales force has got an outstanding job I can tell the lubricant line is getting out there and distribution support out there. I told you I gave the team (inaudible) his team here with new products that charge, I want to be X brand on this category bring excitement news and young feeling to all, very aspirational two versus the big guy out there who we kind of feel is out and dated and not really aggressively pushing the categories, so we are trying to bring that x type feel which is the massive success in the deodorant side of the world. So, I want to think its just – it will be meaningful, it will be meaningful and these products all carry very good gross margin to them. But we are not going to -- trust me – some of them don’t do as well which I don’t expect but we still make our numbers. We still feel confident when we make our numbers on these, we will start to build a very strong presence here. And like I said our goals to be the leading premium lubricant, I should tell you that too, the lubricant category there is a lot of lower priced products. These products are selling for obviously about $14, $15 a box. Yeah, this is the upper end of the premium market. We are not coming into low price entry, which are good chunk of the market. We don’t want to get down the low price, we are going into the upper end of the market. So like x in the category, in the upper price range of the category and that we believe the TROJAN name of the products deserve. So its very good gross margin which enables to have the marketing spending to support these products. And the winner to is, in fact, we are using existing trademark name. So I think, I told you the story earlier, we want launched Alexa– I don’t know 6, 7 years ago was my brainstorm, we lost a whole new condom line TROJAN Alexa, that was mostly Alexa side but TROJAN was there. We spend a fair amount of money on it. The line itself did not do well. We actually have to pull it out of the market but because we have spent money at TROJAN Alexa, it help to build only the best tier ever on the base condom business. So that’s how smart, we didn’t come in within brand x name on lubricants TROJANs. So all that money, we are increasing pretty significantly amount of money we are spending on TROJAN this year and that will help the entire franchise, TROJAN Vibrators, TROJAN Condoms and TROJAN Lubricants. If I have to build a mega brand and Bruce Fleming my head of marketing gang are outstanding out into the advertising, so you do get a sense of the TROJAN brand as you go out there and so everyday we spend will help you entire the line not just the new form in there, both in HAMMER, HAMMER success story I used to tell you all the details here but. ARM & HAMMER when I came here, this was on 2004 was totally what you call desperate brand, the packaging was different, the advertising was different, we spend a dollar of detergent, the new health toothpaste, and Bruce is doing brilliant job, pulled together the advertising, the packaging and everything and that’s why ARM & HAMMER which is a 160 years old, double digit in pretty tough category. We are planning that same thinking I would tell you we are the masters of mega branding. I truly feel that I will tell Coca-Cola, great master two, we are terrific ahead of mega brand, a brand. And that enables you to smartly spend the money and not to just blow money up on a new brand and new category which – if it doesn’t work, you doesn’t wait for the money 100%. This money will not be waste, it will help grow the mega brand. But its like this is the next new thing, we do ARM & HAMMER, we continue to grow that and we are expanding that to new categories, we are taking ARM & HAMMER to Spinbrush now, we took the ARM & HAMMER in an aim to simply failing now, so we will continue to grow that business. We’ve got lot of licensing on that business.  I told you before ARM & HAMMER is in more aisles of the grocery store in your brand in America more categories in your brand in America added feel to the growth of a brand, which was going 1% when I and my team walked into the door, now its growing over 10% of the total brand. Now apply that same thinking that TROJAN when I look forward in the future I think some of their brands on our portfolio have mega branding status, which we're beginning to see with OxiClean, now into dishwashing out the soap. A very successful thing we do very well and I think is a way to good results as we go into these white space categories, I hate that term, but its like five categories should make sense. So…
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. The 20% free loads that you have on the compacted detergent, is that meant to be introductory promo spending or is that kind of a baseline price point where you think the compacted detergent will be?
James Craigie: That’s baseline. And it's not a bonus pack. It will be ongoing, correct? Correct. Yes they are nodding their heads.
Unidentified Analyst: Right and is it – I guess compared to the last time compaction went through where I guess the effort was to maintain price points where you are letting it slip because you guys are going so well and leading it, is that kind of a rationale?
James Craigie: We are maintaining price points. This is from the line price with they call the 2X product. So it would be line price that’s compacted, in this case kind of an encroachment for people to go over to a slightly small package we are offering 20% more loads in it. So I think it was very brilliant move on our part to give people the incentive to- well, it's a little smaller, same price, oh, it offers more Washloads. Great, let’s try. Yes sir.
Unidentified Analyst: I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on share repurchases, you showed the dry powder slide and your leverage is still if you know well I think under where your longer-term targets are, so anything here for 2013 and then may beyond?
Unverified Speaker: Yeah we just to remind everybody, our most recent authorization was $300 million. We had $20 million left on the old authorization. So we had $320 going into the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter we spend $50 million and in January spend another $50 million. So we spend $100 million of the $320 that we had going into the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that we are done for the year, so that remaining amount of shares are dry powder for share repurchase will be used in 2014 and 2015. And it’s largely the cover share creep.
James Craigie: Yes sir.
Unidentified Analyst: I think when we got together last year you had mentioned that you had spent probably more time looking at acquisitions, than you had in – before - and I was just wondering if you could sort of give us an update on your thoughts of sort of what's out there now, and maybe what your views on bid-ask spread of buyers and sellers at this point?
James Craigie: Yeah so we are still aggressively on the trail. I’m walking out of this meeting right now and half and hour to a meeting in a side room here to look at an acquisition. We've made business, we bought Vitafusion and other acquisitions we’re very selective. I think its an interesting time out there about that I told you I’ve been very surprisingly down sided that they’re have been more acquisitions out there in the marketplace because cash is dirt cheap. Businesses are struggling organically out there. I am surprised that there wasn’t more spin off and divisions or mergers of companies but I think I told you, I think that this would happened is stock market treated everybody pretty well despite lower forecast of organic growth in earnings so companies didn’t feel the pressure, so we have to acquire something and bring a company in, driving synergies driving EPS back up. But I think with cash flow relatively cheap above debt I think you might see some more I don’t know there is a lot of actually out there honestly the sellers still have pretty lofty multiples in their heads for their businesses which is leading to a lot of sales don’t happen because they want a lot more than anybody who is willing to buy. I think that’s pretty smart on the buyers, buyers are staying pretty smart is not overpaying there have been some deals we've seen which we shook our heads at we stopped and we brought the (budgeting) business the competitor of ours bought another business in that space that twice in multiple we bought the business that we would thank them very much because we compete with them. So I hope they’re totally overwhelmed by what the price they bought but I don’t know they’ve been a great company over time we’ll see, we’ll see. There is a lot of activity there is a lot of activity people offering (inaudible) still the road block to more activities the sellers really want too much money for their businesses than that so but we’re very active because we got math so we got a ton of dry powder but we’re very selective and we love this last acquisition there is tremendous potential for us going forward in a tremendous category and we’re looking for businesses like that as we go forward. And we’ll just keep looking So then we’ll go running to one of the side rooms here to see who is there but we’re looking we constantly look and a lot of time in the road looking at stuff because it is a part of that we’re great at it and my team I can’t complement enough -- I sometimes tell people they have to work for greatest strength at Church & Dwight I think there is a lot but at sometimes seems our ability integrated business is one of our greatest strength and all my functions do a brilliant job of bringing those businesses in fast creating accretion. I mean you know a lot of acquisitions on accretive year one, Avid is going to be we told you going to add 5% to our earnings I don’t think the company is going to do that on a scale like that and we do it and seriously absorb that we are looking right now more acquisition is coming on stream and (they haven’t) we’ll take them you might, we’ll say I cant put our trajectory you never know until they happen I know exactly what I’d like to buy right now I can guarantee we’ll get to our satisfactory price with the people trying to sell those business and if we cant no deal and if we can great. Are there question from wonderful crowd here? Well, anyways I want to thank you very much for…
Unidentified Company Speaker: Hey, we have – I’m sorry confused. I’m sorry.
Unidentified Analyst: On the latest round of compaction, how much water is coming out of the bottle and what’s the change in the size of the bottle?
James Craigie: I need my technical genius back in the corner there. This is (inaudible) can you give that in a round number so that I will…
Unidentified Company Speaker: (Inaudible)
James Craigie: All of you, I want to thank you for all coming today for the New York Exchange, two things, we had the most fantastic goody bag you have ever seen in the back of the room, with a lot of new product we talked about today. Please don’t wait to see what’s in it, until you get home in your kitchen with your children around you may want to check that do that before you do that. But with all that exciting products we have the wonder action tooth brush in there, we have the new lubricant line in there, you may want to take that out. We have new gummies in there for adults, please try out, if you haven’t tried adult gummies. I think we have two in there. All the cool store product is in there. So all of our hot, hot new items in that goody bag. And if you really boarded at 3:59 and 45 seconds, you will see my ugly face and my team on CNBC today ringing the closing bell. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you on this call the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things, the company’s financial objective and forecast. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Thank you, Vanessa, and good morning everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you particularly when we have excellent results to report. It's also a pleasure we’re talking from our corporate headquarters from Princeton, New Jersey which was shut down all last week due to lack of power caused by Hurricane Sandy. That inconvenience was minor compared to devastation occurred by many of our fellow residents of New Jersey. As a corporate citizens of great state, we deeply feel for them and we’ll be donating $1 million to New Jersey chapter of the American Red Cross to help provide food, clothing and shelter to those in need. Now, I'll start off this call providing you with my overview of our latest quarterly business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I’ll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I’ll return to provide some more detailed information on performance of our key brands and discuss our updated earnings guidance for the year, we’ll then open the call with questions from you. Let me start off by saying I'm very proud of my team for delivering the excellent third quarter business results in such a difficult economic environment. If you almost saw, Fix the Six winning ticket in your account since the company delivered very positive results on the six most important business measures. First, the organic revenue growth of 4.6% was very strong, particularly on top of the 4.5% organic growth achieved in Q3 of 2011. This organic growth is driven by both our domestic, international business units which respectively delivered 4.8% and 6.7% organic growth. Second, we delivered on our promise of gross margin improvement with a 100 basis point gain in Q3 versus year ago. Third, despite lower marketing spending as a percent of net revenue, we grew share on our four biggest brands, representing over two-thirds of our total revenues and profits. This includes all time high quarterly shares on ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, XTRA liquid laundry detergent and TROJAN condoms. Fourth, we continue to tighten our belts in view of the difficult economic environment and lowered our overhead cost by 70 basis points. Fifth, the strong organic revenue growth, higher gross margin and lower overhead cost drove an operating margin of 20% which was 200 basis points above year ago. Our ability to deliver an operating margin in the third quarter which is higher than majority of our key competitors reflects the strength of our brands, the strong consumer demand for our innovative new products and the lean cost structure of our company. Six, our Q3 EPS result of $0.66 was 22% above year ago, far better than any of our key competitors. The 22% EPS increase was ahead of our expectations for the quarter. So at the end of this call, I’ll discuss the implication for this year’s earnings guidance. I hope with this brief overview of my company’s third quarter business results, hope you should understand my jubilation for referring to it as a Fix the Six winning lottery ticket. Now, those of you who would know me know that I’ve been a long term pessimist about the business environment. I believe we will continue to face strong headwind for the rest of 2012 and the next few years, including ongoing uncertainties surrounding commodity cost and weak consumer spending. All consumer packages, copies are funding in the same headwinds, but I believe that no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to continue to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. I’ll film my rationale to that statement a few minutes after Matt provides you with greater insight on the financial results for the third quarter.
Matthew T. Farrell: Thank you, Jim. Good morning everybody. I’ll start with EPS. Third quarter EPS was $0.66 per share compared with $0.54 in 2011, which is a 22% increase from year ago. Reported revenues were up 3.5% to $725 million. Organic sales was 4.6% which excludes the impact of 2011 brand acquisition, foreign exchange rate changes and the positive impact in 2011 of sales in anticipation of an information systems upgrade and those three items together had a negative impact of 1.1%. Of the 4.6% organic growth, approximately 5.5% is due to volume with about 0.1% positive product mix and pricing. Given our strong year-to-date organic sales growth, we expect to deliver organic sales of approximately 4.5% for the year. Let’s now review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business’ organic sales increased by 4.8% primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, OXICLEAN Laundry Additives, TROJAN products, NAIR depilatories and the introduction of ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BURST power pack laundry detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powdered laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER SPINBRUSH, ANSWER diagnostic kits and ARRID deodorant. Volume contributed approximately 5.2% to sales, partially offset by 0.4% negative impact of product mix and price for domestic. International increased organic growth by 6.7% in Q3 due to higher sales in Europe and Australia. This increase is driven by a higher volume of 6.6% and 0.1% from a negative from product mix and price. The international business had sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3. This was largely driven by the performance of NAIR in Europe and BATISTE in both the UK and Australia where we recently introduced BATISTE. For our specialty products division, organic sales were lower by 0.9% with volume down by 4.7% and price up 3.8%. The price is driven by animal nutrition where we are recovering raw material cost. We expect our value products particularly in the laundry category to continue to benefit from the weak economy and deliver strong organic growth. As communicated throughout the year, we expect this quarter to post smallest year-over-year increase in organic sales as we are camping 7.1% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. With respect to gross margin, our reported third quarter gross margin was 45.2%, which is 100 basis point expansion from year-ago. The increase in gross margin is consistent with our expectations and is primarily due to reasons we discussed during the second quarter conference call. And those were productivity improvements from our new plant in California, and in-house production of the unit dose laundry products, the launch of new products, there would be lower sliding. Fourth would be pricing such as ARM & HAMMER cat litter, and finally the benefits of our commodity hedging program. We continue to be confident in our expectation of full-year gross margin expansion excluding Avid, because these initiatives have already been implemented. We expect gross margin to be above 45% in the fourth quarter and for full year we expect gross margin expansion to be at the lower end of our 25 basis points to 50 basis point range, excluding Avid. Now marketing, marketing spend for the third quarter was $92 million or 12.7% of revenues, which is 40 basis points decline from the prior year’s spend rate and slightly higher on a dollar spend. This reflects a shift in spending from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012 as we support new product launches in Q4. We grew dollar share on five of our eight power brands and this is due to a great execution of our sales and marketing teams. SG&A was lower year-over-year by $1.9 million. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 12.4%, down 70 basis points from year ago. The lower SG&A cost in the quarter primarily reflect lower legal costs and a timing shift from Q3 to Q4 related to R&D development expenses. For the full year, we expect SG&A to be approximately 13.2% of sales which is down 20 basis points from year ago; this is due to reflection of our continuous vigilance to control SG&A. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 20% and that margin is 200 basis points higher than last year’s 18%. Income from affiliates decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower income from our Armand Products joint venture as well as start-up cost related to our Natronx joint venture. Other expense was favorable year-over-year do primarily due to an FX loss in 2011 that did not repeat in 2012. And income taxes, our effective rate for the quarter was 35.7% compared to last year’s 36.9%. The 35.7% for the quarter was expected and with respect to our full year, the full year effective tax rate should be approximately 35%. Cash flow; we generated $315.9 million of net cash from operations for the first nine months of 2012 which is a $3.3 million decrease from the prior year. Remember that’s net of an $8.9 million increase in year-to-date CapEx. We spent approximately $50 million in year-to-date CapEx, large percentage of that it’s actually $24 million of that was for our new California manufacturing and distribution facility. Next I'm going to discuss the share buyback, which we announced in the release. So we’re pleased to announce the Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program, under which the company may purchase up to an additional $300 million of the Company's common stock. Under the program shares will be repurchased in the open market at time and amounts considered appropriate by the Company based on factors including prices and market conditions. The company has approximately 140,000,000 shares out standing, we have an additional $20 million remaining on our existing repurchase program, the primary purpose of the program is to cover share creep and we expect to limit our purchases to approximately $100 million between now and end of 2013. And we may purchase some shares beginning in the fourth quarter. And I'm going to turn my remarks to Avid. On October 1, the company closed on its acquisition of Avid, the purchase price was approximately $650 million financed primarily with $400 million of senior notes at a coupon rate of 2.875 due in 2022 and commercial paper. Jim will discuss Q4 and 2013 outlook in a moment, but I want to take this opportunity to provide cloudy and some of the one-time charges in the fourth quarter that we're taking into account within our guidance. So we expect our transaction costs of approximately $4.5 million, we expect to inventory and fixed asset step up of approximately $7 million, which will be in 2012, and we expect to have $2.5 million of incremental amortization in the fourth quarter. There will also be transition expenses of approximately $1 million in Q4 related to severance and information technology system design. With respect to 2013, we do not expect to have a material amount of transition cost next year. I would estimate it to be $0.01 or less and will not be calling them out separately. So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include 4.6% organic sales growth driven by 4.5% volume growth and we had a 22% increase in EPS. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.55 compared to $0.53 last year excluding the deferred tax valuation allowance charge of $0.09 per share. The company reported $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2011. So we are expecting a good fourth quarter. We are raising our annual earnings per share goal to $2.43 for the year which is an increase of 15% over last year’s reported $2.12 and 10% higher excluding the fourth quarter 2011 deferred tax charge of $0.09 per share. Back to you, Jim.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I’ll finish off our call today by providing a little color to the outstanding third quarter business results that Matt just took you through and my outlook for the rest of the year. Our strong third quarter business results are directly linked for the seven factors that support my earlier statement that I believe that no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough business environment. First, we have the most unique product portfolio in the CPG industry that consist about premium and value brands which puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy as exemplified by our consistently strong double digit EPS growth over the past 11 years. In particular, our value brands representing about 40% of our revenue base have experienced strong growth in this recessionary economy as consumers are making smart choices by switching to and staying with our high quality, the lower price brands. A great example of this is the fact that our value based ARM & HAMMER laundry and Trojan business which is our largest business achieved almost 10% dollar sales growth in the third quarter and reached an all-time high quarterly share. This record of high quarterly share enabled ARM & HAMMER to pass the all brand to become a number three brand in the liquid laundry detergent category. In addition, the strong share gains achieved by ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER power laundry detergent and extra our extreme value liquid laundry detergent, enable Church & Dwight to pass the Sun Products company to become the number two laundry detergent company in America. This is the remarkable achievement for my company which has been driven by a combination of new products, increased distribution, higher marketing spending, and increased merchandising support behind our value oriented brands. The second factor which is a key driver of Church & Dwight success is we have a proven record of building our Power Brands. We have over 80 brands in total, but eight of these brands are our Power Brands which generate 80% of our sales and profits. And each of the first, second, and third quarter of this year we grew market share on five of our 8 Power Brands. The key factor driving the growth of our Power Brands is our robust pipeline of new products. Over the past four years, new products delivered over 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We have shipped innovative new products at every category this year to sport delivery, organic growth target of 3% to 4%. We expect the new products to be a successful as the new products introduced over the past four years. A sample of these new products include the new sensitive skin product for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent line that has been signed to significantly enhanced the brands appeal to over 50% of our consumer households who have sensitive skin issues. We believe this will help to drive continued growth of the ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent business which has achieved 14 consecutive quarters of growth. Another great new product launch in 2012 is ARM & HAMMER ULTRA LAST cat litter. Every granular, this new cat litter is quoted with baking soda to deliver long lasting order control. ULTRA LAST is of to a great start and files the hugely successful launch of ARM & HAMMER Double Duty cat litter line in 2010. These two new products now represent over 50% of the brands total cat litter sales and help drive over a 15% increase in dollar sales growth and a 2.4% share gain in the third quarter versus year ago. As a result, the ARM & HAMMER cat litter brands have now achieved 35 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, 10 consecutive quarters of share gains. It is now the clear number two brand in the clumping cat litter business. That’s pretty impressive for a category which we entered only 14 years ago. It also shows the strong consumer appeal of the ARM & HAMMER brand which now accounts for over $1 billion in total annual sales. On the personal care side of our business, we have several exciting new products in 2012. First is our new TROJAN condom called CHARGED, which had deep ribs and special lubricants to provide intensified pleasure. This new product help to drive an all-time record quarterly share of 76.6% for our TROJAN condom brand, up a full point versus year ago. Another new personal care product is Tooth Tunes, which is a line of toothbrushs for young children, that uses proprietary technology to play two minutes of music, do your job own do you hear from a broad range of artists such as Black Eyed Peas, Queen and Selena Gomez. For those of you who have young children, I guarantee you that if they use to a Tooth Tunes toothbrush, you will have to yell your kids start brushing instead of yelling at them to brush. Tooth Tune represents our first entry in the 800 million manual toothbrush category and initial distribution, sales and share results for this new product which began shipping in July are very strong. We are also pursuing two other high margin white space category to help drive the company’s future growth. First is the vibrator category which is over $300 million in size with no major branded players. We first entered this category in 2005 with our iconic TROJAN brand and this year we are launching full-sized vibrators in the new channels. We are very pleased with the consumption gains in our entire vibrations line which were up 25% in the third quarter. We also recently initiated a free sample program in key urban markets across America, which we are giving away several thousand vibrators in this city to demonstrate the broad consumer appeal of this product. The first event was held at New York City in early August, and it created such a buzz that it was temporarily shut down by the Mercy’s office due to the traffic jams that created. Now, the second white space category that we recently entered were the OxiClean brand with a dishwashing additive category, which is over $100 dollars in size. The government mandated removal of phosphate from dishwashing detergents in 2010 creating the need for a booster product to do with the noticeable increase and cloudy film and glasses and dishes. Our new OxiClean dishwashing booster product enhances the cleaning power of dishwashing detergents, so once again delivered crystal clear dishware. This new product has already achieved a 10% share of the dishwashing additives category after only seven months in distribution. There are many other new products that we have launched in 2012, but at the interest of time I'll move out my review with the factors driving Church & Dwight continued success, and discuss our updated earnings guidance for the year. Let me quickly run through the five other key factors of our continued success. Number three, is that we have proven history of ferociously defending our brands as evidenced by our defensive OxiClean when a large competitor enters the laundry additives category. In fact, OxiClean’s third quarter share of 41.1% is 200 basis points above year-ago twice the size in the year’s competitor and a higher share that won the major competitor first enter the category. So we have not only successfully defended our position, I guess this multibillion dollar competitor, but now we are tackling back and growing our share position. The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our international business. While our international business represents only 20% of our total revenues, it is delivered high single-digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the past five years. This strong growth continue in the first quarter of 2012, but did not continue in the second quarter due to some competitive issues. We promised you in our last earnings call on August, the programs that are put in place are reinvigorate or get a growth in our international business, and we delivered on that promise. As stated earlier, our international business achieved organic growth of 6.7% in the third quarter. This was driven by strong sales gains across a wide range of markets and countries including Western Europe, Australia, Mexico and Brazil. Factor number five behind Church & Dwight success is our long history of expanding gross margins through class optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher margin new products. We expanded gross margin by 1500 to 1600 basis points in the past 10 years. While we did not improve our gross margin in 2010 and 2011, we were successful in holding 380 of the whopping 430 basis points gross margin gain achieved in 2009 despite major headwinds from higher commodity costs. A despite of 100 basis point decline in gross margin in the first quarter and second quarter of 2012, Matt and I promised you back in August that a broad range of initiatives have been implemented that would enable us to achieve our gross margin improvement in the back half of 2012, and once again we delivered on that promise with 100 basis points improvement in gross margin in the third quarter versus year-ago. We expect even a stronger improvement in gross margin versus year-ago in the current fourth quarter. Factor number six behind Church & Dwight’s long-term success is our ability to tightly manage our overhead costs. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major consumer packages company. As mentioned earlier our SG&A overhead costs were down 70 basis points in Q3 versus year-ago, and a full 60 basis points below year ago for the first three quarters of 2012. This significant reduction reflects how aggressively we manage our overhead cost to stay best in class in our industry. Finally, factor number seven is the strong record on free cash flow conversion. We will quadruple our free cash flow with the past 10 years. Over the past five years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income was 128%, which was best-in-class in the CPG industry. On a full year basis, we will again exceed 100% free cash flow conversion in 2012. Our cash flow and strong balance sheet have enabled us to smartly invest in our future through investments in our supply chain including construction of more efficient new plants and the acquisition of faster growing leading brands. All of these factors give me great confidence about our ability to deliver our aggressive 2012 business targets despite the very tough business environment facing all companies these days. In my bias opinion, no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment. We were delivering exceptional EPS growth before the recession. We are delivering exceptional EPS growth during the recession and we are taking actions to ensure that we can continue to deliver exceptional EPS growth going forward regardless of the future economic environment. Before I switch gears and talk about the outlook for the rest of 2012, I’d like to make a few comments about our recent acquisition of the Avid Health Company. For those of you who are not familiar with Avid, it is one of the fastest growing company in the vitamin, mineral and supplement category. This category is over $5 billion in size and is one of the fastest growing categories of consumer package goods with a 5% to 6% historical steady growth rate. Avid’s L'il Critters brand is the number one brand of children’s gummy vitamins. Avid’s Vitafusion brand is the fastest growing brand in the adult gummy vitamins. Overall, Avid holds a two-to-one share advantage relative to the number two gummy vitamin competitor. There is a great deal of future growth opportunities in this business. We believe the upside is two-fold. First, gummy vitamins represent about 58% of all children vitamin sales today with only about 3% of the adult vitamin category. However, the total adult vitamin category is about 19 times a size of the kids’ vitamins or about $5 billion. So we are confident there is a huge opportunity to grow the gummy form in adult vitamins which Avid first entered in 2008. That growth has already happened as we speak, as the gummy form is the fastest growing segment of both kids and adult vitamins. Second, Avid’s gummy vitamins have won awards for the best taste profile of any gummy vitamin. Unlike other vitamin companies to sell all forms of vitamins including pills and capsules, Avid sales only the gummy form. Its excellent R&D capabilities are 100% focused on making great tasting gummies, and itself manufacturing this product were just competitors are largely produced by co-packers. As result of having the best tasting gummy vitamin in the fastest growing segment of gummy business, Avid has tripled its sales over the last three years, and is one of the fastest-growing vitamin, mineral and supplement businesses. It represents a significant new growth platform for our company that should enable Church & Dwight to continue to deliver superior EPS and TSR results to our shareholders. As Matt told you, the Avid acquisition closed on October 1, and a multifunctional team from Church & Dwight is now in full control of the business and integration is underway. Now let me switch gears and simply talk about our outlook for the rest of 2012 and our initial forecast for 2013. As stated in the press release, as a result of our outstanding Q3 results, we now expect diluted earnings per share for 2012 to be $2.43. This is an increase of 15% on a reported basis, and 10% over 2011 when you exclude our deferred tax violation allowance of $0.09 per share that we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011. Please also note that the new EPS forecast for 2012 does not include any potential EPS impact as a result of Hurricane Sandy. We also previously announced that the recent acquisition of the Avid Health Company was expected to be approximately $0.02 dilutive to 2012 earnings per share. We have now improved visibility into one-time charges as Matt told you about in his result; we believe the acquisitions will be earnings neutral for 2012. So in total be improved our 2012 EPS outlook by $0.04, $0.02 we are now forecasting the high end of EPS range for our core business and $0.02 from the elimination of dilutive effect of the acquisition. In addition to the higher EPS forecast for 2012, we plan to redeploy some of the higher than expected earnings in Q3 to increase marketing spending in Q4 that will drive strong consumption, enable us to exit the year with strong momentum just as we did last year. We strongly believe that we can deliver these aggressive EPS target despite continued weak consumer demand. Our confidence delivery in this aggressive EPS target is based on two key factors. First, we strongly believe that we can continue to deliver the market share gains at our power brands to deliver organic growth of 4.5% for the full year of 2012 which is above our annual target of 3% to 4%. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, significant distribution gains across majority of our power brands and strong marketing support. All three of these factors help to drive 5.5% organic growth in the first three quarters of this year and to contribute to continue organic growth in the fourth quarter 2012. However, the organic growth in the fourth quarter will not be as strong as the first three quarters because we were up against 7% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter 2011. A second, I’ve stated earlier, we strongly believe that we can still deliver strong gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter to achieve our annual target of 25 basis points to 50 basis points despite being down about 100 basis points in the first half of 2012. Our gross margin expansion is expected to result in a wide range of initiatives that have already been implemented as Matt highlighted earlier. As a result of these factors, I feel confident that we can deliver diluted earnings per share growth of 10% for total 2012 on an adjusted EPS basis. 10% EPS improvement for total 2012 is terrific in this tough business environment and better than all of our key competitors. However, we are going to do even better in 2013 when we expect earnings per share growth of approximately 13% to 15%, driven by 9% to 10% earnings growth from our strong core business and accretion from the recent acquisition of the Avid Health business. And we expect to deliver the 13% to 15% EPS growth while also increasing the marketing investment by the newly acquired gummy vitamin business and our 8 Power Brands. Is this outlook for the Church & Dwight business doesn't excite you as much has excites us, then call me for some gummy vitamins and a free vibrator to wake you up. In conclusion 2012 shaping up to be another very challenging year due to the weak consumer demand, but when things get tough you should place your best from the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage our portfolio and new acquisitions did deliver strong EPS growth. That ends our presentation, and I will open the call to questions you may have, which Matt and I'll do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets.
James R. Craigie: Hey Jason.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: I have two just kind of housekeeping things and then just kind of more strategic question guys. Matt you were mentioning about the fourth quarter of those one-time items, is that including or excluding in the $0.55, I just wanted to be clear on that?
Matthew T. Farrell: It's all in.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: So it's all in. And what's the total EPS impact I mean, when would you calculate that to be when you look at the $0.55 is that a couple of pennies?
Matthew T. Farrell: Well if I rack those numbers up, we said the transaction class were $4.5 million, we got $1 million for transition. The incremental amortization is $2.5 million, that’s still an estimate by the way through – the appraisal done. We got step-up of 7, so your act is up and you are going to say, well, that’s $15 million. And then if you want to add some more to that, you’d see the incremental interest also of $3 million, we got to finance the transaction, that’s 18 and a penny is about $2.2 million, so you can kind of do the math from there, 8 plus cents.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That’s good to know. Okay and then I guess the second question, when you talk about the marketing shift in the third to fourth quarter, where are you looking then for the fourth quarter. So obviously last quarter you guys were talking about third quarter was going to be higher marketing than the fourth quarter and clearly I think lot of us like the set up here that you will have strong momentum heading into ’13 with the step-up marketing in the fourth quarter, but where should we end the year with marketing expense and then how should we think about that for ’13 when you look at including Avid in there, is 13% the right way to think about it as a long term target?
James R. Craigie: If you look at the trend over the last couple of years, you probably will remember we were at 12%, I guess we went from 12%, back in 2009, I think we went up to 14% then we went down in 2011 to 13.1%, yeah, that’s right. And then 2012, we think we are going to be more or like mid-12s and we have found that given the growth of our value business that the mix has changed within the company and 12.5 collar makes more sense on a go-forward basis in order to support the growth rate. As you can see in the third quarter, we had mid-12s marketing as a percentage of sales that we had 4.6% organic growth, so which is a good trend.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: So, when you talk about ‘13 and saying you're going to invest more behind the brands as well as Avid, should that trickle up, but maybe not get close to ’13, I guess I’m just trying to conceptualize what you’re saying, I understand the dollar sales will be higher, I guess just so we kind of have something in the benchmark against.
Matthew T. Farrell: Yeah, I would use just round numbers 12.5%, because you remember, you also keep in mind is Avid when we took over that company, they have 6% to 7% historical marketing spend. We're going to say, we're going to take that up to double-digit. And I don't know that will take it up as high as 12% or 13%. But I think 12.5% is a good walk-in around number for 2013 marketing spent.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: Okay.
James R. Craigie: Jason, this is Jim, always remember we start the year in the Q1 with our lowest spreading of the year because before the new products are launched and then we steadily increase it and this Q4 will be the strongest quarter of the year in marketing support in the neighborhood of above 14%.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then I guess the bigger picture question is, now you guys kind of blessed the nine to ten core for next year. Can you talk about the top line, and how that shaping up. I mean this year you guys are going to do better than 4%, 4% seems to be you always said I think historically 3% to 4%, but you comp up against some tough laundry comparisons double digit type of growth even starting in the fourth quarter, personal care, very pleased to see that sequentially that improve, so I guess can new kind of frame up how you see top line for ’13 playing out, household versus personal care as you start to think forward there?
James R. Craigie: Jason, we’re still at the process of finalizing our 2013 plans. At this point in time, I would tell you to stick within our 3% to 4% evergreen target. Right now the mix we’d have to get back to you on that. I think you are right, we're very happy with the household side, continues to have a strong growth, and personal care just below came in flat versus being down in prior quarters. So we’re very happy with the improved mix, which has been driven lot for the new products. But for right now just gauge 2013 in the 3% to 4% range.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, fair enough. I'll turn it over to the next caller.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Lackey from Wells Fargo Securities.
James R. Craigie: Hello, Joe.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo Securities: It was down for the four of the eight Power Brands, but I guess 70% of your volumes go up, but I guess maybe if you could run through the categories were market share was down, and may be describe the dynamics on what's going on there with your competitive position?
James R. Craigie: Yeah, Joe. Again ARM & HAMMER have very strong quarter, extra strong quarter, OxiClean very strong, TROJAN record share, first response was flat, so really five of our eight Power Brands doesn't all of our biggest one as were up or flat versus year ago. The story of three that were down it's actually different by rebrand. SpinBrush, if you just look within the power battery toothbrush category was down a little bit. If you look on a total toothbrush category when you add in the initial pack now was Tooth Tunes was actually up top of the share point, so we’re happy with that and Tooth Tunes are come on stronger in the fourth quarter and we have some big display support coming from that. NAIR actually had got a great year, NAIR sales were up single-digit with the category explored with over 20% category growth driven by a new product from Proctor, which did very well, so a facial depilatory. So we had a very good year on NAIR and this one time unusual event of new competitor in the category drill the category sales even higher than our sales. So well our share is down, we're very happy with NAIR this year. The only brand that’s having trouble is ORAJEL that’s an issue with private label right now. Plans are in place to improve that and the share results are already getting better on that. So quite honestly of our 8 Power Brands, only one ORAJEL is one that had true share declines that are something to worry about and we are fixing that.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thanks. And if you could just maybe talk a little about U.S. category growth rates, if we look to attract channels by our main categories like liquid laundry, we’re seeing the growth rate of the category as a whole slowing down. Maybe if you could run through your bigger ones, I mean are you kind of seeing it overall slowing here in the third quarter and how are you seeing it starting to shape up in the fourth quarter?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Joe I’m going to just tell you, it’s kind of stuck in neutral right now. Overall, we are in 12 categories. We look at, six were up, six were down in the fourth quarter, but all relatively anemic up a little bit on some, down a little bit on others and it’s been kind of that way for several quarters right now. So I would just say that the economy has stuck in first gear and I don’t think there are any signs right now of getting better. I wouldn’t say there is any signs to get the worse either, but it’s just of kind of stuck in neutral overall.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo Securities:  Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: Hi, Jim. Good morning.
James R. Craigie: Hey, Bill.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities:  Hey, is there any financial impact if you decided to kind of look at the sort of 72 brands that (inaudible) non-core, but I think you said 70% is in 8 Power Brands. So if you got rid of those financially, would there be might decent savings about the gross margin and EBIT line or is it so small to play no that material.
Matthew T. Farrell: Hi, Bill. This is Matt. Yeah, I think like any CPG company there is a fair amount of tail brands that a lot of people don’t talk about, and these are brands that you don't advertise, and they kind of bump along and many of them are kind of flattish year-to-year and have a very loyal customer base and these have a lot of overhead in their plant. So as you know, we have picked the few things off over the past couple of years. We've got rid of BRILLO, get rid of Lambert Kay, the brands we picked up on ORAJEL were six orphan brands that we booted as well. But we continue to look at tuning, but they wouldn't be wholesale (inaudible) minor brands that wouldn't make any sense.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: Got you, great. Thanks. But also a month, but if you could put something like the scan channel data would tell Wall Mart and obviously and some of other dollars 200 stuff and it likes the whole industry for the last couple of months saw sort of pretty big slowdown, is there anyway to explain that?
James R. Craigie: Please tell Obama.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: Really just anything (inaudible) had the election.
James R. Craigie: Keep going.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: All right, that was actually the bulk of my questions, thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.
James R. Craigie: Hi, Alex.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Hi, okay, so my first question is on Avid, you gave us an update on what we should be adding into our model for its sales this year, I mean in the fourth quarter and then 2013? And then what are its gross margin and EBITDA – and EBIT margins ex all these charges for modeling? Is that 45% gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter, does that include Avid?
James R. Craigie: No.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Okay.
James R. Craigie: All right. As you probably know and everybody in the call knows, as we don't call out sales and gross margin in line items for any of our brands and we haven’t done that historically nor we do that going forward. To give everybody a little bit of help on this, you may recall that we said that the trailing gross margins for this business were around 39% and we expect it to grow at 43% by 2015. Some of that will coming next but most of it – we had $15 million of synergies are going to come by mid-2014. We previously thought it would be earlier in the year, early in 2014, but we are thinking mid-2014. Those $50 million of synergies are largely cost of goods sold, some of it is SG&A so it’s probably two-thirds, one-third split but as we get into the business, we are refining that. As far as the EBITDA margin, first a very good story. Historical EBITDA margins for 2011 were 21.5%, now we expect this year to be exceed 22% for the total company. This is Church & Dwight now and the business we bought had trailing EBITDA margins of 25%, that’s unsynergized. So we have a fair amount of synergies. As we said, we have 15% of synergies which is going to take that number up significantly as a percentage of sales. To be somewhat offset and that, we did marketing spend was going to go up as well. We expect to go forward EBITDA margins, fully synergized to be in the high 20s. May as close to 20s, maybe closing to 30% which means this is a real casual generator for the company which I’ll by the way also influence are thinking with respect to free cash flow for next year, which we expect Avid to be a big transcript or. And consequently said, we might not even start our share repurchase earlier in the fourth quarter rather than May. And next just remind everybody we said, we are going to grow 13% to 15%. If you also said that 9% to 10% of our EPS growth was going to come from our core business, and the rest is going to come from Avid. So you could say two thirds of our growth next year in earnings comes from the core business, and one third comes from Avid. That helps you little bit.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Yes, and then as a follow-up, could you take a part of your gross margin expansion in the quarter, the 100 basis points and tell us the components for commodity trends, mix and promotional activity. I'm wondering if promotional activity took more on to gross margin than a year ago for instance. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell: The promotional activity I would not say was a factor year-over-year, in fact it was probably more of a help because remember we had a price increase in cat litter that helped us, and I wouldn't say that the trade rates are getting any worse either. Certainly sequentially Q2 to Q3 or even Q3 to Q4, so I think on the shelf as Jim said, we sort of neutral.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Okay, and mix how much to that help gross margin?
Matthew T. Farrell: I don't have the...
James R. Craigie: (Inaudible).
Matthew T. Farrell: I think mix would have helped actually to the quarter, because if you look at what happened with personal care, personal care was down in the first couple of quarters of the year, year-over-year whereas in the third quarter were only down 0.7%, which is quite a sequential improvement. So mix was help to us as well as the dental price increase.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: And commodity trends, what was the overall when the gross margin expansion?
Matthew T. Farrell: This some help in commodity trends, but overall, I would say that was neutral, I think a lot of the work that we do within the company to improve our unit cost, manufacturing good to get freight program, remember we brought the unit dose in-house, we get (inaudible) running now, we have less slotting, slotting would be an element of price as well. We had five or six factories all of them were contributors to the water.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: I guess the final question would be how do you feel about the unit dose packs at this point? Are they disappointing?
Matthew T. Farrell: Well I would say Alice the bottom line is there about 6% of the total category, Church & Dwight is the only manufacture with liquid business grew in Q3, the other competitors who had a unit dose farm we were the only one who held growth on our liquid business everybody else suffered declines on liquid. I’d tell you overall quite disappointing the total category of laundry detergent including liquid unit dose and power was down in the third quarter, the worse results of the year, first quarter was positive, second quarter was about neutral and third quarter total laundry detergent down about 1% that’s about 5% liquid was down, 20% powder decline and obviously unit-dose result incremental, but in total that only gave about a minus 1%, 1.3% actually hit on the quarter. So, I’d tell you unit-dose is not doing anything in fact maybe heard in the category, we’ve long maintain there’s an issue with dozing that people tend to overdose liquid or you cant over dose really unit dose, and I think as people switch from liquid to unit dose its reducing the number of doses they use for liquid. So the net effect is all I can tell you is unit dose was launched pretty much in Q2 of this year, it’s been a decline in the total laundry detergent category.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: You said negative 1.3% for the category said dollar or the volume terms?
Matthew T. Farrell: That’s dollar consumption all channel.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: And how much where you up?
Matthew T. Farrell: We were up 5.4% consumption and about 10% in sales dollars.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: What was the difference between us to be?
Matthew T. Farrell: The channels that are measured, there are some channels, some of the club stores are measured, some of the dollars stores are measured.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: And how was – what was the comfortable numbers for your biggest competitor?
Matthew T. Farrell: Biggest competitor now, go look at, go talk to Neilson or go call them.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer.
James R. Craigie: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Altobello – Oppenheimer & Co.: Your first question I guess is moving industry question, you got a couple of competitors one of which is in process of restructuring, another just announced the restructuring. Curious what your thoughts are on how that might impact activity going forward if it all?
James R. Craigie: I think there will be in total K as we’ll take advantage of it.
Joseph Altobello – Oppenheimer & Co.: Both of them or just one of them?
James R. Craigie: Both of them.
Joseph Altobello – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Interesting. Okay, and second, in terms of gross margin you guys have had a pretty robust evergreen gross margin outlook historically, can you kind of give us a sense for where you think about gross margin maybe form ’13 and beyond with that new evergreen target might be with Avid?
Matthew T. Farrell:  Joe that's a good question, it's little bit early to go and call gross margin for next year. As you know, this year presently we have 25 basis points to 50 basis points target. We think we're going to be at the low end of the range. My expectation is that we are going to have a reset here, because we’re going to have the Avid baked in obviously for the fourth quarter and then the full year. I would expect that think of it this way, 2011 gross margin was 44.2% for total company. And so, if we get 25 basis points expansion on that and ex-Avid, we are around 44.45%. Baken Avid in for the fourth quarter then when we got big step up charges and lots of things going on transition expenses things are going to hit the cost of good sold, I would expect that would depress the full year down to around 44%. So that would be the reported number my guess is on a full-year basis, but we'll see where that goes. And then that’s now we’re going to have a full-year of Avid next year, so obviously that will be a drag and you can kind of do the math, and if you got a business that’s got sub 40% gross margins and $300 million, its going to be a bit of a drag on us, but remember the EBITDA margin and the operating margin will be helped by Avid.
Joseph Altobello – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, okay that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Suntrust.
James R. Craigie: Hey Bill.
William Chappell – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Just wanted do follow-up and look at kind of [ad and promo] spend in the fourth quarter, I mean anyway to kind of quantify how much of it is offensive in terms of new products and how much is defensive in terms of what you’re seeing from competitive landscape and then maybe how much is laundry versus the rest of the business?
James R. Craigie: We can’t get into a breakdown Bill, but we spend and I'd probably say 75% of our advertising dollars on new products. So you’ll hear that we got a couple of new ones coming at fourth quarter with the new Tooth Tunes coming out there, new ORAJEL cold sore medication coming out there, we've been doing a very well that once I talked you about the ARM & HAMMER version for sensitive skin and so we love the folks at there, people love to hear new news, and helps drive the business more than focusing on the base brands. Obviously new news has great halo effect. So it will be a lot on the new products and we shift to maybe a little bit over the personal care side to help that business more, so but in general I told you be neighborhood of 14% on that revenue in the fourth quarter spend on marketing, which will be our highest quarter of the year and help us activity with great momentum.
William Chappell – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And then just kind of switch into the 2013 since commodities should be at least flat to a tail wind would you see the same thing in terms of ad and promo with the election here behind us and lower ad rates or I mean how are you looking at that and some operating leverage to the business? 
James R. Craigie: Bill, the upfront buying good games. So there is no leverage in terms of buying media that’s the networks are very successful in leveraging increases next year. So again I think (indiscernible) earlier to stick in the range of 12.5% for advertisement sort that revenue going forward. We feel very comfortable there and then we sometimes you guys criticizes for marketing the quarter. We enter the quarter looking that we have to say and then we watch closely were competitors have to say and what they do. And we adjust as we go in the quarter, we leave about 25% or more of media flexible and if we see competitive activity we pour down the defend and if we don’t see it we sometime fourth or next quarter when we expect we might see it. So we’re very flexible and how we manage to add and again the bottom line is share growth we had a four biggest brands that we share this quarter several had record shares, so we feel quite happy with the marketing expenses this quarter even though was somewhat less than year ago.
William Chappell – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And then last one on Avid maybe I missed it but you see what you found and I guess in the past two months to turn the business from slightly dilutive to mutual and are there any other one time charges that will occur in 2013 or its most of that happening in the December quarter?
James R. Craigie : Now the difference with Avid simply is that we’re in November now and before we’re in August. So we able to – little bit of conservative just within the number Bill so we left itself with little bit of room.
William Chappell – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: So was it operationally found or just lower financing?
James R. Craigie : Well financing did helpless when we got some three of the member, remember that’s only a quarter, so that wouldn’t be a big swinger. I would say just more we have not we own the business we got a better hand along on with the quarter for again its going to be.
William Chappell – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And then other charges should largely be this quarter/? 
James R. Craigie : Yeah most of them will be. I didn’t say my remarks earlier that we do expect about a penny or less of transition expenses next year and has baked into our thinking already.
William Chappell – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Bank of America.
James R. Craigie : Hey, Chris.
Christopher Ferrara – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hey, how are you?
James R. Craigie : Good.
Christopher Ferrara – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I guess for clarification real quick, so the 45% Q4 gross margin that is not a reported number that excludes Avid, but the EPS number of the $0.55 that does include Avid, is that right?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yeah, it's correct.
Christopher Ferrara – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, okay. And then I guess, if you look at the nature of those charges that you just detail right, I mean what’s one-time and what's ongoing, I guess it looks like out of those $0.06 to $0.07 of those are going to hit Q4 and be one-time, and I'm curious is that right or wrong? And then I guess as it reflects on your 2013 EPS growth rate, I mean it looks like that's given – just the elimination of those charges has given you a few percentage points of growth. So I guess is that right and that just leads you more flexibilities, how you're thinking about it?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yeah, just to recap what we said with the charges in the fourth quarter that are one-time so you had have transaction costs of $4.5 million now you have transition of $1 and then step up of $7, it was the amortization I mentioned before does keep going on. So the $4.5 million and one is $5.5, $7, $12.5 right, so it's about $0.06 of charges in the fourth quarter. But remember what we say also next year is that we are taking up the spend from 6% of marketing to in excess of 10%, 400 basis points on $300 million business another $12 million in marketing expand year-over-year, so there are a lot of moving parts Chris, but I that helps you?
Christopher Ferrara – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Yeah, that does. Thanks. And I guess last quarter, and again I think the advertizing I think again right, but I just want to get a perspective on, I guess last quarter you said that the back half of this year would be about 14% of sales, now obviously Q3 came in short of that, Q4 is going to be 14%, but what drives the change and why overall will the back half have less in advertising. Is it this mixed shift that you are talking about, and I guess how do you feel about your share boys in light of that?
James R. Craigie: Chris, we feel very best, you made a great point that we feel very good about our share boys. That how we judge things so along, as I told you, we just we shifted somebody from Q3 to Q4 the year is going to come out around 12.5%. So we feel very good, we are in our comfort zone, our share boys is very strong in the categories, we’re growing our share on all of our big business, so that’s how we judge it, and we just stay flexible audit, and we are not using it to make earnings, we’re just doing what’s right competitively, and keeping drive [part] on our banks, I guess the competitors explode with anything in a quarter where we got money that we didn’t use in prior quarter. So it’s just a judgment thing we do I think very well, and if the shares were going down you could beat us up, but our shares are growing hitting record shares, so I think we’re doing great.
Christopher Ferrara – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: So you are saying nothing change in your business that would have caused you back half advertising guidance to move lower?
James R. Craigie: No.
Christopher Ferrara – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks guys.
James R. Craigie: All right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst from Wellington Shields.
Matthew T. Farrell: Good morning.
James R. Craigie: Hey, Leigh.
Leigh Ferst – Wellington Shields & Co Llc: Good morning. Thank you for the comments on Sandy and for keeping some schedule with your earnings release, it seems a bit unfashionable, but you did mentioned that your outlook excludes any impact. Can you tell us about how you are thinking about the potential impact other than negative?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yeah, Leigh, we are not able to determine any impact at this time that we’ll have in the sales, but we said in the team, they got – the dot does not include EPS impact. While three of our plants were within the pass of the storm, we had a plant Virginia, a plant New Jersey, and a plant Pennsylvania. The great news is none of them suffered any structural damage and only one plant that one at New Jersey is out of power as we speak still, but we expect that part of restore by the middle of this week, the great news two is we haven’t up finish those inventory at that plant, and need shipments from now, but there could be some disruption coming weeks depending on the condition of actually suppliers to that plant. But again it's just been a week, we don't know at this time for storm will have any impact in Q4 business results that's for us, I would tell you too there are many retail stores, hundreds and hundreds of retail stores were shut down all of last week due to lack of power that will obviously have some impact in consumption, and it's very highly populated area of America. So that would be some what common to all CPG companies, we are little more Eastern skewed in our business, but it's just way to really just what’s going on as far as the impact in the business.
Leigh Ferst – Wellington Shields & Co Llc: Thank you. And can you tell us what kind of distribution you've gone for Tooth Tunes?
James R. Craigie: Great. We don't give a number like that. It's been very good distribution, you’ll see very good display support out of retailers, it's just really, we are very, very happy with it and initial consumption and sales have been add or above what we expected.
Leigh Ferst – Wellington Shields & Co Llc: And you're still expecting that to be a big item for holiday sales?
James R. Craigie: I think it will be a huge item for holiday sales.
Leigh Ferst – Wellington Shields & Co Llc: Okay, thank you.
James R. Craigie: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of with Nik Modi from UBS.
James R. Craigie: Hello Nick.
Matthew T. Farrell: You got power in your house in Princeton, Nick.
Nik Modi – UBS: I’m good, I'm good. We only (inaudible) for a day, but we're back and running.
Matthew T. Farrell: We’re going to (inaudible) to stay and we okay and fine.
Nik Modi – UBS: The good thing is I’m fallen up, I can actually live there. So that's good. The question I have is on Avid, you talk about the adult opportunity and I was wondered if you could just give some more perspective on that now that you’ve been kind of running the business for few months the opportunity how can you address that opportunity in more meaningful fashion, I mean is there a trial sampling type of initiative, we can do in kind of – if there is what type of conversion do you typically see in those types of initiatives?
James R. Craigie: We’ll take the first opportunity is a lot of distribution opportunities out there in the adult side, which we plan to both increase the amount of distribution in current accounts and open up new accounts out there. So that will be the first big wave coming through, we told we're going to increase marketing support, a big part of marketing is sampling, the people who we bought this business from (inaudible) quite conclusively that in store sampling is very powerful vehicle, we'll be doing a lot of that out there, because when you take this product I guarantee you with awesome, I seriously get every morning and so treat actually put these gummy vitamins in my mouth and eat them as like candy and sort of swallow hard pill in there, and I think is people actually experienced that especially adults I think that will be switching in droves over to the gummy vitamins which has same efficacy as hard pills. So distribution increased sampling, increased marketing support, and we have some new products coming out over the course of next 24 months which I think it will be very appealing in the consumers.
Nik Modi – UBS: Great, that's it from me.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
James R. Craigie:  You already have your turn Bill.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: Well you didn’t hear my first comment. I said it quantified lot of my returns this morning, but look. At the gross margin mix going forward, I mean the 5000 basis points is amazing, but lot of that sort of personal care driven so you broaden a lot of these personal care brands with sort of that gross margin up, so when you kind of look at it going forward, I think Avid was a little bit gross margin dilutive, but to me this is a temporary thing, because we haven't really, but kind of how do you get the sort of gross margin moving not necessarily to the next quarter or two, but maybe for the next three to five years.
Matthew T. Farrell: Bill the path was driven by the combination, yes there was acquisitions of higher margin brands, but yes there was also a lot of growth of the – the gross margin, the core business remember, we had compaction in the laundry a few years ago that’s awesome, we built a big new super plant Pennsylvania, we have a – this cost saving program in houses is fantastic. So but now in perspective though keep in mind we’re up around 44%, 45%. The big guys in our category are up only in a high 40s and they have all premium high price brands out there so that’s why we know or we can do 100 basis points a year as we coming close, but it is the sealing out with some of the guys. But we feel very comfortable, we can get this business up to about 50% gross margin that the Avid thing will set us back slightly, but little bit of a drag, but you got future things, I would hope some time in the next year or two we’ll see another round of compaction on laundry, which I will not quantify, but was hugely impactful to us in the past it’s our biggest business and makes a lot of sense that to go do it. But we need the whole industry to do it, so I think we will get a 50% overtime through internal programs, and we got more restructure in doing some more plans will help out to.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities:  I got, and may be [understand the] answer deeply in the press release, but I know you look as you said that sales in Europe and Australia were strong and everyone else said disaster quarter in both those regions. So are you getting distribution there, I mean is there sort of like nation value category emerging that you guys are starting to participate in or was that just better growth of the base business?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yeah Bill, its Matt, just two things, it’s – NAIR is doing well, and BATISTE another brand we bought, BATISTE is doing very well both in the U.K. and in Australia.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: Got it, but there is not an opportunity to kind of ended that value share almost its struggling a little bit, I think it probably do pretty well.
Matthew T. Farrell:  Are you referring to BATISTE?
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: No, no, no I'm sort of household products side.
James R. Craigie: Remember, outside the U.S. we are largely a personal care.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, that's what I asked you, you haven't launched household products internationally or materially?
James R. Craigie: Canada we have.
Bill Schmitz – Deutsche Bank Securities: Got you. Thanks, let me jump back on guys.
James R. Craigie: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan.
John Faucher – JPMorgan: Guys, actually I’m fine, (inaudible) asking my question. So I'll just say that's it.
James R. Craigie: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Joe Lackey from Wells Fargo Securities.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo Securities: I guess kind of thinking about this since the Avid call, and speaking a long-term I guess looking at long-term EPS growth previously your [evergreen] target was always 10% to 12% to low double digits, and I guess it remains 10% to 12%, but I guess I know you'll get the one-time benefit of Avid and you’re projecting 13% to 15% next year, but you get the ongoing synergies going forward, and obviously that acquisition is accretive, why can’t the business grow 12% to 13%, 13% to 15% when you include Avid, I mean are you projecting a slowdown in the core business over the long-term?
Matthew T. Farrell: No, no. When we said, you may recall when put out the release in August that we were come 13% to 15% EPS growth for 2013 and we also said at the time in August that we projected total shareholder return of 10% to 12% going forward thereafter. Right, so now it's around 14%, 15%, 16%. So you're asking what number be higher, I think it's little bit earlier that to be taken that number up, I mean our algorithm is delivering a 10% to 12% TSR in 2014 and beyond is intact right now, so as far as taking it, we're going to talk about that again in the first week of February when we call 2013.
John Faucher – JPMorgan: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
James R. Craigie: Okay, I thank you all for tuning in this morning after very trying week last week. I just want to say we had a fantastic Q3, we're very thrilled with the results, and we told you all about the outlook for the rest of the year, 2013 is preliminary at this point, but we feel very strong about that. So I want to thank you all for taking the time to tune in hopefully you love our results. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you, on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecast. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start off the call today by providing you with my perspective on our latest quarterly business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands. I'll then finish with our updated earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start out by saying that I'm very happy with the second quarter business results. In our last earnings call in May, we told you that we exited 2011 with strong momentum towards achieving our annual organic revenue growth target of 3% to 4%. We expected the organic revenue growth for the first half of 2012 to be higher than the second half due to the higher organic revenue growth levels in the back half of 2011. That is exactly what has happened, as we have delivered 8.4% organic revenue growth in the first quarter of 2012, followed by 3.7% growth in the second quarter, for a net of 6% organic revenue growth in the first half of 2012. That puts us in great shape to deliver our annual organic revenue growth target of 3% to 4%. We also told you in May that we expected a lower gross margin in the first half of 2012, followed by higher gross margin in the second half, to deliver our annual gross margin target improvement of 25 to 50 basis points. Despite our gross margin being 110 basis points lower a year ago in the first quarter, and 100 basis points lower a year ago in the second quarter, we are right on track to achieve our annual target, although it will be at the lower end of the range forecasted in our May earnings call. Matt will tell you in a minute the initiatives that we have already implemented, which will drive higher gross margins in the second half of this year. The second quarter results also reflect that we continue to tighten our belts on overhead costs, as SG&A as a percent of sales improved by 80 basis points versus year ago. As forecasted in May, we achieved our marketing -- we increased our marketing spend in the second quarter by 200 basis points versus the first quarter to support the launch of new products in our 8 power brands. This increased marketing spending is paying off, as we achieved market share gains in the majority of our power brands in the second quarter. Most importantly, we delivered a 6% increase in EPS versus year ago, excluding a $0.04 onetime tax benefit in the year-ago numbers. This EPS result is ahead of our expectations for the quarter and puts us in line to deliver our annual adjusted EPS target of 9% to 10%. Those of you who know me know that I've been a long-term pessimist about the business environment. I believe we'll continue to face strong headwinds in 2012, including higher commodity costs and weak consumer spending. All consumer packaged goods companies are fighting the same headwinds. But we believe that no other consumer packaged goods company is as well suited us Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. I'll explain my rationale for that statement in a few minutes after Matt provides you with greater insight on the financial results for the second quarter. Go ahead, Matt.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter EPS was $0.56 per share compared with $0.57 in 2011. EPS was up approximately 6% from year ago compared to an adjusted $0.53 of earnings per share, which excludes the second quarter 2011 tax benefit as a result of New Jersey corporate tax reform. Reported revenues were up 3.2% to $696 million. Organic sales growth, 3.7%, which excludes the impact of a 2011 brand acquisition and foreign exchange rate changes, which together had a net negative impact of 50 basis points. Of the 3.7% organic growth, approximately 6.3% is due to volume, with 2.6% negative product mix and pricing. Given our strong first half of 6% organic sales growth, we continue to expect to deliver organic sales at the high end of our 3% to 4% annual target for the year. Now, let's read this segments. I want to start with the domestic business. Consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 5%, primarily due to the higher sales of ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, period. Other products that contributed to volume growth were XTRA Liquid Laundry Detergent, ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter, Kaboom cleaners and the introduction of ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BURST unit dose laundry detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER Spinbrush, Answer diagnostic kits and ORAJEL oral analgesic products. Volume contributed approximately 8.6% to sales, partially offset by the 3.6% negative effect of product mix and price, but mostly this was product mix. I'll now turn to international. Our international organic sales decreased by 2.7% in Q2, due to lower sales in Europe. This decrease is driven by a volume decline of 2.4% and -- with 30 basis points from product mix and price. The decline is concentrated in the U.K. and France. It is largely in our toothpaste and depilatory businesses and caused by competitor actions. We don't expect a repeat in Q3, and the international business is off to good start in July. With respect to our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were higher by 6.3% with volume up 5.6% and price up 70 basis points. The price is driven by animal nutrition, where we are recovering raw material costs, and the organic increase is primarily due to stronger end markets. Now back to the total company. Looking ahead for the balance of the year, to remind everybody, we still expect to be at the high end of our 3% to 4% organic growth target. Organic sales growth was higher in the first half of 2012 as a result of easier comps in the first half. The comparisons are far more difficult in the second half due to 5% and 7% growth rates in the third and fourth quarter of 2011, respectively. We continue to expect our value products, particularly in the laundry category, to continue to benefit from the weak economy and deliver strong organic growth. Next up is gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 43.5%, a 100 basis points contraction from year ago. The decrease in gross margin is consistent with our expectations and is primarily due to unfavorable product mix, as well as sales of lower-margin consumer domestic household products, which rose 10.5%, and net sales of higher-margin consumer domestic personal care products, which were 5.1% lower. The contributors to Q2 contraction include the startup of the new California plant, which is now fully operational, and in-house production of unit dose laundry. Because of the trend in product mix, we continue to expect full year gross margin expansion to be at the lower end of our 25- to 50-basis-point range for 2012. Despite gross margin contraction in the first half, we expect to hit the lower end of the annual 25- to 50-basis-point target as a result of the following: Number one, productivity improvements from our new plant in California and in-house production of the unit dose laundry products; number two would be the launch of new products in the second half; number three would be lower slotting in the second half versus the first; number four would be recent pricing, which went into effect last week, on ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter; and finally, the benefits of our commodity hedging program. So we are confident in our expectation of second half gross margin expansion because these initiatives have already been implemented. Now, marketing. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $88 million or 12.7% of revenues. This is a 30-basis-point decline from the prior year spend, but slightly higher on dollar spend. We grew dollar share on 5 of our 8 power brands in the second quarter. This to due to great execution by our sales and marketing teams. Looking ahead, we expect to increase spending for the balance of the year. SG&A is next. SG&A was lower year-over-year by $2.5 million. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.2%, which is down 80 basis points from the year ago, and the lower SG&A costs in the quarter primarily reflect lower legal costs. For the full year, we expect to maintain approximately 13.1% of sales for SG&A, which is down 30 basis points from year ago. This is a reflection of our continuous vigilance to control SG&A. With respect to operating margin, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 17.6%. Our operating margin was 10 basis points higher than last year's 17.5%. Income from affiliates decreased slightly due to lower income from our Armand Products joint venture. On a full year basis, we expect a decrease of $3 million on JV income, in part due to the start up of our Natronx joint venture. Other income was virtually unchanged in the quarter. We do not anticipate any material changes for the full year as compared to 2011. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 35.6%, compared to last year's 30.6%, which included a onetime benefit, which I spoke about earlier. We continue to expect the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. Now turning to cash. We generated $189 million of net cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2012, which is a $17 million increase over last year. And I think it's important to remember that this is net of a $16 million increase in year-to-date CapEx. We have spent $40 million in year-to-date CapEx, of which $21 million related to our new California manufacturing and distribution facility. I'm going to wrap up now. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic sales growth, driven by 6.3% volume growth and we increased share in 5 of our 8 power brands, resulting in 6% adjusted EPS growth. We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.58 per share, compared to $0.54 for the prior year. We anticipate a high-quality second half, with gross margin expansion and higher marketing spend in each of the next 2 quarters. Now remember that we averaged less than 12% marketing spend in the first half of 2012, and we expect to average about 14% in the second half. Now this all results in a balanced year when comparing first half and second half earnings per share. So we are maintaining our annual earnings per share goal of $2.41 to $2.43 for the year, which is an increase of 14% to 15% over last year's reported $2.12, and a 9% to 10% earnings increase, excluding the fourth quarter 2011 deferred tax charge. Back to you, Jim.
James R. Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I'll finish off our call today by adding a little color to the solid second quarter business results Matt just took you through and my outlook on the rest of the year. Our second quarter business results are directly linked to the 7 factors that support my earlier statement that we believe that no other consumer packaged goods companies is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough business environment. First, we have the most unique product portfolio in the CPG industry. It consists of both premium and value brands, which puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy, as exemplified by our consistently strong double-digit EPS growth over the last 10 years. In particular, our value brands, representing about 40% of our revenue base, have experienced strong growth in this recessionary economy, as consumers are making smart choices by switching to, and staying with, our high-quality but lower-priced brands. A great example of this is the fact that our value based ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent business, which is our largest business, achieved over 15% dollar sales growth in the second quarter, which is the highest growth of any brand in the liquid detergent category. This is a remarkable result in the liquid laundry detergent category, whose consumption actually declined 2% across all channels in the second quarter on a dollar basis. Our resulting share growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent was an all-time quarterly record for the brand and far outpaced any other brand. By the way, the much heralded launch of the unit dose form has done nothing so far to help sales in the laundry detergent category, as the total combined category consumption of liquid, powder and unit dose form in dollars across all channels, was 0.3% below year ago in the second quarter. In fact, of all the major liquid laundry detergent brands that have now launched in unit dose form, ARM & HAMMER was the only brand that grew its consumption of its liquid laundry detergent form in the second quarter. And Church & Dwight was the only company that grew its consumption of laundry detergent in the second quarter. The second factor which was a key driver of Church & Dwight's success is that we have a proven record of building our power brands. We have over 80 brands, but 8 of these brands are our power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits. From 2008 to 2011, we grew market share on these 8 power brands in almost 80% of the quarters. In both the first and second quarter of this year, we grew market share on 5 of our 8 power brands. Two key factors drove these excellent share results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to increase marketing support on our 8 power brands by a total of 130 basis points from 2007 to 2011. While our marketing spending in the first and second quarters of 2012 was approximately equal in dollars spent a year ago, we expect to spend more marketing dollars in the second half of this year than a year ago to support the launch of our new products, which will achieve full retail distribution in the second half. The other factor driving the growth of our power brands is our robust pipeline of new products. Over the past 4 years, new products delivered over 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We have shipped innovative new products in every category this year to support delivery of our organic growth target of 3% to 4%. We expect these new products to be as successful as the new products we launched over the past 4 years. A sample of these new products include a new sensitive skin product for our ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent line that is designed to significantly enhance the brand's appeal to the over 50% of consumer households who have sensitive skin issues. Our sensitive skin detergent has an appealing fragrance, which has a unique advantage versus competitive sensitive skin products which have no fragrance. This new product will help to drive continued strong growth of the ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent business, which has achieved 13 consecutive quarters of growth. Another great new product launch in 2012 is ARM & HAMMER Ultra Last Cat Litter. Every granule of this new cat litter is covered with baking soda to deliver long-lasting odor control. Ultra Last is off to a great start and follows the highly successful launch of the ARM & HAMMER Double Duty Cat Litter line in 2010. These 2 new products now represent over 50% of the brand's total cat litter sales, and helped drive a 15% in dollar consumption and a 2.0% share gain in the second quarter versus year ago. As a result, the ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter brand has now achieved 34 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, 13 consecutive quarters of share gains and is now the clear #2 brand in the clumping cat litter business. That's pretty impressive for a category which we entered only 14 years ago. It also shows a strong consumer appeal to the ARM & HAMMER brand, which now delivers over $1 billion in total sales. On the personal care side of our business, we have several exciting new products in 2012. First is our new toothpaste for sensitive teeth, which combines the ARM & HAMMER and ORAJEL power brands to provide maximum pain relief in a low abrasion formula that is gentle on enamel. This new product helped to drive a share gain for the ARM & HAMMER brand in the second quarter and a higher rate of consumption growth in the leading toothpaste brand. Another new product in the oral care category is Tooth Tunes, which is a line of toothbrushes for young children that uses proprietary technology to play 2 minutes of music from a broad range of artists, such as the Black Eyed Peas, Queen and Selena Gomez. For those of you with young children, I guarantee that if use the Tooth Tunes toothbrush, you'll have to yell at your kids to stop brushing instead of yelling at them to brush. Tooth Tunes represents our first entry into the $800 million manual toothbrush category. And initial distribution results of this new product, which began shipping in July, are very strong. We are also pursuing 2 other high-margin white space categories to help drive the company's future growth. First is the vibrator category, which is over $300 million in size, with no major branded players. We first entered this category in 2005 with our iconic TROJAN brand. And this year, we are launching full-size vibrators into new channels. We are very pleased with the distribution and sales gains in our entire Vibrations line, which we believe has been aided by the popularity of the Fifty Shades of Grey novels. Second, we have entered the dish-washing additive category, which is over $100 million in size via the OXICLEAN brand. The government's mandated removal of phosphates from dishwashing detergents has created a need for a booster product to deal with the noticeable increase in cloudy film on glasses and dishes. Our new OXICLEAN dishwashing booster product boosts the cleaning power of dishwashing detergents to once again deliver crystal-clear dishware. This new product has already achieved a 9% share of the dishwashing additive category after only 4 months in distribution. There are many other new products that we are launching in 2012. But in the interest of time, I'll move on with my review of the factors driving Church & Dwight's continued success and discuss our updated earnings guidance for the year. Let me quickly run through the 5 other key drivers of our success. Number three is that we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands as evidenced by our defense of OXICLEAN, when a large competitor entered the category in 2009. In fact, OXICLEAN's second quarter share of 40.9% is 200 basis points above its share at the time when the major competitor launched its attack. So we've not only successfully defended our position against this multibillion-dollar mega brand, but now we are attacking back by improving our #1 share position in this category. The number four factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our international business. While international business represents only 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high single-digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the past 5 years. The strong growth continued in the first quarter of 2012, but did not continue in the second quarter due to some issues largely focused in Western Europe, which Matt mentioned earlier. I am fully confident that we will reinvigorate growth in our international business in the back half of the year based on the programs we have put in place to deal with these issues. Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margin through cost optimization programs, supply-chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher-margin new products. We expanded gross margins by 1,550 basis points in the past 10 years. While we did not improve our gross margins in 2010 and 2011, we were successful in holding 380 of the 430-basis-point gain achieved in 2009 despite major headwinds for higher commodity costs. This result was better than all of our major competitors who incurred larger gross margin declines during that period. As Matt and I told you earlier, our gross margin declined about 100 basis points in the first and second quarters of 2012, but that was in line with our expectations. We have a broad range of initiatives that have already been fully implemented for the back half of 2012 that should enable us to achieve our gross margin target at the low end of our 25 to 50 basis points improvement we originally forecast over 2012. Factor number six is our ability to tightly manage our overhead costs. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major consumer packaged goods company. Despite this best-in-class position, we were able to lower our SG&A overhead cost by an additional 80 basis points in Q2 versus year ago and a full 60 basis points below year ago for the entire first half of 2012. This significant reduction reflects how aggressively we continue to manage our overhead cost to stay best in class in our industry. Finally, factor number seven is the strong record in free cash flow conversion. We've almost quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion, as a percent of net income, was up 128%, which was best in class in the CPG industry. Our free cash flow for the first half of 2012 was 10% ahead of last year despite a significantly higher level of planned capital expenditures in the first half of 2012, largely related to the new plant in California. We expect capital expenditures to be lower than year ago in the back half of the year, which should lead to higher cash flow for the total year than year ago. Our cash flow and strong balance sheet enables us to smartly invest in our future through investments in our supply chain, including construction of more efficient plants, and acquiring new businesses that adds to our portfolio of power brands. All of these factors give me great confidence about our ability to deliver our aggressive 2012 business targets despite the very tough business environment facing all companies these days. In my biased opinion, no other consumer packaged goods company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment. We were delivering exceptional EPS growth before the recession. We are delivering exceptional EPS growth during the recession. And we are taking actions to ensure that we continue to deliver exceptional EPS growth going forward, regardless of the future economic environment. Let me switch gears now so that we talk about our outlook for the second half of 2012. As stated in the press release, as a result of the fact that our first half results were very strong, we remain confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate of $2.41 to $2.43, which is an increase of 9% to 10% over 2011 adjusted EPS numbers. We strongly believe that we can deliver this aggressive EPS target despite continued expected headwinds from higher commodity costs and weaker consumer demand. Our confidence in delivering this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors. First, we strongly believe that we continue to deliver the market share gains in our power brands required to deliver our target of 3% to 4% organic growth. These share gains are expected to result from increased traction in our innovative new products, significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands and increased marketing spending behind our power brands in the second half of this year. We achieved 6% organic growth in the first half of the year, and these 3 factors should contribute to continued organic growth in the second half of 2012, although this growth will not be as strong as the first half because we are up against strong organic sales in the second half of last year. Second, we strongly believe that we can still deliver gross margin expansion within our targeted 25 to 50 basis points despite being down almost 100 basis points in the first half of 2012. Our gross margin expansion is expected to result from a wide range of initiatives that have already been implemented, as Matt highlighted earlier. As a result of these factors, I feel highly confident that we can deliver diluted earnings per share growth of 9% to 10% for total 2012 on an adjusted EPS basis, which exceeds what most of our competitors are promising in this tough environment. In conclusion, 2012 is shaping up to be a very challenging year due to weak consumer demand and high commodity prices. But when things get tough, you should place your bets on the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in such an environment and a management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage their portfolio to deliver strong EPS growth. That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: My first question would be, were promotional levels up year-over-year? I mean, the negative price mix in the quarter was more than I thought, and I'm wondering if some of that was a shift from advertising to promotional spending more than you expected?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Alice, this is Jim. Not really, not really. Promotional spending was in line. Again, consumers continue to move down to the value brands, we keep benefiting from that. But really, promotional levels were fine. Pricing was a little bit below year ago, but nothing significant.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. And then to add to that, Alice, the household versus personal care mix is very skewed in the quarter.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: The promotional spending, did it take more off sales than it did a year ago?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: We don't think promotion is a factor in the story this quarter. It's really around the mix of the products.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. My next question is, you're expecting the third quarter to be a -- looks like 7% in the fourth quarter, up 13%, can you -- and that, just to get to the low end of your EPS guidance, can you explain why the shift to the fourth quarter within the second half? And also, could you comment on gross margins in the third quarter? Will they be up yet?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, we don't really look at it as a shift to the fourth quarter, Alice. As I said earlier, we have low marketing spend, less than 12% in the first half. So if we're going to be consistent with our marketing spend on a full year basis, we're going to have, average 14% marketing in the second half. So that's just math. As far as the EPS goes, we called $0.54 for the second quarter. So we beat it by $0.02, arguably because marketing was lower. So that $0.02 has to go somewhere, so it goes to the third quarter. So absent that, probably third quarter may be more like $0.60. So we're pretty relaxed about that. And as far as the fourth quarter goes, as far as year-over-year, fourth quarter year-over-year last 3 years has been up pretty high, 15% to 20% on an annual basis, so if you went back and looked at say, '09 to '10, '10 to '11 and now '11 to '12. So from our point of view, it's all in line. What is your gross margin question?
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Your gross margins, you're expecting to be up for the year. Of course, they were down in the first half. So will they start being up year-over-year in the third quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, absolutely.
James R. Craigie: Alice, this is Jim. Let me add to our marketing spending. If you look at our year-ago numbers, we spent more marketing in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. We're kind of reversing that this year. We're going to spend more marketing "spending" in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Still very high in the second half, but we're putting a very strong focus in the third quarter, because we got great distribution on new products. In some cases, faster than we got a year ago. And we're going to go out there and very strongly support that in the third quarter this year.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And is it fair -- you just said that you beat your own guidance in the second quarter maybe because marketing was lower. Was it lower than you had originally expected? And if so, why?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Look, there's lots of factors, Alice. But if we're down -- we were down a little bit on marketing year-over-year, so we came in around 12.7%. So it's all a function of timing and when we want to spend the money. So we were having a good quarter, so we pushed it back to the third quarter.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And then I have one final question. And that is you said that your high-margin personal care products were down 5.1% in the quarter. Could you tell us which products those were? And maybe that's Spinbrush, does that reverse in the third quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. It was Spinbrush, ORAJEL and Answer were the 3 that gave us trouble in the second quarter. But when you think about why is the second half going to be different for personal care than the first half? There's really 4 reasons for that. The first would be the new products. So you've heard -- you read about and you've heard Jim talk about Tooth Tunes and also the ORAJEL single dose. That's the new products. The second thing is we're building a lot of traction for our ARM & HAMMER ORAJEL sensitive toothpaste, as well as the TROJAN Charged, and also Vibes in bricks and mortar. So we're getting a lot of traction there and a good distribution. The third thing is the Q2 consumption actually outpaced our shipments. So when that happens, that actually bodes well for personal care. And last thing is really July is off to a pretty good start for personal care. So we have some confidence in the third quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I know last quarter you said that marketing would be 13% of sales this year, and I think you're still suggesting that. Is that right, you still think marketing is going to be 13% of sales in 2012?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, it will be close.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And I guess, I wanted to ask about the mix drag, right? And looking, Jim, to your point, right, I mean, this is a tough world out there, right? And people are trading down to your products, which is driving disproportionate household growth. I know the mix piece is getting -- is going to get a little better in the back half, but has your thought process evolved at all on that? And that, I mean, do you -- are you looking at mix as something that might be more of a permanent drag, not withstanding all the personal care activity? I mean, you just think it's going to be a longer drag than expected? Or do you still think it's sort of a temporary phenomenon?
James R. Craigie: I think it's temporary, Chris. We were pleasantly surprised by the numbers we got on the household side in the first half. We knew we had good growth, but it exceeded our expectations. And as Matt told you, we've adjusted for that in the back half to reflect what we think is a better mix now knowing that, between household and personal care. And as Matt just told you, there's reasons why we think personal care would be stronger in the back half, which are very solid, and we feel very comfortable about. And as he said, Q2 consumption outpaced shipments which means we entered the quarter in a good inventory position. And as expected, July is off to a very good start across the board. So we feel very good. We looked at the past results very closely. You've seen what's happened on the mix issue, and adjusted for our back half forecast between household and personal care, given all the stuff that's going on, the higher marketing spending, the new products going out there, the traction we're gaining on the new products. So we think we have a much tighter handle on the whole mix issue in the back half quarters. That's why we have great confidence around the calls we're making.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. And just one last one. I think in Q2 of last year, you called out the vibrations category at a $1 billion, then it went to $700 million in Q3, $500 million at CAGNY. I think you said $300 million today. So is there a change in behavior going on? Or are you guys just kind of taking a fresh look at the numbers on that category?
James R. Craigie: It's a fresh look, Chris. It's a hard category to estimate because a lot of it is done in nonmeasured channels. So we keep trying to get close to this channel. We could be off by a factor of 2. We've been kind of just downsizing it just to kind of get a better handle on it. It's still an enormous category with no competition basically. And we're coming out there and doing very well. We're very happy with our results. It's a slow build because a lot of it is mom-and-pop stores versus big chains initially in that. So we're building very nicely. We're happy with the results. We're just trying to be more conservative on this category call. But again, this is a category we basically face no branded competition. So it's just all gravy to us, and we're slowly gobbling it up.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just first, one clarification. I think you said, Jim or Matt, that marketing spending will be higher in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. That seems to be a bit of deviation from historical precedence.
James R. Craigie: Yes, that's true. That's true, Joe. It's just -- we're again, very happy with the distribution gains that we've made so quickly on a lot of our new products. And in light of that, we're pulling forward some marketing spending for the third quarter to take advantage of that. Normally, the new product build would probably not get the full distribution by the middle of the third quarter. This time, we pretty much got where we want by the early part of third quarter. So we want to support those new products so we're pulling forward the marketing spending, and we feel very confident that will drive some really good results in the third quarter and then fourth quarter will be strong, too. Like Matt said, our spending in the back half of the year is going to be higher than the front half and that should really drive the power brand share gains we want.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of the overall pricing and promotion environment, what's going on, I guess, in powder detergent, oral care? You're hearing, obviously, a handful of your competitors doing some pricing actions there. And also, are you guys prepared for the higher merchandising in the laundry unit dosing?
James R. Craigie: Yes. We're fully aware of what's going on out there in pricing. Our competitors have announced their actions. We have held our pricing on the powder side. We still have a very strong advantage. The only sad news about that is the powder category now has become more expensive than the liquid category, which is a change. In the past, powder was less expensive. But because of the actions in that category and the aggressiveness in the liquid side, powder detergent is really hurting. The latest quarter consumption dollars on this powder category, for the category, we're down almost 19%. That was the worst quarter in -- I can go back over a year or 2. So powder has really taken on the chop from all the activity in liquid and the new unit dose. So we'll see what happens. We've done very well. We were the only company -- we grew share in liquids, powder. And obviously, unit dose was a pure plus. So we're the only guys who grew share across all 3 categories. But the powder category has taken a real beating right now given where it is. But we feel very competitive. We're in a good position, and the people keep trading down. They love ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent. They love the new product. Our powder is doing well. Unit dose is -- we're getting our fair share of that. But I've always had my fears about unit dose, that it's going to hurt the overdosing in the liquid category. And after 4 straight quarters where the category grew, the category liquid declined in Q2. I didn't like that. But we grew share enormously, record shares, I told you. And I -- the jury is still out on unit dose, but it is not off to a good start for the category.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, and just one last one in terms of uses of cash. I think you mentioned, obviously, cash flow is very strong in the first half and looking to be strong for the full year. And I think last call you said no more share repurchases after April. Is that still the case? And a dividend payout, I guess is now about 40%. So I would imagine, going forward, your dividend increases would probably follow earnings growth. Is that fair to say?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. Two things, Joe. One is with respect to share repurchase, that is correct. We don't anticipate any additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. As far as our payout goes, yes, our payout is 40% of earnings. Our historical practice has been to increase the dividend at the same rate as our annual earnings increase. But we don't make those decisions until the February announcement or the fourth quarter announcement each year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I guess I just want to first talk about the laundry growth. Did you give a number in terms of what the shipment trends in laundry was in the quarter?
James R. Craigie: Our numbers?
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes, the actual -- within household products, up 10.5%. How much was -- what was the year-over-year increase in laundry as opposed to some of the other, cat litter, deodorizer? Was that double digit?
James R. Craigie: Yes, double digit. I'm trying to figure out what exactly the -- you asked for sales? We don't give sales by specific things. It was -- well, it was in the double digits, for sure.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I guess the follow-on question is really thinking about the back half of the year, where you do start to anniversary some tougher comps. How confident are you with some of the, as you said, some of the competitive actions that are out there, that if you look at it maybe on a 2-year stack rate, that the trends can really kind of stabilize here? And the reason why I say this is that personal care obviously has been a little bit more challenged, you do have some new innovation, but how confident are you that if the personal care sales don't deliver what you think they will, that laundry can continue to overcompensate?
James R. Craigie: Jason, I feel very confident. Household will continue to be strong. We've looked in great detail on our merchandising support in the back half, our marketing support, how our new products are doing, the distribution gains we've achieved. So even though we're comping huge growth in the back half of last year, we still feel solid about that. And the personal care stuff is really gaining traction. I think I told you, in Q2, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste grew more in consumption percentage basis than the leading toothpaste brand. The sensitive thing is off to a good start. The other new products are doing well. Tooth Tunes distribution results so far have been incredible. So we feel very well. And we exited with a low inventory position going into the back half. So the personal care is off to a really good start. So, I don't have a crystal ball of perfection but, boy, I'm feeling great about the second half of the year right now.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just with personal care, so is third quarter more about the sell-in and fourth quarter more about the sell-through?
James R. Craigie: Well, it depends. it's sell-in on the Tooth Tunes and the ORAJEL single dose cold sore product, new products. But on the stuff we launched in Q2, like the ARM & HAMMER ORAJEL toothpaste, Nair products, TROJAN Charged, those are out there. So it's kind of a mixed bag because some were launched in late Q1, early Q2. They've got full distribution now, and the other ones are just starting. But the Tooth Tunes we think will be pretty fast, because it's hot and the trade loves it. And ORAJEL single dose will be a little slower because it's just a slower category overall, and it's more towards the cold season in Q4. So -- but, just I'm really excited about the new products this year there. Obviously, over-delivering what we expected, which is great news, and I think it just makes for a good second half of the year.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: The second question, just on the international and you're -- yes, you're right, I think it was, the organic sales, it might've been negative for the first time in 6 years, I think. Europe is what, 6%, 7% of sales? I guess, can you talk about, I guess 2 things. One, can you talk about how Canada and Mexico are holding up? And two, should we expect that the whole international organic sales returns to positive trends in the third quarter? And if so, why?
James R. Craigie: Well, you can definitely expect the international to return to positive growth in the third quarter. We viewed that in great detail [ph]. We feel confident. Canada and Mexico. Mexico is very strong. We're doing terrific down in Mexico. We had a great quarter. Canada was a little short of expectations in Q2 based on some minor issues, which have been corrected. And we feel very good about our Q3 in Canada. In Europe, we put programs in place to deal with some of the competitive pricing stuff on oral care in there. So I feel we've dealt with the problems and look forward to international coming back to being a nice, solid contributor to our growth.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then the last question is a housekeeping. Matt, you were talking about the equity in earnings of affiliates. Did you say it was going to be down $3 million year-over-year? There was a $3 million number you threw. So in 2011, it was $10 million. So are we looking at $7 million, or what was that $3 million?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, that's correct.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So it's going to be $7 million for the full year. So the back half will probably be only like $1 million in equity?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: I don't have the 4 quarters laid out in front of me, but you're correct on the full year basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So can you talk about what you're hedged and when the hedges start to roll off? Because I think September was kind of when you put in the hedges in last year. So how much of the gross margin that you guys are predicting for the back half of the year is sort of contingent on some of the hedges rolling off? And is it more than just diesel?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, we have -- 70% of our most volatile inputs are hedged for the second half, Bill. And it's not just diesel. It grows everything from surfactants, resins, soda ash, latex, palm fatty acid distillate carbonates. There's 7 or 8 categories that we focus on. So we've got 70% of that hedged, so we have some sense of what our most volatile inputs are going to do. And as far as next year goes, we've been just doing some selective hedging of 2013 now, taking advantage of some of the dips that have happened over the last couple of months.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. But it sounds like it's going to be favorable in terms of lower-price hedges rolling off in the back half. Was that one of your prepared comments, when you talked about the gross margin bridge?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Remember, we came into the year, we were more than 50% hedged, almost 60%. So that was on a full year basis, so that's always been in place.
James R. Craigie: The point is, Bill, we're pretty heavily hedged in the back half of this year, so there should be no surprises on us of gross margin from any commodity actions because we're pretty well locked in the back half.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then on the SG&A side, how much of the reduction was reversal incentive compensation? Only because I don't -- you're probably not going to hit the gross margin target again. And I know that's about 1/4 of your incentive comp target.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: No, none was reversal, Bill. We -- because we're doing so well on other factors right now, we didn't reverse any of our incentive comp.
James R. Craigie: Yes, it's a composite, Bill, for 4 other metrics as you know.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just a sort of strategic question on the whole pods thing. I mean, can you maintain the price gap to the competitor when you have to put the same level of actives into the product? Does that make sense?
James R. Craigie: Bill, we're putting out a product that's comparable to our liquid product on the unit dose side. And it's doing extremely well in the marketplace. We got our fair share of the category. We're very happy with the results. I'm just, again, disappointed that it's -- the category hasn't shown any growth. In fact, slight decline from year ago, which is not good. But we're very successful. We're growing share across all 3 segments. But it's just -- I was always fearful of the impact and the lack -- on the -- it cannibalizes liquid, you lose the overdosing effect in liquid. I got no definite proof yet, but it appears to be signs of that as the overall category is down. Overall total dollars is down.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Right. But won't the mix benefit of the profit of the pods offset that? Sort of like the profit pull from the industries actually go up, right, because the raw materials associated with making a pod is a heck of a lot lower than that with like a big plastic container of laundry detergent?
James R. Craigie: That's the hope, Bill. But right now, I think everybody had start-up costs on the pod. Everybody's doing a lot of merchandising on the pod. Everybody's doing a lot of couponing on the pod. And we'll see what happens when consumers get beyond all these trial offers as to what the end result is between liquid, powder and unit dose, especially with the potential loss of overdosing, which could hurt the liquid category. So I can say the jury is still out on unit dose, but it's not off to a great start.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And just lastly, housekeeping kind of thing. But what was the price increase in cat litter? And do you guys lead that or follow it?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: We were 6%, and we followed.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.
Ian J. Gordon - S&P Equity Research: I just wanted to -- in terms of the laundry detergent again. Can you comment maybe on the trajectory of the sales and market share through the quarter? Because I think when you look at the scanner data and from some of the commentary from the big competitor there who seems to be a little bit more focused and maybe even more desperate, it sounds like things have been shifting their way later in the quarter. So could you comment on that?
James R. Craigie: Our big competitor seems to focus on one month. We focus on 3. Our 3 months results are very strong. Like I said, we had record share in ARM & HAMMER liquids. The only guys to grow our liquid consumption, our liquid share. Powder, we grew share also, despite the declining category. And we're getting our fair share of unit dose. So I'll take a long-term trend any day over a one-month trend. And knowing what we know about Q3 as far as our merchandising support and everything else, we feel very good about our laundry detergent business. You just can't beat the pricing advantages we've always had in this category. Consumers recognize, they're trading down. They're loving our products, and they keep buying more and more. And so I know the hopes from big competitors are out there, but I feel very confident we're going to continue to have very strong results in the overall detergent category.
Ian J. Gordon - S&P Equity Research: And then on the free cash flow conversion, I think, in my view that's one of the things that helps support the premium multiple. And I think a lot of that's been dependent on your ability to reduce working capital over the last couple of years. So I'm just wondering sort of what your outlook is on that going forward, and how much more can you continue to take out of the system?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, we have a focus on cash conversion cycle in the company. And for our cash conversion cycle, we focus on is trade receivables, inventory and trade payables. So if you went back a few years, we were in the mid-50s for a number of days for cash conversion cycle. And today we're under 30, and we target to be under 30. And we still have more room to go, not so much in the receivable side, but we think we can be a little more creative in inventory and also, as we get larger, to continue to extend terms on the payable side. So we do think there's some room left to go. And in the meantime, we plan on growing the company and keeping working capital flat, so we can keep throwing off increasing amounts of free cash flow.
Operator: Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.
Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Could you talk about the dynamics in the condom category as Durex seeks to gain share in the U.S.? Promotional activity, is that going up? Because it seems like your market share has been under pressure there. And I'm wondering if -- I guess I'm surprised that it wasn't one of the factors you mentioned in the decline in personal care sales.
James R. Craigie: Connie, we feel very good about the condom category. The new product Charged is doing exceptionally well out there. It's already heading towards one of the top 3 condoms in the marketplace. Our share is up in the category. And don't forget, when you're 75, I think we hit a 76, I think the latest monthly results would've been our highest ever, I think, in condom category as the Charged condom gains momentum. We feel great. So I -- our condom is good. The talk from Durex has been all talk so far. We have seen no sign in the marketplace of anything in the nature of new products or in the nature of merchandising or advertising support. I highly respect that company. And they've had terrible problems in the condom business for the past year with supplier problems. I think they've hit a record low share in the States. So I think, in some sense, they're trying to come back. But usually, when they fight, it's the other 2 guys who just battle it out and trade share. And we are, by far -- I think we spend 90% of the advertising dollars in the category, over 75 share, with the best new product. So they largely copy us, and we see nothing that gives me any concern about the condom category. And we're building now to the white space entries in the vibrators, and we have a lot more interesting things to come. So -- I'm a very big fan of my condom business, and gross margins have been growing there. We've done a lot of improvements in our factory to help gross margin in that category. So very, very happy with our condom business.
Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then just a follow-up, a kind of clarification to the question that was asked earlier about the size of the vibrations category, and it went from, in your commentary, from $1 billion down to $300 million over the course of maybe 18 months. Was that -- are all of the numbers you've given us consistently retail sales or are they manufacturer's sales or a combination of both?
James R. Craigie: Connie, they're mostly retail sales. And again, it's very hard to measure, because so much of the business is done in mom-and-pop stores out there, done online, and it's not measured -- very little of it is measured by the Nielsens or IRIs of the world. So we, over time, as we get to know these channels better, attend the trade shows and everything else to try to get a handle on it. But I'll still take -- don't forget, condoms in total is a $350 million category. So this is still a great category. We have like over 60% share within the category on the premium condom -- sorry, premium vibrator side. We have a program going on in New York City in the next 2 days. We're going to give away, I believe, over 10,000 vibrators on the streets of New York, so stay tuned. And lots of fun stuff ahead as we continue to grow this category.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just first wanted to follow up again on personal care. Because I looked back at the commentary you guys have shared in the last couple of quarters about that widening gap between household and personal care growth. And the personal care business has been getting worse, right? So it was down about 30 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 2.5 and now down 5. So I understand why you're confident it gets better because of new product activity and the inventory position. But what are the pieces that have actually been getting worse? And are you thinking that if those pieces are getting better, why?
James R. Craigie: Lauren, this is Jim. One thing we haven't talked much about, but we did a whole restructuring of our toothpaste business in ARM & HAMMER in the past year. We had changed the sizes. We lined priced it. It wasn't lined priced before. We improved the packaging. And we also came out with a new product, ARM & HAMMER and ORAJEL sensitive toothpaste. And that's all paying off now. So we very much have fixed our ARM & HAMMER toothpaste business, which is the biggest part of the whole oral care business. TROJAN, again, the new product launch has been great. Nair has had a good year. Nair is kind of -- Nair share is down because a big competitor entered with a very high-priced product in the depilatory category. We had great results for the category. We didn't grow as much as the category growth, but our consumption is up, and our shares are up, and our sales are up. So we feel good about that. The problem in the category has largely been ORAJEL, which is a very high-margin product. We've been hit a bit harder than we expected by private label on that side of the business. And we're fighting back hard to fix that problem right now. But overall, we fixed the toothpaste business. TROJAN business continues to do very well. Nair business is doing well. ORAJEL business is the problem. We're in the process of fixing that right now. And it caused a bit of a hit because it's such a high-margin product for us.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And so the -- I guess that's really helpful. On the ARM & HAMMER toothpaste, with that restructuring of the brand, was that part of the drag on sales over the last year, because there were some timing of shipments and working through excess inventory before you launched new packaging, things like that?
James R. Craigie: Definitely. It was -- again, the product line used to be at 2 or 3 different price points. We lowered the price on some, raised the price on others to be all the same price point, which is really doing much better. We changed the packaging. So there was a bunch of changes going on which impacted that key brand over the past year, but now I feel very good. That business should have very strong results going forward as shown by the Q2 results.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then on the ORAJEL new product that you guys have coming out, the single dose cold sore, is that something that, technology-wise, is very difficult for private labels to match? Is there -- is it sort of a defensible new product that helps you widen that gap again?
James R. Craigie: Yes, that [indiscernible] case has some proprietary technology that we purchased from outside of our house. And it's a terrific product that I challenge anybody who suffers from cold sores to try it. The results are far better than anything else available in the marketplace.
Matthew Thomas Farrell: It's patented, Lauren.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then also, just Specialty doesn't get a lot of attention from all of us, but pretty dramatic swing quarter-to-quarter. So just how should we be thinking about the rest of the year, pricing versus volume, or is the business going to be growing or down as it was in the first quarter?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Lauren, we expect the second half to be up for the Specialty Products business. You may recall that half the business is exposed to dairy. So, obviously, we get a lot of questions about what's the effect of the drought on dairy and the use of our products. The answer to that is because our products increase the yield of milk in dairy cows, it's actually in more demand because of the drought than if there weren't going to be a drought. So it's kind of a good news, bad news thing. So yes, to answer your question, we expect to be up in the next couple of quarters organically year-over-year.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, perfect. And then finally, on international, you told us it's U.K. and France -- it's just, I looked back, I can't find another quarter except for September, I think it was '08, when the international business volume was negative, and there, it was only like 30 or 40 basis points. So it feels like it there was a very dramatic swing there. It was really just competitive pricing activity in 2 categories and 2 countries and that was enough?
James R. Craigie: That was the majority of them, Lauren, yes. That was the key hit. And it surprised us a little bit. The oral care wars in the U.K. have been unbelievable, prompted by a big competitor's entry there, overpromising what they would do and then continuing to promote at ridiculous prices. And we've fixed that now. And then Nair is a big business in France for us. And one of our key competitors again did some very aggressive pricing, which we've now addressed.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So when you say you've addressed, are you just matching the level of promotional activity?
James R. Craigie: Yes, we are, which should improve our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.
Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: On cat litter, and I apologize if I missed part of this, but in your press release, you cited that you have strong volumes in the ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter side of the business, but a competitor mentioned that they had gained share. Jim, can you just kind of reconcile what's going on there? And then, as it relates to your unit dose laundry, how is that performing against your expectations? Again, as you already mentioned, it's coming from -- basically it's all incremental at this point. How is that going against expectations?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Tim, I don't know what exactly the competitor said, but we are kicking butt in the cat litter category, continuing to kick butt in the cat litter category. We've had 2 big winner innovative products in a row between Double Duty and this new Ultra Last. The distribution gains have been terrific. The consumption gains have been terrific. The sales gains, all double digits. I mean, just in the latest quarter, to pick up 2 share points in the category like this, which has very formidable competitors, is outstanding. So we just -- like I said, we've had 34 consecutive quarters of sales gains in this category. It's something we didn't -- we only entered in 1998 as an extension of ARM & HAMMER. So again, I don't know what the competitor said, but we are really doing outstanding in cat litter. On unit dose, a few facts on unit dose. In total, across the whole detergent category, unit dose is only about 5% of sales in total. For competitors who have a unit dose product, it's about 8% to 10% of their sales. And again, it's early in the phase. I don't want to downgrade it too much right now. But it's more promotional activity and advertise support will happen on this across the category in the second half of the year. But it's been 2 quarters since this product was launched. Usually, you'll see real strong results from the first 2 quarters. But like I said so far, it's really not making me happy to see that the total laundry category between liquid, powder and unit dose, if you add them all up in dollars, the consumption is down. So that doesn't do much to help the category, as far as my eyes, and it's hurting the liquid category. And the powder is now a more expensive product than liquid based on the pricing actions in both sides out there. So I think we're doing great. I mean we're gaining share in all segments. We're getting our fair share of unit dose. But I sure wish the category would go back to growth again, particularly in the big segment, which is liquid laundry, which after 4 quarters of good, solid growth, almost 5% in the last 2 quarters, was down 2% the latest quarter in consumption for total category dollars. That is not a happy result to me.
Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And again, you've talked about how you've got a lot of new products, especially on the consumer side, coming here in the back half of the year. You've shifted your marketing spend into the third quarter versus fourth quarter historically to sort of get out at the front of that. Given all that and given what's been alluded to a large competitor, you want to call it desperation, you want to call it hard change of course, whatever, however you want to frame it, but they're going to be more aggressive in changing their course correction here. How -- to what degree you can, how have you planned and factored that into the back half marketing spend plans, promotional plans?
James R. Craigie: Well, first of all, Tim, I would say we talk and we deliver, and they talk and they don't deliver. I would tell you, we, we're fully cognizant. We're fully aware of that competitor and respect them with the greatest degree given their size and scale. But our brands are in great shape. They've been continuing to do well. The economy plays to our hand. We've looked very intently at our merchandise support in the back half versus a year ago, and it's very strong. Really, the competitor -- we're not seeing any promotional spending changes from them so far. We're probably seeing some advertising increases, some of which are aimed at us, but are very weak in my mind. And very interesting that a larger player talks about a smaller player in their ads. That's a new change. Thank you very much for the free advertising support. So I mean we're very cognizant of it. We watch them every day, but I -- we've been beating them consistently over time, and we think we'll continue to beat them in the back half of this year.
Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, on the acquisition front again. Thankful that you guys have been very disciplined, and we continue to appreciate that. But just maybe just update the framework of how you see this, especially, again we've been at this road before. Maybe the clock ticking on potential sellers from a tax perspective by year end. But maybe just give us an update there on how you see the current environment from an opportunistic standpoint?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Tim, we continue to be very disciplined. We continue to look for good acquisitions. We work hard on it, but we're not going to make one until we see the right one out there. And I thought the environment was favorable in the past, and I continue to think it is favorable. But there's been, overall in the whole industry, a pretty low level of activity so far. But other than that, I can't comment or disclose anything related to M&A transactions until there's something definitive out there. But we continue to work hard against it, and so far, nothing to report.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I wanted to touch on -- you guys generate a ton of cash. And so I was curious given that you don't intend to repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of the year, where do you intend to -- or how do you intend to utilize that cash? And secondly, given the decline in the stock price this morning, whether you'd reconsider repurchasing shares throughout the remainder of the year?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, this is Matt. It's pretty well documented what our destinations are for cash. Number one is TSR-related acquisition. So this is an acquisitive company. We acquired 7 of our 8 power brands since the year 2000. So we're always looking for something to add to our portfolio, and we've very strict criteria around that. The number two destination is new products, investment in new products. The third would be base CapEx. The fourth is returning cash to shareholders. And fifth would be debt reduction. And debt reduction would be last right now, simply because we're only levered 0.4x debt to EBITDA. And as far as the share price today, that's today. We feel great about the second half. We anticipate a high-quality second half with gross margin expansion and high marketing spend. And we're going to be hitting our numbers for the year with 9% to 10% earnings growth.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: With regards to acquisitions, do you feel that the environment is more or less favorable in the U.S. versus abroad?
James R. Craigie: That's a one hard one, Erin. It's -- no, I really -- I think it's about the same on both sides. I know there is a lot more talk about tax law changes in the U.S., which could influence some sellers. But we're a North American-centric company. We do look everywhere, but we tend to focus a little bit more on North America. And I would say it's pretty much same outlook. I think it's somewhat positive or should be somewhat positive, but really not much has happened so far in the category or in the overall the CPG business, I mean.
Operator: The next question is from Nik Modi with UBS.
Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just 2 quick questions. On retailer inventories, Jim, I was wondering if just given what's going on in the environment, deteriorating consumer confidence, if you're noticing any change with retailers in terms of their inventory buying patterns, at least in the near term here. And the second question is, just curious on when liquid laundry compaction happened last time, what was the actual impact on consumption or dosing, if you could just kind of frame it so we can think about pods in that context?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Nik, on retail inventory, nothing major. It's nothing overall. I think retailers understandably are struggling in this difficult economy. But we're not hearing or seeing anything broadscale on inventories out there. Little things ebb and flow, but nothing substantial. That's an interesting question on liquid laundry compaction. I'd honestly, Nik, have to go back and check the notes on that to give you an accurate answer. Maybe we can follow up and give you an answer on that one, but I'd have to go back and check on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Leigh Ferst with Wellington Shields.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: My question is about Tooth Tunes. And as I recall there were some issues in getting it to launch, but it sounds like you're really excited about it. And I just want to make sure you're -- if you could just quickly review what those issues were and how they were resolved? And also my impression is it's not a huge category. But there's a lot of excitement around it. And I'm wondering if you have line extensions planned if you meet your target sell-in.
James R. Craigie: Yes, I mean the details -- last year, was a minor technical issue. And we don't like to launch products unless things are perfect, so we held back on it. And the product's in perfect -- We already are shipping it. It's great. It works beautifully. This isn't -- Tooth Tunes is a manual toothbrush. And manual toothbrushes is an $800 million category in this country. So that's huge. And we think we really got a unique product. It's proprietary technology. The last time, this was -- Hasbro initially had this product about 5 years ago. In its first year of very limited distribution, it did about $50 million in gross sales. I'm not going to predict to you what we expect on it, but the distribution results have been very strong to-date, and it's just a very unique product. If you follow any kind of consumer packaged goods business, there are some universal appeals out there. And music is something which has a universal appeal in almost any category you go out there. So we really think this will kind of revolutionize toothbrushing, especially for young kids. As far as future line extensions, definitely. If this thing does as well as we think, we can definitely target older age groups and be very selective of the music. So we already have those plans in place for next year. I don't want to reveal them at this point in time, but we have some very exciting new news in that respect coming out next year.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: I heard about some rock 'n' roll, but maybe you're not ready for that. And on the question -- I wanted to go back to the question about the mix. Is there anything unusual in how you measure your price mix versus your volume? And also, are you -- how do you look at organic growth? Do you -- are you happy to get all this volume even if you give back some of it in price and mix? How do you look at that tradeoff?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes, you're right. It's a good news, bad news thing. So our household products are typically 15%, 20% lower gross margins than personal care. So yes, when the volume is really going great on the household side and personal care is suffering, the result is obviously pressure on your gross margins, and then a giveback on top line as well. So the good news is that we have such a balanced portfolio between value and premium that we're able to sustain our long-term targets of TSR, total shareholder return.
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division: But your -- is your target on organic growth overall, and whether it comes from volume or pricing mix?
Matthew Thomas Farrell: Yes. The 3% to 4% organic growth is an all-in number. That's the evergreen target for top line organic sales growth, volume and price.
Operator: That concludes our call. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Jim Craigie.
James R. Craigie: Thank you all very much for taking the time to be with us today. I would just wrap up by saying to you is we're very pleased with the solid Q2 results we've had. We honestly feel we have the right brands at the right price in this environment. We had very positive trends on 7 of 8 key business factors: the higher revenues, the more marketing spending in total dollars than year ago, higher shares on 5 of our 8 power brands, lower SG&A spending, higher adjusted EPS, higher income from operations and higher cash flow. I really think you can't beat that, scorecard is good. The only issue is lower gross margins driven by product mix, but we already have already programs in place to deliver higher gross margin in the second half. So we feel very, very confident about delivering our annual target of our -- on organic growth gross margin EPS. And let me just say, for those of you who sold Church & Dwight today, good luck with finding a better investment because you won't. So thank you very much for your time.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Jim Craigie - Chairman & CEO Matt Farell - EVP & CFO
Analysts: Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Marc Riddick - Williams Capital Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you on this call the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Jim Craigie: It's always a pleasure to talk to you particularly when we have outstanding results to report. I will start of this call by providing you with my perspective on our first quarter business results which you read about in our press release this morning. I will then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished I will return to provide some detailed information on the performance of our key brands and to discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We will then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very happy with the first quarter business results. We told you in February that we exited 2011 with strong momentum as reflected in our 7% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We continue that momentum in the first quarter of 2012 by delivering 8% organic revenue growth, our highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2008.  This outstanding organic revenue growth was driven by a 10% growth in our domestic business and 7% growth in our international business. The 10% organic growth in our domestic business was driven largely by 14% growth in our household business. Behind strong growth in our value-based fabric care business and innovative product news in our cat litter business. Our sales results are down slightly for our premium priced personal care brands due largely to the weak or declining category trends. However we gained market share on key power brands such as Trojan which achieved the second-highest quarterly share ever and first response which gained a full share point. These share gains should pay big dividends when the economic improves because we expect this category to return to historical growth rates. We also told you in February that we expected a lower gross margin in the first quarter of last year due to the continuing year-over-year domestic makes. However we are making progress on this front as the gross margin for the first quarter of 2012 was 50 basis points above the fourth quarter of 2011. The first quarter results also reflect that we tighten our belts on overhead costs, as SG&A as a percent of sales improved by 40 basis points. Don't be concerned about the lower marketing spending in Q1 and it is simply a function of timing. It was only a $1 million or roughly 2% below year-ago dollar spend. Also our organic growth was so exceptional from the first quarter at the spending levels that we decided to delay some marketing spending to later quarters where we are going to use more effectively behind new products. Most importantly we delivered a 13.8% increase in earnings per share which represents a strong start toward our annual EPS target of 9% to 10%. Now please don't start foaming at the mouth and raising our annual EPS target as Matt will surely explain why our 9% 10% annual EPS target is still appropriate. Those of you know me know that I have been a long-term pessimist about the business environment. I believe we will continue to face strong headwinds in 2012 including high commodity costs and weak consumer spending which will perpetuate competitive price for us. All consumer packages companies are fighting the same headwinds, but we believe that no other CPG company is as well-suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. I will explain my rationale for that statement in a few minutes after Matt provides you with greater insights from the financial results for the first quarter.
Matt Farrell: Thank you, Jim and good morning everybody. I will cover the EPS. First-quarter EPS was $0.66 per share compared with $0.58 in 2011. So EPS was up approximately 14% from a year ago. Reported revenues were up 7.5% to $691 million. Organic sales was 8.4% which excludes the impact of an acquisition and foreign exchange rate changes which together had a negative impact of 50 basis points. Organic sales includes 2011 sales in December resulting from customer orders made in anticipation of our January 2012 US systems upgrade. That particular adjustment accounted for a 1.4% of the 8.4% organic. The company believes such December sales would have occurred in the first quarter of 2012 where it not for the timing shift. Of the 8.4% organic growth approximately 10.5% is due to volume with 2.1% negative product mix and pricing and mostly product mix. Given our strong start, we now expect to deliver organic sales at the high end of our 3% to 4% annual target for the year. Now let's review the segments. The consumer domestic business' organic sales increased by 10.1% primarily due to higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent. Other products that contributed to volume growth were XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter and the introduction of ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BURST powerpack laundry detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER SpinBrush, Trojan condoms and ORAJEL oral analgesic products. Volume contributed approximately 3.4% of sales partially offset by the 3.3% negative effect of product mix and price and again mostly product mix. Organic sales includes an estimated 1.7% benefit from the timing shift that I discussed earlier with respect to customer orders from December that were pulled forward into January in anticipation of the US systems upgrade. Now International. International had 7% organic growth in Q1 due to higher sales in Canada, France, Australia and exports. This increase is driven by volume growth of 8.7% partially offset by 1.5% of product mix and price. For our specialty products division, organic sales were lower by 2.5% with volume down 8.1% and price up 5.6%. The price is driven generally in the animal nutrition business where we are recovering raw material costs. The organic decrease is primarily due to softness in our end markets especially in the dairy markets. Looking ahead to the balance of the year we now expect to be at the high-end of our 3% to 4% organic growth rate. We expect organic sales to be higher in the first half of 2012 as compared to the second half of 2012 as a result of easier comparisons in the first half. We continue to expect our value products particularly in the laundry category to continue to benefit from the weak economy and deliver strong organic growth. Now I'm going to cover gross margin. I reported first-quarter gross margin was 43.8% which is a 110 basis point contraction from a year ago. You may call that in February we expected Q1 gross margin to be a replay of Q4 2011 gross margin when gross margin was down year over year a 120 basis points. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to unfavorable product mix as net sales of lower margin consumer domestic household products rose 14.4% and net sales of higher margins consumer domestic personal care products were 2.6% lower. The other contributor to the contraction is a start-up of the new California plant which is on track to be fully operational in July. What is also noteworthy is that higher commodity costs in the quarter were offset by the effective cost reduction programs. Gross margin improved by 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Looking ahead first and second quarter, we expect second-quarter gross margin to be comparable for the first quarter due to a continuation of the product mix story. Because of the trend in product mix we expect full-year gross margin expansion to be at the lower end of our 25 to 50 basis point range for 2012. Our anticipated gross margin improvement is primarily a result of our cost savings programs outpacing commodity increases and product mix. So despite gross margin contraction in the first half we are confident in our ability to hit the lower end of annual 25 to 50 basis point target as a result of the following reasons. One is the absence of first half slotting. So slotting was very front-end loaded this year and larger year over year in the first half versus the first half of last year. Second is higher mix of personal care in the second half including some of our exciting new personal care products. And then finally cost savings programs are outpacing our cost increases and just some color on those cost savings programs. First one obviously would be the Victorville start up which as I said is going to be fully operational in July. The second is bringing unit dose laundry manufacturing in-house. You may recall that we said in the past to the first half of the year we would be manufacturing the parts out-house versus in-house. And the third is the benefits of our Simply Saline projects at two of our PC plants, personal care plants, one in the UK and one in the US that we are having lots of success with and those savings will be coming on in the second half of the this year. Then finally approximately two-thirds of our most voluble cost inputs are hedged for the second half of 2012, which gives us greater confidence with respect to our input costs.  Now I am going to cover marketing. Marketing spend for the first quarter was $68 million or 9.8% of revenues, which is 100 basis points below the prior year spend rate and slightly lower on the dollar spend. In spite of the slightly lower dollar spend, we grew dollar share in five of our eight power brands. This is due to the great execution by our sales and marketing teams. Looking ahead, we expect to increase spending for the balance of the year and now project full year marketing spends to be approximately 13% of sales. SG&A year-over-year was up $4 million from the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.3%, down 40 basis points from a year ago. The higher SG&A costs in the quarter reflect higher legal costs and costs associated with our information systems upgrades. For the full year, we expect a reduction of approximately 30 basis points to 13.1% of sales. This is a reflection of our continuous vigilance-to-control costs. With respect to operating profit, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 2.7% and that margin was 30 basis points higher than the prior year 20.4%. Now, equity in earnings from affiliates. Income from affiliates increased slightly due to the higher income from our joint ventures. On a full year basis, we expect a decrease about 3 million in part due to the start up of our Natronx joint venture. Other income was virtually unchanged in the quarter. We do not anticipate any material changes for the full year as compared to 2011 and income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% compared to last year 36.5%. The tax rate includes a 220 basis point benefit due to the settlement of an IRS audit. This of course translates into $0.02 of EPS help, but it’s purely timing. We anticipated this settlement to have in sometime in 2012 and we continue to expect the full year effective rate to be approximately 35%. So, no change since February. Now cash flow. We generated a $114 million of net cash from operations in the quarter which was $34 million higher than last year. We also spend $15 million in CapEx, a large percentage of which was for our California manufacturing distribution facility. If we net those two numbers together we come to approximately $99 million of free cash flow. So, a very strong quarter. And during the first quarter we purchased approximately 1.9 million shares at the total cost of $19 million. We continue to buy in April and purchased to $110 million or another 2.2 million shares and at this point we do not anticipate any further purchases for the balance of the year. At quarter end, we had over $230 million of cash on hand and approximately $500 million available credits to our revolver and a commitment to increase that feature should we choose to for an additional $500 million. And I told that to LTM adjusted EBITDA for our bank agreement was approximately 0.5 times. So, clearly an unlevered company. In conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 8.4% organic sales growth, driven by 10% volume growth, an increase in share of five of our eight power brands and a healthy 20.7% operating margin. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.54 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. Remember last year’s second quarter included a $0.04 per share tax benefit as a result of New Jersey’s corporate tax reform. If you look at that full year we are expecting a balanced year for EPS when comparing the first half EPS to second half EPS or maintaining our annual earning per share goal of 241 to 243 for the year, which is an increases 14% to 15% over last year’s reported $2.12 and 9% to 10% higher if we exclude the fourth quarter 2011 deferred tax charge. Back to you, Jim.
Jim Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I’ll finish off our call by adding a little color to the outstanding first quarter business result that Matt just took you through and my outlook on the year. Our great first quarter business is also directly linked to seven factors that support my earlier statement that we believe that no other consumer packages company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough business environment. First, we have the most unique product portfolio in the CPG industry. It consists both premium and value brands which put us in position of pride in any type of economy, as exemplified by our consistently strong EPS growth over the past 10 years. In particular, our value brands representing about 40% of our revenue based, have experience strong growth in this recessionary economy as consumers are making smart choices by switching to and staying with our high quality but lower price brands. A great example of this is the fact that our value based ARM & HAMMER Laundry Detergent business was up double-digit in sales growth in the first quarter and outpaced all the liquid and powdered detergent brands. We (inaudible) this strong sales and share growth to continue in 2012. So ARM & HAMMER brand becomes a number two liquid laundry detergent brand in America. The second factor which is the key driver of Church & Dwight success is that we have a proven record of our driving our power brand. We have 80 brands but eight of these brands are our power brand that’s showing 80% of our sales and profits. From 2008 to 2011, we grew market share on these eight power brands in almost 80 % of the quarters. In the first quarter of this year, we grew market share of five our eight power brands. Two key factors for those excellent share results. First, we have effectively reinvested some of the increased profits from a strong growth of our value brands to selectively increase marketing support our eight power brands by a total of a 130 basis points between 2007 and 2011. While our marketing spending was slightly lower in dollar versus year ago in the first quarter of 2012, please keep in mind that we traditionally spend the bulk of our advertising dollars in the second to the fourth quarters to support the launch of our new products. And we do intend to do spend more marketing dollars in the remaining three quarters of 2012 to support continuous share growth on our power brands. The other factor driving the growth of our power brands is the robust pipeline of new products. Over the past four years, new products delivered about 50% of the company’s organic revenue growth. We plan to ship innovative new products in every key category this year. This fourth delivery of organic growth target is 3% to 4%. We expect these new products to be as successful as new products we introduced over the past four years. A sample of this new products include a new sensitive skin product on our ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent line has significantly enhanced the brands appeal to the 52% consumer households who have sensitive skin issues. This will help to drive continued growth in ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent business, which has achieved 12 consecutive quarter of growth and continues to grow faster than all other liquid laundry detergents brands. Another great new product being launched in 2012 is ARM & HAMMER Ultra Last Cat Litter. Every granule of this new Cat Litter is coated with baking soda to deliver long lasting odor control. Ultra Last is off to a great start and follows it’s hugely successful launch of ARM & HAMMER Double Duty Cat Litter line in 2010. As a result of the steady stream of great new product introductions the ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter brand achieved its all time high quarterly share in the first quarter and has now achieved 33 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, 12 consecutive quarters of share gain and is now the clear number two brand in pumping cat litter business and is closing in on number one. That's pretty impressive for our category which we entered only 14 years ago. It also shows a strong consumer [POP] ARM & HAMMER brand which now accounts for over $1 billion in total sales. On the personal care side of our business we have several exciting new products in 2012. First is our new toothpaste for sensitive teeth which combines two of our power brands, ARM & HAMMER and ORAJEL to provide maximum pain relief in a lower bracing formula that is gentle on enamel. Another new product in the oral care category is TOOTH TUNES which provide manual toothbrushes for young children and uses proprietary technology to place two minutes of music from a broad range of artists. This product will begin shipping in the second half of 2012. For those of you with young children, I guarantee that if they use a TOOTH TUNES toothbrush you will have to yell at your kids to stop brushing instead of yelling at them to brush. TOOTH TUNES represents our first entry in the $800 million manual toothbrush category. We are also pursuing two other high margin wide space categories to help drive the company's future growth. First is a Vibrator category which is over $500 million in size with no major brand and players. We first entered this category in 2005 with electronics TROJAN brand and this year we are launching full size vibrators in the new channels. Second we have entered the dish washing additives category which is over $100 million in size via the OXICLEAN brand. The government mandated removal of phosphates from dish washing detergents and is thus created a need for a Booster product to deal with a notable increase in ceramic glasses and dishes. Our new OXICLEAN dish washing Booster product Booster Clean for our dishwashing detergents that once again deliver crystal clear dishware. There are many other new products that we are launching in 2012, but in the interest of time I will move out with my review of the factors driving switching to our continued success and discuss our updated earnings guidance on the year. Let me quickly run through five of the key factors of our success. Number three is we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands as evidenced by our successful defense of the OXICLEAN brand when a large competitive entered the category two years ago. The fourth factor behind our continued success is the strong growth in our international business; while our international business represents only 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high single digit sales growth and double digit operating profit growth over the past five years. This strong growth continued in the first quarter as Matt mentioned earlier. Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding growth margins through cost optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher margin new products. We expanded gross margin by 1,550 basis points in the past 10 years. We did not improve our gross margins in 2010 and 2011; we were successful in holding on to 380 of the 430 basis points gain we achieved in 2009 despite major headwinds from commodity costs. As Matt told you earlier, our gross margin declined 110 basis points from the first quarter, but that was in line with our expectations and 50 basis points above the prior quarter. We have initiatives in place to achieve our gross margin target of 25 to 50 basis points improvement in 2012 although the strong household mix may drive it to the lower end of that range. And we are picking longer term actions to drive continued gross margin growth in future years. For example, as Matt told you in late May, we began production of new manufacturing facility is Southern California. This plant will enable us to look forward to continuing strong volume growth of both our Liquid Laundry and Cat Litter businesses, and position these businesses to be among the industry leaders in low-cost production and distribution. Factor number six is our ability to tightly manage our overhead costs. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major Consumer Packages Company. As mentioned earlier, our overhead costs were down 40 basis points from the first quarter versus year ago which reflects how aggressively we manage our overhead costs to stay best-in-class in our industry. Finally, factor number seven is our strong record on free cash flow conversion. We’ve almost quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past five years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income was 128%, which was best-in-class in our industry. As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we continue to improve in the first quarter as our free cash flow was 36% above year ago. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain including construction of more efficient new plants and acquisitions of higher margin and faster growing leading brands. All these factors give me great confidence of our ability to deliver our aggressive 2012 business targets despite a very tough business environment facing all companies these days. In my biased opinion, no other Consumer Packages Company is well suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment. We were delivering exceptional earnings per share growth before the recession; we are delivering exceptional earning per share growth during the recession and we are taking actions to ensure that we continue to deliver exceptional earning per share growth going forward regardless of the future economic environment. Let me switch gears now and simply talk about our outlook for the rest of 2012. As stated in the press release, as a result of the fact that our first quarter results were strong, we remain confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate of $2.41 to $2.43, which is an increase of 9% to 10% over 2011 adjusted earning per share. We strongly believe that we can deliver this aggressive EPS targets just like continued expected headwinds on higher commodity costs and weaker consumer demand. Our confidence delivering these aggressive targets is based on two key factors. First, we strongly believe that we can deliver the market share gains in our power brands to deliver our target of 3% to 4% organic growth. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands and consistent marketing support. All three of these factors have contributed to continued organic growth. But the growth will not be as strong in the second half of 2012 because it will be up against stronger getting sales in the second half of 2011. Second we strongly believe we can deliver gross margin expansion of 25 to basis points despite being down 110 basis points in Q1, although that mix may drive us to the lower end of the range. Our gross margin expansion is expected to result from the factors that Matt mentioned earlier. And keep in mind that we’ll be clomping over gross margins in the back half of 2011 that were lower than the front half. Three, other points that I would like to make before I turn the call over to questions. First, achieving our 2012 EPS target is not depended upon making an acquisition. We aggressively pursued a lot of acquisition opportunities over the past year. We have not been able to find a major acquisition at the right price that meets our acquisition criteria. Second, I want to assure you that we are fully aware of the threat posed by competitive marketing initiatives and new products being launched by our competitors in the second half of 2012. As I told you earlier, Church & Dwight’s greatest strength is in the building and ferociously defend our brand. We have compared the new list against any future competitive threat. Third, although we had a great first quarter with 13.8% EPS growth, please do not expect or forecast higher earnings for the year than our forecast of 9% to 10% growth. Our $0.97 EPS growth target is already higher than almost all other CPG competitors. If things go better than we expect with regards to 2012, we will reinvest back into higher marketing spending in the second half to ensure that we exit 2012 with strong momentum, just like we exited 2011. In conclusion 2012 is shaping up to be another very challenging year due to the weak consumer demand and high commodity prices. Well when things get ugly or stay ugly you should place your bets on the company with the product portfolio that can thrive in any environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage their portfolio to deliver strong earnings per share growth. Now that ends our presentation. I'll open the call to questions that you may have which Matt and I'll do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: (Operator). And your first question comes from Bill [Tapel].
Unidentified Analyst: This is [Sarah] on for Bill. I just have a couple of questions about with the laundry pod. I'm wondering if you can give us some color on the pods business and how you saw initial sellthrough, how the growth progressed through the quarter and what you see growth trajectory looking like in the next couple of quarters? And then was your -- were you able to gain incremental shop space at your key retailers or was it more replacement shop space, just kind of give us some color around that?
Jim Craigie: It's really too early to really give a good forecast in the pods. We were out early, our distribution was almost entirely incremental. It's off to an okay – a good start, a very good start, but it's really too early. It's just the latest four week share that is coming in. It's really early for everybody. Marketing support in a big way it is just beginning to start and the same is true for our competitors. So it's really too early to say how big the pods category will be and how everybody is doing. We are very happy with our start. Again the distribution was terrific, it was incremental and the initial takeaway by consumers is looking good, but again it's just too early I use that as a projection vehicle.
Unidentified Analyst: And then if I could, just one follow-up to that question. Given how early it is in the market, can you talk about your competence level with the capacity that you have and being able to support the business coming inhouse?
Jim Craigie: Yeah we feel very confident. You know like I said the product is coming inhouse by the end of Q2 and we will have plenty of capacity to meet demand to that product.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill (inaudible).
Unidentified Analyst: It is (inaudible) on for Bill. Another laundry question, can you guys just tell us how much total of the US laundry volume was up in the quarter because I mean if I look at the scanner data it looks like it probably came in a whole lot better than the data would suggest even considering the prebuys. So any help there will be appreciated?
Jim Craigie: Yeah Nick the laundry category exhibited a little bit more growth in the first quarter than some in the past, but it's not good. But nothing to shock folks with, we are more impressed by the fact that we had very strong share gains as we've had for the last couple of years. We continue to outpace the category as consumers trade down to our great value brands, but it was a good quarter, but I wouldn't say these trend so far, so let's see what happens over the rest of 2012.
Unidentified Analyst: Then if you don’t mind, could you just comment a little further on the acquisition environment? I mean if there has been any meaningful changes since we last spoke?
Jim Craigie: I would just tell you that we don't discuss any specific details on M&A. I would tell you the environment is very active and we are very involved, but we have very specific acquisition criteria of looking only for leading brands and margin accretive brands and asset light brands. So far there's been nothing that was acquired by somebody that we regret and we're actively looking for acquisitions that fit that bill but that's about as far as I can go.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Tim (inaudible).
Unidentified Analyst: Just a couple here. I guess to add on to that acquisition question, Jim do you think the environment will accelerate as we push towards the year end? Again we've seen this movie before and it didn't quite, the rules changed right near the end, but with the tax situation as it sits now and if they are for private companies, do you think there's a motivation there to get things done, number one? Then you touched on it, but if you could give a little bit more color about your large competitor's commentary to rollback prices in certain categories and how that may impact you?
Jim Craigie: I've been wrong before about the acquisition environment. I think like you're insinuating that the lot of factors are going on with organic growth being tough for a lot of companies. Tax law changes in the future potentially that it would accelerate it. I would tell you that there is more activity out there as far as opportunities for deals, but it has materialized in deals quite honestly. So I don't know. I would tell you I think sellers still are a little bit lofty on what they think they can get for their businesses and so it's kind of, you would think and I think you're right. I thought I was right in the past thing. I thought activity would pick up and it hasn't happened, but you never know, so stay tuned. On our competitor rolling back prices I would say that only affects us in one category being powdered laundry detergents. We did take pricing in that category and we intend to maintain that price increase.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then one other maybe a little off-to-the-side question here. Again your powder brands are doing well, you guys continued the great track record of execution. Any thoughts at this point about further SKU rationalization in those pieces that generate only about 20% of sales that maybe a lesser piece of margin?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes absolutely Tim. It's an understatement to say you have no idea of the pressure inside this company to deliver our gross margin targets and that is leading to intense detail on every business, SKUs, small brands. You have no idea we even own out there that are small. We're looking under every rock in this company to find anything that delivers a low margin and either we can discontinue the SKU or even discontinue some tiny brands out of our 80 brands and like you don't know some of them, most people don't know some of them. So we're doing everything possible to drive our gross margin targets this year and into the future and that's resulting in intense scrutiny on every SKU in our portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason (inaudible).
Unidentified Analyst: So I guess the first question I wanted to talk about is the personal care side and I know you have confidence in the second half, but obviously the business has been a little bit soft. So when we think about the guidance that you're providing, the gross margin obviously needs to see the negative mix turn a little bit more neutral with personal care coming back. But at the same point I guess I'm just trying to see what type of contingency plan do you have if personal care doesn't get better and household still continues to deliver? I don't have any doubt about the EPS, but I'm wondering about the composition of your earnings growth next year or for this year, if the gross margin comes in lower because of personal care. So may be lead off of that as the first question?
Jim Craigie: So Jason we're feeling pretty good about personal care in the back half there. First of all we're lapping some pretty weak category trends in the back half of last year. And secondly, we have a whole slew of new products launching in the back half the year. So as I mentioned things like the TOOTH TUNES and that. So we are feeling pretty confident and you know us, we always had contingency plans to make our numbers and it wouldn’t be a worst thing in the world of our household business continue to -- it was raging growth and maybe the mix for the gross margin little bit, we make our EPS with, that’s what we get paid to do. It’s a lots on the levers and we will deliver that EPS and things change out there and we will adjust to it, but back to your further point is, we feel pretty damn good about the personal care business in the back half for the reasons I told you.
Unidentified Analyst: And then, just I guess kind of housekeeping related, what’s your expectation for the specialty business, because I mean the organic sales I think it was a little bit weaker this quarter than we saw last year, so you are expecting negative organic sales, so hence the high end of the three to four is really going to be more consumer than maybe specialty helped that last year?
Jim Craigie: Yeah that’s fair Jason. We got off to a very soft January and February, March and April ticked up, but it’s a bit of hole for us to fill that on a full year basis for the specialty business. So yeah as far as on a full year basis the driver is going to be in the consumer business almost (inaudible). Don’t forget that the specialty business has a lower gross margins, so to the extent that it’s a little week that actually again houses make our corporate gross margin targets.
Unidentified Analyst: And then I guess just a last question, thinking about some of you brands that obviously if you have a strong following in the US like TROJAN or First Response, but not really getting that global expansion. I know, I am just wondering how do you guys talk internally with the Board just about how to get the real growth opportunities that are out there outside of really North America whether it’s Canada, Mexico, the US but certainly it still seems to be a huge opportunity for many of your categories and your brands and I was just wondering how you guys think about that over the next few years?
Jim Craigie: Jason we do think about a lot. We don't really talk to you guys a lot, but I mean I can tell you First Response hit record shares in Canada and Australia this latest quarter. TROJAN hit a record share up in Canada and had a very strong quarter down in Mexico. So we are looking as best as possible to take our US brands outside of the US and grow, but we use good reasons. In some cases they have lag, in some cases they don't. We've been driving share growth on ARM & HAMMER toothpaste over in the UK, we are still doing that again maybe our fault we don't talk about enough, but we are looking to as much as possible globalize some of our key brands, but we do it smartly. We got to look at the market overseas, where the competitors are and what kind of equity we believe we can have and where we've done it, we've taken first response into Australia and so it’s a leading share brand and we've driven up in Canada and other countries. So maybe we should talk about it more in the future, but we are looking for that. And then we look for strong brands in overseas market. You don't know the fact we have two or three local brands up in Canada that are market leaders like [Gravel] and that is up there I think, up (inaudible) from that. So maybe in fairness we should talk about more of that in the future so you’ll understand what we are doing better.
Unidentified Analyst: And actually I am just going to throw one last one, you talked about the new channels with the vibration category, you picked my interest, so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that?
Jim Craigie: Well, those are channels that you largely visit to the adult store channels out there and that’s actually the largest seller of adult products right now. So we have joined that channel, it’s a little more difficult than other channels because there's a few change and then there's a lot of mom and pops and so it’s a little slower distribution build, but right now it’s the largest seller of vibration type products and we are making a full force effort through our distributors in that to get into that channel with that product.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Alice Longley [Buckingham Research]
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: I hope I didn't miss this; I think you said second quarter sales would be strong, did you specify where organic sales growth should be then? And then could you say something about this recall of Spinbrush and how much that might affect sales?
Matt Farrell: No, we did not call second quarter top-line. We just said we expected another strong quarter.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: What does that mean, stronger than three to four?
Jim Craigie: We've said on the year, we think we’ll now finish it at the high end of our 3% to 4% range.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: And are you going to beat that in the second quarter and then be below that in the second half, that's my question?
Jim Craigie: Don't forget the pacing of our last year; organic growth last year from Q1 to Q4 went 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%. So this year we are starting up against weaker comps last year, but we end up again stronger comps in the back half, so we’ve kind of guide everybody that think the opposite way this year, organic growth will start very strong and then as we lap big numbers in the back half it will get lower. Saying the opposite is true for gross margin. Our stronger gross margins occurred in the front half of last year and the ones in the back half are weaker. so that's why we are telling you we think we will have gross margin outside in the back half of the year to get to our targeted 25 to 50 basis points. So that now were because the product mix we are seeing maybe toward the lower end of that target. So that's about as clear as we've been on those two factors.
Matt Farrell: Alice, the only line item call on the second quarter was we said that the gross margin in the second quarter will be comparable to the first quarter, so we have strong sales. But we don't, we are not calling the individual items on the P&L, just the EPS we said was around $0.54.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: The last comps I think last year it sounds really tough in the second half because it was 7% in the fourth quarter but that was partly a calendar issue and your calendar is pretty similar this year, right?
Matt Farrell: No, calendar issue.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay. So I guess my question, would your sales be up in the second half, will your organic sales be up in the second half?
Jim Craigie: Sure, yes.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: And then what about that recall?
Matt Farrell: The recall, as we said in the release that we’ve recalled selected lots of Spinbrush, Rechargeable SONIC toothbrushes distributed between the day seven when they were released and we said that they are also it was a material item both to the second quarter and to the full year and the only context that I can give you is the annual sales of this particular Rechargeable SONIC toothbrush is less than $2 million.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: And then on the personal care category you highlighted that the decline was the categories, and you gained share was TROJAN and First Response; so how much of your category is declining in personal care?
Jim Craigie: Very weak, we’ve had some categories like battery toothbrush is down about 3% toothache was down about 2% and then the condoms and diagnostics categories were up less than 1% that we consider to be weak. So, overall weakness, that’s pretty common to all the industry as they are higher margin and more discretionary category, so those category traditionally grow in the 3% to 5% range. So we think that growth will come back when the economy comes back; in the mean time, like I said we are happy just pounding away at growing our shares in those categories.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Well, its sound from the numbers you just gave us, your category is sort of flat down one or something and you were down more than that so its sound if actually lost share?
Jim Craigie: That’s not what I said. I told you TROJAN gained half a share point; First Response gained full share point in those category. So we’re gaining share in some key categories that are just relatively weak or slightly down.
Operator: And your next question comes from Joe [Altobello].
Unidentified Analyst: Just a couple of quick ones. I guess first on, in terms of the overall market growth you know Jim you've been pretty downbeat for a while and obviously been correct here. Have things gotten worse incrementally thus far in 2012 and secondly on that point have you seen any impact in your categories. Are they good or bad for you in terms of higher gas prices?
Jim Craigie: No, Joe it has kind of plateaued. It's kind of in a stall rate now out there in the categories which I honestly think we will continue for a little while ahead. You know again who knows what the election will do with the economy in that or what will happen around the world, but I call it kind of a plateau. I really haven’t seen the gas thing, it's hard to translate through. I would say consumer package get a little more insulated from that, but other more discretionary things like going up to restaurants or buying items that you don’t really need. You have to eat, you have to brush your teeth and you have to wash your cloth and things like that. So I would think. I don’t think it's being as much an impact as it has been on going out the outer restaurants and things like that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. so to make the link between the growth in household and high gas prices, that’s not a driver?
Jim Craigie: I wouldn’t, I don’t think this as much. I mean there is a lot you know there is a lot of things going on out there. I don’t think it’s a bigger driver as in other businesses.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just secondly in terms of the marketing expense, is there a mix impact on marketing given the fact that your household businesses are growing so much faster?
Jim Craigie: No, not really Joe we pretty much planned flat dollar spending in the first quarter and then our volume exploded on is more in the household side. So again on a basis points or a percent of that revenue it doesn’t look pretty, but it was pretty much in line with what we expected to spend and I told you we always plan to spend more money in the second through the fourth quarter because that's when our new product is launched and it is always more effective to launch and spend money against new product news and against the old product line. So, that was just numbers games going on with marketing spending more than anything else. So we are very happy that we have lots of dry powder left to the back three quarters.
Operator: Thank you next question is from Connie (inaudible).
Unidentified Analyst: I have a question. Earlier in the year you had some caution about the liquid laundry detergent category as unit dosing started to become part of it. So, I was wondering if you could describe what dynamics you think would be healthy for the category if unit dosing is successful?
Jim Craigie: The first quarter of that category in the food, drug and mass channels is only up a little less than 2%. We are kind of looking back at what happened in laundry additives a couple of years ago when a major competitor entered the category. And when that happened, some big product news, a lot of spending went on. And the category had very strong growth rates for the first four quarters and then it fell back and went negative for the last four or five quarters. Again, you never know this is a huge category. It is like a $6 billion category versus that $1 billion category for laundry additive. So, I would think in this case with every competitor out there launching the pod, every competitor spending some kind of decent money to support those pods that I would expect to see some pretty strong category numbers maybe up in the mid high single digits on liquid laundry detergent for maybe three or four quarters and then the key thing will be repeat, how do customers react to it. It is going to be the highest price per wash for the laundry detergent out there which was pretty tough in a recessionary type economy, but the consumers will try it. There will be a lot of incentives to try it and the key thing will be when it goes back to its normal high prices and there's less incentives what the repeat purchases will be and again that will happen about a year after the products are launched.
Unidentified Analyst: So are the pods considered a part of liquid laundry because they are different forms, some of them are just powder and some are part liquid, part powder, how is that categories done, once investment spending is over, is it profit accretive in the category?
Jim Craigie: We are honestly tracking it as a separate category, but we look at it in combination with the liquid laundry detergent category. And the accretion, every company has got their own numbers as far as this product which is pretty expensive to make versus other stuff, but it is going to be sold at a higher price for wash load. So I can only speak for ourselves. At long term, this will be accretive and we will just have to see how much we sell and how well it does.
Operator: Your next question is from Caroline [Levy].
Unidentified Analyst:  A couple of questions. I don't know if you addressed this but I understand Maureen has left, who should we be calling with questions?
Matt Farrell: I am the lucky one. This is Matt Farrell.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, Matt good, so I am assuming it will take a while for you to replace. So you have not planned at this point?
Matt Farrell: Yeah big shoes to fill.
Unidentified Analyst: Secondly, my question is sort of around how much of the demand growth you've seen in laundry is coming from consumers being stretched. So that geographically, do you see a difference where your market shares are significantly higher and you're growing faster in the toughest economies in the US?
Jim Craigie: Caroline it is a very good question. Quite honestly, we haven't seen anything like that. I think you would see the economic pain is pretty spread across the country, but it is an interesting one, we really haven't looked into that kind of intense detail as to whether some higher markets maybe like a New York city compares to a very rural market, but, good question. I'll ask my troops to take a look at it, but I don't think there is anything that different, quite honestly across the markets right now.
Unidentified Analyst: I am just trying to understand if the economy ever improves and whether you can hold on to your share or not?
Jim Craigie: We will, we have lots of research data that show that consumers who have traded down and now have repeatedly tried our products over the last several years since this recession kind of kicked in 2008 are sticky with the brand even whether or not they get their jobs back or make more money in that. They have found that we truly produced a great laundry detergent and they can save you know a lot of money by buying us versus the higher priced brands.
Unidentified Analyst: Right and then if you were to suddenly see your volumes drop off a lot as a result of Procter discounting, would you take action? I mean are there certain levels that you are you will defend?
Jim Craigie: We always maintain careful price gaps versus all of our competitors and do take action when things like that happen. So yeah we do, we have a lot of scientific studies that tell us what price gaps we have to maintain and again across every brand against every competitor and we do I think we have quite a good reputation for knowing it. We take action very quickly when we see things that either close those gaps and we have to respond by lowering prices or some times increase the gaps so we take advantage of it by raising our prices.
Unidentified Analyst : Right, I notice I think you said you are not going to buy any motions back this year. Is that right?
Matt Farrell: Not after April, we brought back in 
Unidentified Analyst : Don’t you have ample cash flow, I mean, because I think you know is this typical that you just do your certain amount or do you need further authorization?
Matt Farrell: Yeah, we actually hadn’t brought back shares for over ten years until late in 2011 and this is a company that generates significant amount of free cash flow and we were building lot of excess cash. So obviously through the outlook, our dividend and buyback, and in February we raised our dividend again in 2011, we had doubled it, and in 2012 February we took it up again. So we are now at a 40% pay out and then the buyback of shares that we started in late 2011, we continued in March. So we said in February we would buy at least as much as we brought last year at a minimum and likely increase it and you are correct in that we generate lot of cash and in the first quarter we generated almost a $100 million of free cash flow and then at the quarter with 230 million of cash. We have an authorization of about $300 million. So we are going to start bumping up against that. So we would need another authorization of a similar size to continue what we have been doing for the last two months.
Unidentified Analyst : It is just the way you say that sounded pretty (inaudible) that you are not going to do more. Is that open for discussion?
Matt Farrell: Not for this year.
Unidentified Analyst : This year.
Matt Farrell: Yes, that’s correct.
Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then do you think marketing expense in the second quarter will be up a little bit, actual dollars?
Matt Farrell: Yeah, we expect marketing to increase in the second quarter from. You’re talking about from the first quarter or year-over-year?
Unidentified Analyst : Year-over-year.
Matt Farrell: Year-over-year it will be up.
Unidentified Analyst : But the real increase, the more dramatic increase will be in the back half. Is that what you are expecting?
Matt Farrell: Well, we are expecting it to increase the rest of the year actually because on a full year basis, we are expecting 13% on starting at that 10.8% and reason why we, the first quarter is typically low-ish because we don’t have full distribution on our new products. So it is common for us to have higher marketing spending in Q2, Q3 and Q4 and then Q1.
Unidentified Analyst : Right. And if gross margin doesn’t do everything you hope it will, would you adapt to marketing expense that you will make your targeted EPS growth?
Matt Farrell: Marketing isn’t the only area we look at and we look across the board and make the leverage. So we are not going our goal really in the year is to increase and get that 15% and if there is upside, which I think there is more chance of now. Than down side we would spend that more on marketing to exit the year. It will add to a great momentum 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from [Erin Lash].
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the acquisition environment and specifically what areas you would be looking to either build out your portfolio or build out your geographic reach on growth and acquisition?
Jim Craigie: We are pretty agnostic on that. We have consistently said over time, we look for our criteria again. Number one and number two share brands, margin accretive brands, growth accretive brands that we think we can grow steadily, and asset like brands. And I think our history has shown that we’ll look at almost any category and any geography doing that. Keep in mind, I mean, today we make products and almost every type of product, liquids, powders, rolls on sticks, rubbers, sprays and everything. So that holds the door to look at a lot of other categories because we can bring those products into our plans and save a lot of money from the current orders. No, we’re pretty agnostic and we did, our most recent acquisition was the BATISTE hair spray brand over the UK. We’ve never been in hair spray. It’s UK, which is one of our smaller markets but we got into that business. We happen to make aerosols in our UK plant. So we brought, we are bringing that product in house to help us save money, drive our gross margins north and just one of the fastest growing hair spray brands in the UK market. And it’s also a fantastic start. So that just shows you nobody would ever have thought we would have gone in the hair spray business. We've found a great opportunity, higher margin; high growth, asset life, great gross margins and we bought that business.
Unidentified Analyst: And just follow-up and I apologize if I missed this but what is your expectation, have you provided an expectation for commodity costs for the year?
Matt Farrell: We haven't, other than to save it, we don't expect them to, we don't expect that to be down year-over-year, commodity costs are higher for us year-over-year. We did say that we are hedged. So we are not as concerned about movements in the second half for the remainder of the year actually.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from [Thomas Wilkin].
Unidentified Analyst: Going back to the 40% payout ratio for dividends, that's the highest payout ratio in the last 11 years and percentage wise a big increase in the dividend. Does this reflect a change in philosophy at the board level; we are seeing this at other companies. I wonder whether you would comment whether there's more emphasis now on dividends versus buybacks.
Matt Farrell: Yeah, historically the company for many years had a payout ratio of somewhere between 10% and 15% and as the company has become a lot, lot bigger over time with more and more power brands and generated significantly more free cash flow on an annual basis. The company has realized that we generate a lot of excess cash. So we slowly have being bringing it up. So we went from 15% to 30% payout a year ago and then we took it up to 40% payout this February. The philosophy frankly is that the company's strategy were (inaudible) company. So we always want to have plenty of capacity to acquire and add to our power brands and over the period of time we have now, we were BBB rated. That was far, different story several years ago. So the company's access to the capital markets is significantly greater than it was historically. So therefore we have the excess cash, the excess of the capital markets convinces us. So we don't need to hang on to that cash and that we can take the dividend up and pay money back to our shareholders, and then take some shares out and at least cover share creep on annual basis, and then some if we have additional cash.
Unidentified Analyst : But do you think the board has preference now for dividends versus buybacks.
Matt Farrell: No, no. Once you declare a dividend its apparent, right? So we are going to be, we have been paying dividends for, I don't know, how many; 100 years? So, we continue to pay, we are going to continue to pay dividend.
Unidentified Analyst: Let me word my question in other way. Percentage wise, using your free cash flow for dividends or buybacks, the allocation for dividends is increasing now. Right?
Matt Farrell: As far as the dividends go, we can only comment on what we've declared as dividends today and we cannot project in future what our, if there are going to be future increases. That's something that the board and management evaluates on an annual basis; as far as we can go on that topic.
Operator: Your next question is from Marc Riddick [Williams Capital].
Marc Riddick - Williams Capital: I was wondering about the comment you mentioned on the trading down process for your brands and sort of consistent with that it seem as though retailers are not – and sort of pulled back from embracing or at least aggressively pursuing private label in store brand compared to maybe where they were a couple of years to go. And if that’s the case and you consider that my view it doesn’t have to be yours, but if that’s the case I was wondering then provide you a different view or impact how you are looking at marketing for the remainder of the year or maybe sort of addressing maybe target areas that you might look at?
Jim Craigie: Well Marc, it’s a good insight. In our 13 categories, private label only have a meaningful presence, so what I mean by that more than say 10 share points in about three of those categories. And the history of private label has been that only in categories we it has a meaningful presence does it really cause some harm during economic tough times. So first of all I said, we face private label only in a very few of our categories. And retail, always have a tough time on growing; you would see overall private labels been creeping due to the economic, but again its very small piece of majority of categories. Now most of the people buying our products Marc have just as you’ve seen the fact that you know they’ve tried them, they were facing some tighter to pocket books, they have always heard about our great brands and they tried them and they found out how terrific they are. The growth rates we’re seeing, I think (inaudible) and it’s just fantastic and proving that people didn’t just try it once and run back to other brand, they tried it, realized how good it was, they repeated it and called that sheer requirements; how many of your annual purchases you make from a particular brand and we are seeing our share requirements to grow steadily. Brands like ARM & HAMMER, people find out how great they are, people forget too we have several forms of that brand, we have ARM & HAMMER with OXICLEAN. We have ARM & HAMMER laundry detergents for sensitive skin so we have all the variety that the premium brands have, but we offer a bit more of a value prices. So people who need them for whatever purpose again more powerful cleaners with like OXICLEAN and or sensitive skin we have those varieties and the people can say quite a bit of money, I mean on a 150 ounce jug of laundry detergent you will save $9 by buying ARM & HAMMER versus the premium brand and that's quite a bit of money in today's pocket book.
Marc Riddick - Williams Capital: And I agree with those sentiments, but from the standpoint of, would you say that do you still think you have to communicate that to the retailers, because from the standpoint of understanding the consumer behavior, I get that there's trade down and then the trade across or whatever it maybe, the consumers get it, they are happy with it, and their behavior becomes sticky, do you find yourself continuing to how to educate the retailers that this is the case and then from that standpoint future shelf space gains maybe possible?
Jim Craigie: Well, tough question; I mean retailers are very under support for private label. Some are very focused on growing their private label and had very minimal private label. For those who have minimal private label they are all about big brands. They love our brands and push them. For those that have private label businesses, we do what we constantly do to educate them about the power of having our brands as part of their portfolio. And again the growth rate, they just can't deny how fast our brands are growing and as they are behind our brands like ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, they are losing out the marketplace right now and that led to a lot of distribution gains for us and a lot of share growth over the past several years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Leigh Ferst [Wellington Shields]
Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields: I have a question about how you are discussing your gross margin progression and I realized you probably analyze this from a lot of different point of view. But you are talking about on a sequential quarterly basis more than your year-over-year; and I was wondering if you could tell us the reason why you’re set up to do with the commodity environment or something else?
Jim Craigie: Now the way to think about it is this. In the first half of the year, we have the mix issue obviously hurting us and when we’re saying that that’s going to get a little bit better in the second half and one of the reasons for that what I said was that we have a little more balance in personal care in the second half from compared to household versus the first half. I remember we have some new products something like TOOTH TUNES in the second half that are going to help us. We also are slotting that’s very front end loaded this is year. So slotting is another drag on gross margin and there is an absence of that in the second half. The third thing which would be price, so we have taken price selectively on some brands in the first quarter. And those would for example, (inaudible) and natural, just the natural layer and also baking soda. But that’s really being offset by the slotting. So as you move to the year and we get to the second half we get the benefit of that, so that’s a plus in the second half. The other thing is that we have to develop our plant, that with startup cost in the first half, we don’t have those startup cost in the second half. We are manufacturing the unit those, or pods outsider third party in the first half. We are not making it in our house in the second half. And then we have a number of programs with two of our personal care plants, one in Folkestone, UK and then in the Lakewood, New Jersey where we expect to get the benefits of the completion of certain projects starting in the third quarter. So there are a number of things that benefit the second half that are not in the first half. So that's the way to think about why on a year-over-year basis, we think we are going to be showing positive gains in the second half versus the first half.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. Please go ahead with your closing remarks.
Jim Craigie: Okay, everybody. Again, this is Jim Craigie; I want to thank you all for taking the time to listen to our first quarter results. Again, we are very thrilled with those results. We've given you our outlook on the year which I think is consistent with what you expect from us overtime. So with that, if you have any questions, follow-up, call in Matt and I wish you all a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s Q1 2012 earnings call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-07 00:00:00) =====
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. My name is Matt Farrell. I'm the CFO of Church & Dwight. 
 And before we begin, this conference call will include forward-looking statements. These statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. For information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement on Forward-looking Statements.
 We will discuss organic sales growth, including -- pardon me, excluding foreign exchange effective tax rate, acquisitions and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, excluding the impact of the onetime items described in today's press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.churchdwight.com.
 Now let me turn the podium over to Jim Craigie for his opening remarks. 
James Craigie: Thank you, Matt, for covering that exciting part of the presentation today. Once again, good afternoon to all of you, and welcome to the epicenter of capitalism on planet Earth, here in the boardroom of New York Stock Exchange. And I want to say, I mean, I know we had some great Q4 results, but throwing us a parade was just over-the-top, I really appreciate that.
 I'm going to start today's presentation by doing something a little different. Since we are in New York, I'm going to give you an executive summary of the entire presentation in what they call a New York minute or 2 minutes. If you pay attention for the next 60 to 120 seconds, you're going to hear a summary of the 5 key points that are going to be made today.
 And then Matt and I will give you a longer version of the presentation. We've got some pretty charts, which help support these points. We'll then open the floor to you for questions. We'll do our best to answer those questions. So sit back, if you haven't finished your lunch, keep enjoying it. If you want to go back for seconds, go back there and get some. And Matt and I will tell you about our great company.
 So here's the executive summary. Here's the 5 things I want you to takeaway. I mean, first, if you follow the Giants, one of the great things the Giants talked about this year, their coach was finish; finish a game, fight all 4 quarters to the very end. So finish is a great thing we believe in Church & Dwight, and we had a great finish. 
 Q4 results were outstanding: 23% adjusted EPS growth, 7% organic revenue growth. Let me say it again, 7% organic revenue growth. We exited the year with great momentum. All the 4 corners, our organic revenue growth went from basically 1% to 3% to 5% to 7%. And something that's really monumental to me, ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent became the #2 selling laundry detergent in America on a dollar basis. We passed all, we passed Gain. 
 So big news for our company. I'll talk more about that in a minute. Number two, the great fourth quarter was the end to a terrific year. We had very strong total 2011 results: 12% adjusted EPS growth, 4% organic revenue growth, strong free cash flow, 112% of net income and 35% total shareholder return. 
 Kind of funny, one of your cohorts today kind of said to me, "Geez, your dividend yield's only up about 1.5%." Well, we did double last year to get the 2% and then, we had that unfortunate problem. Our stock ran  about 30%. So we're sorry about that. For all of you who have a hold or a sell in the company, you had a bad year. 
 Anyway, looking forward, we expect a very continued tough business environment in 2012. And to explain [ph] what I think you read in the papers, that's not our opinion. We expect continued weak consumer spending, continued volatility in commodities, continued competitive pressures and continued struggle for retailers. So it's a tough environment ahead, as we've faced the last year or 2. 
 As far as 2012 targets, we have set aggressive, but we think are achievable targets. We're calling 3% to 4% organic revenue growth, 25 to 50 basis points of gross margin improvement. We've been slightly down the last 2 years, and we're going to tell you why we think we can get that engine growing again and a 9% to 10% adjusted EPS growth. Last but not least, we're going to leverage our great cash machine. We're going to generate $1 billion in free cash flow over the next 3 years. 
 On top of doubling our dividend last year, we're raising it another 41% this year to get to a 2% yield. We're also seeing that great cash flow to build a new plant on California, which will open up and start full speed in the second quarter of this year. And we are continuing, I want to emphasize, to aggressively pursue good acquisitions. Do not misread the dividend increase as we're no longer an aggressive company and looking for acquisitions. We are looking for acquisitions as hard as ever before, and I'll talk about that more in a few minutes.
 So again, in summary, excellent Q4, great year, but continued tough environment ahead. We've set what we think are very aggressive, but achievable targets. I think some of the most aggressive targets in our industry coming off a good year. Those who have set -- 1 company I know has set similar targets coming off a bad year. We're going to continue leveraging our great cash machine. 
 So you think, how does Church & Dwight do it? If you've been investing with us for the past now 11 years, you love us. If you haven't, get on board. These are the numbers of how we've done versus the S&P 500. If I showed you the chart, which we have, of us versus our competitors, we are #1 in every one of these time frames as far as total shareholder return. 
 And how we do it is we have top 10 TSR drivers. These are not new. I've been telling you these for several years. It's the same 10. Just briefly, recession-resistant product portfolio; we know how to build power brands; we know how to ferociously defend our brands when we're attacked; we know how to drive international growth, great record there. We know how to expand gross margins, went a little backwards a year or 2, but I'll show you some charts over the last 5 years, and nobody has come close to us. We've got a superior overhead management system to keep our overheads down, the best in class in the industry; we've got an expert management team, something very unique about Church & Dwight. We keep our top people in the same jobs forever. And that pays off in tough times, and it pays off without making mistakes in our businesses. We've got a great proven track record in acquisitions. We're best in class for free cash flow conversion, and bottom line, you add all that up, we're all about being total shareholder return junkies. 
 Now today, I'm only going to talk about the #1 one, because in a few weeks most of you will probably be down to CAGNY, and at CAGNY, I'm going to talk about all 10. But #1 is the most important one right now, as far as any new news. I want to show you some fascinating things going down there. 
 So let's talk about our recession-resistant product portfolio. As you know or if you don't know, our portfolio is the most unique in the consumer packages industry. 60% of our portfolio is premium, like most of your other players. But unlike most of them, 40% of our portfolio are value brands. 
 And our value brands thrive in a recession economy. You've heard me say before, I'm probably the only CEO in this industry who wishes this recession would last another decade or 2 because it plays to our favor. And you might say, if you don't know it, "How value-oriented are your brands?" Well, here's our biggest category, liquid laundry detergent, $6 billion category. And if you index Tide and the other players, Tide is 100. You can see that our brands are roughly 1/2 to roughly 1/3 of the price of Tide. 
 The recession has just been wonderful for us. It's accelerated the shift from premium mid-tier brands to value brands. Look at that growth as the households are shifting into the value segment. The value tier is the only growth tier and has now passed, big news. We've now passed the mid-priced tier to become the #2 priced tier, with 28.5% of the dollar value in this category.
 Bigger than that, when it comes down to what do people actually do in wash loads at home, more U.S. households buy a value detergent than premium or mid-tier products. So we are truly the #1 most used category by households. 
 Not everybody knows the great Procter & Gamble leads the premium mid-tier segment, with a 70% share. But Church & Dwight is the clear leader in the value segment, with a 46% share. In fact, we've gained 7-points since 2007, and we're now 68% bigger than the #2 player. Church & Dwight is the only liquid laundry detergent manufacturer reporting significant share growth since 2007. We're up 4 points in that category. In fact, in 2011, the latest year, we grew more share than any other manufacturer, up 1.5 points.
 Big chart here. Church & Dwight is now second only to Procter & Gamble total wash loads. I love this chart again. You can talk units. You can talk dollars. At the end of the day, what's actually go into a washing machine out there, you can see Church & Dwight is 22.5% of all wash loads out there, having passed Sun Products and coming up the tail of Procter & Gamble. So it's a big jump since 2007. 
 But Matt, get up here. I'll be back in a little while to give a little more color on our 2012 outlook. But let me -- Matt, get up here. He'll take you through 2011. 
Matthew Farrell: Okay. Thanks, Jim. As you saw on the release, we had a terrific fourth quarter to the 5.4% volume and the difference of course is price mix, 1.7%. Gross margin was down 120 basis points. But if you paid attention to the release, you saw we had a tremendous quarter on household. And household, of course, has lower gross margins than personal care, and obviously, affected our operating margin as well. And EPS is up 23%, and I'll say a little bit about cash flow on a full year basis in a minute. 
 Here are the numbers, if you want to run your eyes down the page, but you see the reported net sales were up 11.3%. We had a number of adjustments, as we described in the release, related to a change in accounting period for international and the effect of the early customer orders as result of implementing SAP in Jan 1, some customers ordered early. But strip all that out, and that's how we got the 7% organic growth versus the 11% reported. 
 So here are the full year numbers. As everyone knows, we have an evergreen target of 3% to 4% organic growth, and once again, we were able to achieve that this year, 4.1% organic. Gross margin was down 50 basis points. If you were here last year, you probably know we were crawling up 50 to 100 basis points, but didn't happen for us this year largely because of commodities and also, because of mix, because household not only had a big fourth quarter, it also had a big year for us. 
 If you run your eyes down the page, you can see free cash flow, down 4%. I'm going to hit that in a minute. Again, here are the numbers on a reported basis: net sales, up 6%; organic, up 4%.
 So here's the history. You can see, it's where Jim talked about, we've had double-digit EPS growth 10 years in a row, and now this is the 11th. So we're 11 for '11, with 12% EPS up in 2011. And here's the history. So when you hear us talk about 3% to 4% organic growth, here's how it's been the last few years. So you see, 7%, 5%, 3% in 2010 and now 4% in 2011. So very consistent deliveries of organic growth. 
 Here's how the quarters looked this past year. So we accelerated your organic growth year-over-year 1%, 3%, 5% and then 7% in the fourth quarter. Now obviously, what this means is we're going to have very easy comps in 2012 in the first and second quarter and wicked comps in the second half of 2012. But I'm sure we'll talk about that more in the Q&A. 
 Here's how price looked on a full year basis. So remember that 4% we talked about for organic, and that's largely all volume on a full year basis. And on this slide, so we got prices in the Specialty business, and you may recall at the Specialty business, we're essentially just passing through cost increases to our customers. That's what's driving the 7%. 
 Here's gross margin history as well. We had a huge up in 2009, over 400 basis points, to get us to 44.8%. 2010, we lost 10 basis points. In this past year, we lost 50. But we're pretty proud of our record in hanging on to such high gross margins in spite of significant commodity cost increases over this period of time. 
 And here's how it shook out this past year. So we were able to offset the commodities, the 200 basis points of hurt, with cost savings but really the mix is what drove us down to a negative 50.  
 And here's the marketing history as well. So you remember in 2009 where we -- our gross margins expanded more than 400 basis points. Well, that's the same year we took up our marketing 190 basis points, and right in the teeth of the sort of the recession. 
 Over the past year from 2010 to 2012, you can see we shaved it by 20 basis points. It's pretty obvious that it had no effect on our organic growth rate, considering the fact that we came in at over 4% on a full year basis. So marketing is relative, and one of the metrics we spend a lot of time looking at is share of voice versus share of market.
 Here's how we ended the year. We tracked our 8 power brands and look at how well we're growing our shares. As you can see in this case, we've maintained or grew share on the 5 of our 8 power brands. And here's free cash flow. So free cash flow once again, as Jim pointed out, if you look along the bottom of this slide, you can see that we've had free cash flow conversion in excess of 100%. 
 Once again, $361 million, as compared to $375 million the prior year. Something to keep in mind here is that we had $9 million more higher CapEx in 2012 than 2000 -- pardon me, 2011 versus 2010, and we also had a swing, about $30 million hurt year-over-year in components of working capital.
 Here's, as far as the days ago, our cash conversion cycle is pretty solid, under 30 days, which really the timing of a lot of the purchases of inventory and receivables and payables that created that increase in year-over-year working capital.  
 Okay here's that minimum capital investment, this is something we track very carefully as well. So typically, we bang around between 2% and 2.5%, that's CapEx as a percentage of sales. You can see this past year, we're at $73 million. I'm sure one of the questions on people's minds is what are we going to be calling for next year. Next year is going to be $70 million to $75 million, and a big chunk of that, about $24 million of that, has to do with this West Coast plant that we'll be completing early this year. 
 And here's the balance sheet. As many of you know, we've been pretty much unlevered since the fourth quarter of 2010. We're leveraged 0.5 total-debt-to-EBITDA. We're BBB rated, and we have lots of dry powder. So lots of cash on hand and lots of availability of our credit lines. And we're very deliberate about the destination for cash flow at Church & Dwight. 
 So we'd spend a lot of time thinking about this slide. So TSR is #1 for us. As Jim said, we have a lot of capability here. We haven't bought anything large in a couple of years, but we're very fussy. And that's not going to change. If you run your eyes down the page, you'll see new products would be #2 and then CapEx for organic growth and our G2G program, which is good to great. Return of cash to shareholders, so that, of course, is dividends, which you saw this morning, we increased. I'm going to say a little bit more about that in a second. 
 We also bought back $80 million worth of stock late in the year, November, December. Didn't have much of an effect on the 2011 versus '10 numbers. But I guess it starts us off at a lower number going into 2012, and our expectations, we'll at least spend as much on share buybacks in '12 as we did in '11 and likely more, and we certainly have the cash to do it.
 And this is just to give you a graphic with respect to the dividend. So we took the dividend up this morning, 41%, and you probably know we would've taken it up 12% anyway, because we always increase the dividend commensurate with the prior year's EPS increase, which was 12%. So we took it up a little bit higher, so now we're at a 40% payout, which we think is a comfortable payout for us. We also think the dividend yield of 2.1% is a meaningful dividend to investors. We're not going to chase it. So the 40% payout right now is more of a principle that we're going to be following. 
 And I'm going to turn it right back over to Jim right now. 
James Craigie: .
 Thanks, Matt. Truly awesome numbers, very proud to look at those myself again and again. 2012, what do we saw for much of the business? As I said before, we think it's going to stay very tough. We expect commodity costs to stay high up in the second -- but you'd have 3 questions: Will commodity costs get worse or better? Will competitive price wars continue wherein? And will consumer spending improve or get worse? Attitude is, I have to say, pretty dismal on this. We don't expect consumer spending to get better, we expect it to stay weak. We expect commodity costs to stay high. We expect continued price wars out there. So as we always -- we have motto in-house, we plan for the worse but we hope for better. 
 Let me talk about 6 key points on 2012, which are our strategic outlook on the business. First of all, the new product pipeline. On the table here in the center of the room is our new product pipeline. I think it's the best, and I'll say it again, the best new product pipeline we've ever had in the company. 
 Let me take a few -- through a few of the key ones. ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, we had a very good success from 2011, bringing out a skin-sensitive version, our best ever in that. 2012, you all know, is going to be the year of the unit dose. We're the first ones in the market with it. The products are all there on the table. 
 All of our competitors are launching their products. Over the next few months, you're going to see what happens in the industry. I think, it's going to be a very interesting situation as to how much of the marketplace unit dose becomes, how it shapes out and everything. But 2012 will be the year of the unit dose product from all competitors, and we have a great product over there. 
 Cat litter. DOUBLE DUTY was the most successful new cat litter in the past 5 years in the cat litter industry. In 2012, everybody else is catching up DOUBLE DUTY. We're launching a great new product called Ultra Last, which gives you longer-lasting odor protection for that. So everybody keeps catching up to us. We're staying a step ahead, and the new product is just terrific. 
 Toothpaste, now I will admit, we've been a little delinquent on toothpaste, as Procter, Colgate and Glaxo have been very aggressive out there with new toothpaste. Well, finally, I think, we've hit a home run. We're taking 2 of our power brands and putting them together: the great ARM & HAMMER toothpaste brand and Orajel, which is #1 brand in tooth sensitivity, to come out with a new sensitive toothpaste. This is just launching. This is brand-new news. I will tell you, this is my -- I think, I'm not -- I'm parochial, I know. I'm Chairman of Church Dwight, but I think this is the best new toothpaste in the marketplace. So there are samples over there. You'll see us showing up in your store shortly, but I think it's a fantastic new sensitive toothpaste. 
 Nair. If you go in spas these days, Brazilian spa clay is very hot. And so we're taking this great new idea and bringing it out for the retail markets, and I think it will be a great new addition to the Nair line.
 Trojan. Interesting new product, Trojan Charged. Intensified experience from beginning to end with heating, cooling and tingling. And there's some interesting ingredients there. So if you want to charge up your sex life, get Trojan Charged, an example there.
 Now something a little bit new for us. We're ending 3 with that term. I know you'll love it. They call it white space categories. Those are new categories for us. I know they're not white space categories for some of our competitors, but they are white space categories. We're entering the manual toothbrush business, which is an $800 million category. We're adding dishwashing additive, about $140 million category, and we're entering -- continuing to enter the vibrations category. Let me tell you about the products. 
 First of all, ARM & HAMMER Tooth Tunes. I know we launched this last year. We had a little technical problem, so we held it back. I truly think this is the biggest thing in manual toothbrush since they put bristles on a plastic stick. This is proprietary technology that delivers music while your brush. The actual -- You can't hear it if you hold it outside your mouth. It actually goes through your jawbone up to your ear. Plays 2 minutes, so get your kids to brush their teeth for 2 minutes. We've got some very hot artists from Black Eyed Peas to Queen to Selena Gomez. So a hot new product we'll be launching into the marketplace, and I really think it's the biggest thing in manual toothbrush in a long time. 
 OxiClean dishwasher booster. You may not know this, but a year or so ago, all the guys at dishwashing liquids were told to get the phosphates out of their product by the government. Phosphates can be bad things, they pollute the waterways, and they had to take phosphates out of all their great brands. As a result, their products can't clean as well or certainly get the spots off of glasses in that. 
 So it was a great chance for us. We had OxiClean, the #1 product in laundry additive. Let's bring that into dishwashing additives. So right in front of me on the table right here, is a great new product, a booster product, you put in with your detergent to get cleaner, spotless glasses out there. So a great new way of staying [ph] the OxiClean brand. 
 Trojan Midnight Collection. You know we've started in the category, we launched full-priced vibrators last year. This year, we're taking those products into the largest vibration channel, which is the adult class of trade. So if any of you'd like to go out on store checks with me, sign up. It will be lots of fun this year.
 Distribution. Great products are nice, but if you don't get distribution, your fighting upstream on this one. This is the chart we've shown in the past. If you index where we sit in 2005 in this categories, I won't give you specific numbers because that would be of great insights for my competitors, but then index where we are today, in 2011, last year. You can see we've made great strides. And I'll just tell you right now based on what we know about 2012, we have grown distribution in almost every one of these power categories. So we have a great insight in 2012, and our distribution base is growing, driven largely by these great new products. 
 Marketing spending. We have increased marketing spending by over 50% since 2001 to 2011. We did have a great breakout year on 2009, where we just had so much growth in gross margin, we investment spent. And since then, we've held around 13%. Now 2 perspectives on this thing. 13% in 2011 or 12.9%, that's more than any of our competitors out there. And it's a bigger change since 2007 than any of our competitors.
 But I'm going to show you now something for the first time, we've never revealed. Because some of you may say, "Well, 12.9, 11.3, 10.9, not a big deal." Well here's some new news for you. If you break up that 12.9%, actually, domestically, we've spent 13.9%. Break it up. On the premium side, we actually spend 20% of net revenue on marketing. On the value side, we only spend 5%, so remember that. If you go back to this chart now, imagine putting Church & Dwight compared to our competitors there, who are almost all premium products, we're really at 20%. They're at 11%, 10%, whatever. 
 So we are significantly advantaged to most of them on the premium side of the category and growing. So that's new news, folks. We've never revealed that little insight to you before about Church & Dwight. But it's a big factor of why we've been able to grow our businesses. And as you can see from this chart, by spending than our competitors, our share of voice to share of markets have exceeded 100%, 19 out of 21 times since 2009, a key reason why we've been able to grow our shares quite steadily. 
 Improved gross margin. Gross margin, our goal is to grow 25 to 50 basis points. We've been struggling  with this one the last 2 years after having an enormous jump in 2009. But I will show to you that we delivered more growth over the last 2 years. While our gross has not increased the past 2 years, we've had greater gross margin growth than anybody else over the past 4 years. Nobody's even close. We've been up 510 basis points. Next closest is the great Reckitt company, over 120.  
 So we've had [ph] progress, but we're going to get it back. We're going to get the mojo back in gross margin. The 4 key drivers of that have always been the 4 key drivers, but we've stepped on the gas even harder.  What we call our good [ph] rate cost optimization program, reformulating, reducing packaging, reducing SKUs harder than ever. 
 Supply chain restructuring. We are starting up a new plant in California second quarter this year. Acquisition synergies. If we do make a major acquisition, we'll certainly drive a lot of synergies there to help our margins by buying higher-margin businesses and taking the cost out.
 And price mix. We are launching all the new products I talked to you about. Certainly, the personal care side are all high margin. All those white space 3 categories are all high margin for us. So we love those. 
 If you look at gross margin next year, I said to you, cost savings, we've really sort of stepping on the pedal, offset some of the raw materials, and price mix in total will be kind of neutral for us. So net, we believe we can get 25 to 50 basis points of gross margin.
 Building cash position. We are just a cash machine, folks. We are just doing math. When I first came to this company, back in 2004, I think, we were generating $150 million of cash flow a year. Now we're well over $300 million a year, and $1 billion over 3 years. So we've got cash coming out of our ears right now. 
 Acquisitions, again. We've had a great history on this over time. It's been a great builder of our company. We know how to do acquisitions. We know how to drive synergies. We know how to make them accretive to the company. We have mapped it before. We're very disciplined and very tight on this thing. We will not do an acquisition unless they meeting these guidelines. It has to be a #1 or #2 share brand. It has to have higher growth, higher margin. We want asset light. 
 We don't want to pick up headquarters and plants from them. We want to leverage our capital base and manufacture this [ph] in purchasing by taking those business and putting them with the backs of our business, and we want to deliver sustainable competitive advantage, taking brands we think we can continue to build. 
 We've made a couple of little bolt-on acquisitions last 2 years. They were terrific. Simply Saline, the #1 brand in the nasal hygiene, a great growth category as people are looking for more and more natural solutions, instead of drugs, to put in kids' noses and adults' noses to take care of their colds and allergies. Feline Pine was a nice bolt-on to our cat litter businesses. It's the #1 natural cat litter out there. 
 And BATISTE, kind of a funny one for us. It's a U.K. product, mostly. It's dry shampoo, interesting product, very hot over there. It is the #1 driver of the shampoo business in the U.K. This one's on fire. We can barely keep up with demand on this product, and it's just been terrific. And we love it and may even have some future growth potential outside of the U.K. on this one. 
 Matt told you, we've got tons of firepower. Even though we took our dividend up 40%, even though we're buying back stock, we've got tons and tons of cash. So there's nothing beyond our reach in terms of the kind of acquisitions we will make. We could easily make a $1 billion acquisition, but it'd have to fit our criteria, and we're very stingy about that. 
 So let me wrap it up in terms of the 2012 business targets. As Matt said to you, we're calling 3% to 4%, that's our evergreen target. We've always, at least, met that. Gross margin expansion, we've been sliding a little sideways in the last 2 years. We are adamant about trying to make this goal in 2012.
 We believe gross margin is the gas to the engine. We need to get gross margin growing again, and we have an all-out effort to get it growing again, get it back to at least the 2010 levels. 
 Marketing spending, as I told you, we're keeping it relatively flat. But I showed you the secret sauce on that today. 12.7% really isn't 12.7% on our premium brands, it's more like 20% of our premium brands. So we have almost twice the spending power of our competitive brands in those categories. And if price wars break out of that, we could afford to shave that a little bit, if we had to, over the course of the year and still be way above our competitors from a marketing spending. 
 Adjusted EPS growth, 9% to 10%. We're shooting for our 12th straight year of at least 10% growth, and we're calling 9% to 10% in total. But again, most of our competitors, you know where they are. We've seen them down in the low- to mid-single digits range in that. So we're looking for another very good year, top of the pack within the CPG industry.
 And so wrapping up the results, 5 of the targets, including the dividend getting back up to 2.1% yield. So again, we want to do another 10% year. If you haven't been on board of the Church & Dwight train, get on it. We're 11 for '11 right now. We're going for 12 for '12, and we plan on delivering that target. 
 So let me open the floor now, and Matt, join me up here. Any questions you may have about what we've told you? 
James Craigie: Bill? 
William Chappell: I guess, going back to the gross margin, 2 questions. One, I'm a little surprised that you kind of said that price mix would be flat just because I've heard P&G talk about maybe raising prices again or altering prices in the detergent category. Also, it seem like with your growth, the mix would continue to be a drag on gross margin indefinitely. So maybe you could talk about that. And then also, a few years ago, there was a goal of 50% gross margin. Is that really out of the question kind of in today's landscape? Or do you need an acquisition to get there? How should we look at that long-term? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes, Bill, as far as the 50% long-term target, that's still in the cards for us. And there's lots of ways to get there. Obviously, organic is a piece, but acquisitions is also an important piece. I would say for the last 2 years, we've had a detour on that, but that's largely because, if you look at the schedules of the release, that household really has been growing tremendously, double-digit growth in 2011. And if you look at how 2012 is starting out, it's only the first quarter. First quarter is starting to look like a replay of Q4 2011. So again, so we have a little bit of a detour with respect to the gross margin, but not with respect to profits. 
James Craigie: Plus all these new product are gross margin accretive, so we're already feeling good about it. 
Matthew Farrell: Right. So we don't have an infatuation with just the gross margin percentage. As Jim said, it's one of -- it's very important to the company. We have 4 metrics, it's 1 of the 4. We got a donut on that one this past year, so it's very motivating for next year. So I think it is the secret sauce for the company, and it's probably not going to go away. As far as gross margin goes for next year, many of you know we entered 2011 with almost 50% of our most volatile commodities hedged. Going into 2012, we have almost 60% hedged. Now the hedges that we had in place going into '11 actually provided us a fair amount of benefit to gross margin this past year. Now remember they roll off. So obviously, we are going to have little bit of a bigger hurdle year-over-year '11 going to '12 in covering commodity cost. So that is baked in to our numbers of 20 to 25 to 50 basis points up. The other thing, too, is PODs. PODs are being made outhouse right now, a third party co-packer. So until we get them in-house that's going to be a bit of a drag for us as well on margins on the first half of the year. But mix is really is the wildcard for 2012. 
James Craigie: Alice? 
Alice  Longley: My question is about the weighting of the quarters. From what you're saying, it sounds as though organic sales might be exceptionally strong and decelerating in the first quarter than decelerating through the year. But that gross margins might go in the other direction, maybe being down still at the beginning and then up to the year. Is that -- could you tell us about the quarterly weighting? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes. So if you go back to the slide that we had. 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% is organic. So we're going to have an easy comp in the first quarter. So you're right, organic is going to be skewed towards the first half of the year versus the second half, and gross margins is -- given how we're starting out, Q1 looks like Q4. So we expect to be down in the first quarter in gross margin year-over-year. As far as how the EPS works for the year, this past year, we were slightly skewed to the first half of the year. It was 52%, 48%. And for 2012, it looks more like 49% 51%, if that helps you. 
Alice  Longley: I guess, I'm still confused about why gross margins are going up, given there's all kinds of reasons to be concerned about it. You're not getting any pricing. The gross -- the hedging has worn off. What makes growth -- and you say the California plant doesn't really help until 2013. Or is that wrong? 
Matthew Farrell: So I don't know if everybody is aware of this, but we have our California plant that's going to be coming online midyear. We're going to turn it on around March, April, but it won't really ramp up full board until, say, at late June or early July. This plant is 1/3 the size of our plant in York, Pennsylvania, so consequently not nearly the same contribution that you would have from a plant the size of York. And we do have charges this year with respect to severance and write-off of assets because we're moving operations for cat litter from Green River, Wyoming out to Victorville. As far as commodities, your question is 25 to 50 basis points is aggressive for 2012. Well, number one, you wouldn't be aware of what hedges we have in place; number two, our Good to Great program is something that's alive and well. And that is, if you look at these slides we've put up for each of the last few years and you look at commodities and you see savings, savings comes from the efforts that are in the plants largely to reduce our cost per unit, and we have a lot of efforts going on right now in our personal care plants in Lakewood and also, in Folkestone in the U.K. 
James Craigie: You're right, gross margin is going to be our toughest thing to turn around because it's a turnaround for us in the last 2 years. I would tell you two different terms -- in terms of all the projects we have going on, we have 2 relatively new things in this industry we're doing. One, we're combining our purchasing power with noncompeting companies across various commodities. Where we feel we've done a great job of maxing our purchasing power based on $2.7 billion of revenues. We're talking to other companies on common ingredients and trying to boost purchasing power, and that's off to a good start. It takes some time to put those kind of agreements together, but we're doing that. Secondly, we're continuing a project we call project simplification, which is ripping apart all of our various businesses into how many SKUs, how many pack sizes, how many formulas, how many different ingredients in that, and trying to simplify that to save money across different categories. So it's a tough one, but we are committed. We have the projects, and the organization is committed. As Matt said earlier, it's 25% of our bonuses. We got a goose egg on that one on this past year as far as bonus payout. So I got a very motivated organization to take all those efforts of cost savings, project simplification, combining purchasing power and everything to get the gross margin growing again. We must make that happen for our future success. And I think we have the right amount of programs and focus on the company to go do it. 
Matthew Farrell: And Alice, just a follow-up to your question, because somebody's probably going to ask this, is we had the SAP implementation on January 1. So consequently, there were some sales -- customers ordered early in anticipation of Jan 1, just to make sure they were protected. That would create additional sales and profits in the fourth quarter, which we spent back in marketing. So it didn't help our EPS in Q4, but it is out of Q1. So it's probably a couple of cents. It's one reason why we would say we're probably going to be $0.01 to $0.02 below consensus for Q1. 
James Craigie: I just want to say, too,  that SAP startup was a major startup. We went on Canada, October 1. We did the U.S. in January 2 or 3. I've been involved with SAP startups in the past that have almost brought a company to its knees. That project, I won't use the word flawless, but it was remarkable. We didn't miss one order. Everything was on-time, and my organization, particularly the operations and finance, they did a spectacular job. We've had people working 7 days a week, 15, 20 hours a day since October, November of last year. They would -- I hate to say it, but we only gave them Christmas Day off. They were back at work, and they did an absolutely phenomenal job. And we haven't had one customer complaint about a misorder. And I think, in the past, I know companies like Hershey at one point in time, Fruit of the Loom, other companies have been brought to their knees, by an SAP startup in that. So kudos to my organization for making a major change. That new system will help us a lot in the future as far as better insights and data, better management of our working capital and everything else. So kudos to my Church & Dwight team, and one thing I'm proud of Mark Conish [ph] at the back of the room there, Head of the Operations Group, came to me about the middle of January and said to me, "Jim, do you know what's most remarkable about this?" It's not that we've been -- done a great start-up. He said, "Not 1 person complained about working so hard."  And that's the Church & Dwight way. And I had, I don't know, 50, 100 people working on this almost full-time. It was absolutely spectacular. So I've just got to brag for my corporation. SAP startups have brought a lot of companies to their knees, and again, we didn't miss one order. Mr. Schmitz? 
William Schmitz: Well, you're feeling fairly charitable about this disclosure. Now we know that 20% of your ad spending is in personal care. Can you break down the gross margin differential between the personal care side of the U.S. business and the household side, and then maybe how much that's impacting the total company gross margin? 
James Craigie: No. 
William Schmitz: I mean, close? I mean... 
Matthew Farrell: Nice try, Bill. We're not going to go into that kind of detail. I mean, mostly we're walking around numbers, you'd say, that household are going to be lower than personal care. So it's probably 20 basis points -- actually 20%, 2,000 basis point difference between average personal care and average household. 
William Schmitz: Okay. Now along those lines, I mean, what do you think is driving the softness of the personal care business? I mean, how much of it is cyclical? And what do you have to do to kind of move the categories again? 
Matthew Farrell: I think, Bill, it's largely recession. I really just think the personal care products -- actually, the ones that are, I hate to say, more necessary in life. The toothpaste categories have been relatively strong, and it's been positive. Other categories, I think, people are just using less or not using at all, and it's more discretionary. I mean, you got to wash your clothes, your cat needs cat litter, you need cleaning products for the house. But I hate to say it, you don't have to use as much underarm deodorant or you kind of chintz on some of the personal care stuff, and they're expensive. So I think people just cut back in this recessionary time. So I think it's just largely a recession impact. We're seeing that across the board of most of our competitors in that. So I think it's recession. 
William Schmitz: And then, just lastly, just maybe some more details on the laundry pricing environment. I know a couple of your value competitors are being pretty aggressive later in the year. I mean, do you think that's going to normalize over time? And then maybe P&G in powder, which talked about a price rollback there. 
James Craigie: I would just say the category has been relatively stabilized and our terms in terms of promotion spending in that. Actually, we saw a little less spending on our part in Q4 on trade spending and that. But it's -- you know the history of this one. There was kind of a price war kicked off by Procter in 2010. They were a winner that year. We were a winner that year also, in terms of share growth. But the guys who lost, guys like Henkel or Purex came back with a vengeance in 2011 and continued the war. That was even more pertinent to us because they're value competitors. And we had to be competitive with them in our price gaps. So we had another great year. They came back a little bit, and guys like Procter lost some. So laundry detergent is one of the most aggressive categories in terms of straight spending, so you've got to keep your price gaps. You've got to be up there with your merchandising. My team does an awesome job with that as far as managing price points, pack sizes everything else like that. And we have a good -- great pipeline of new products, so we expected that category to stay aggressive. We'll see what POD does. I think it's a very fascinating product. All the competitors have it now. You'll be seeing it hitting the shelves. We were out there first. Everybody else will have their products out there, I think, in the next 30 to 60 days. We'll see how the retailers set it. Do they put them all together? Do they break them up by brands? We'll see whether it's co-merchandised, or separately merchandised. You'll see the incentives of all the manufacturer offerings. It's going to be quite an interesting game in 2012. And again, it's a higher-margin product, long term, for everybody. So if it wins, it wins. But it's also kind of interesting in launching the highest-priced laundry detergent in the face of a recession. So I look forward to a Harvard Business School case being written on this in 2 or 3 years from now to see what it does. We all know that PODs have been tried or unit dose has been tried many times in the United States on laundry detergent, without success. But times are different, things are different, new products. We'll see. We're very happy with the products we have out there. We're putting them out there, maintaining the price gaps we have on the liquid side, and we'll see what happens. 
Unknown Analyst: [indiscernible] 
James Craigie: Who, Procter? Talk to Procter. 
Unknown Analyst: [indiscernible] 
James Craigie: So probably what? 
Unknown Analyst: [indiscernible] 
James Craigie: Good for them. We like -- our powder business is doing just fine. Jason? I'm sorry. 
Unknown Analyst: Just a quick question about that advertising split. So the 20% of sales spent on the premium part of the portfolio, a lot of what's in there is also on personal care and is also the power brands where shares are actually down, so not just that categories are weak, but shares are down. So can you just talk a little bit about that? I mean, it seems like a disproportionate amount of spending was not the same kind of return that you get on the value portion of the portfolio. 
James Craigie: I see what you're saying, but really there's not a linkage there. Three of the brands were down. Trojan was one, we're off a couple of tenths, not something big. And we've been -- overall, sales are fine. Profits are fine. Gross margins were up in that category for us, so it's just awful hard to grow share when you're a 75-plus share. The one brand that had a little trouble was Orajel. Private label's been very aggressive in that category. We're dealing with that but we're keeping our spending power up on that side. And the third one was... 
Matthew Farrell: Nair. 
James Craigie: Nair. Nair was kind of a weird one this past year. Procter entered the depilatory category with a very high-priced lip hair removal product, I mean, way up high. Good for them, it seems to be very successful. But we did the appropriate thing, we built that into the category. We changed the whole category dynamics. If the category, if they didn't enter the category, we would've had a bright green light on Nair. We had an awesome year on Nair, and we were up on sales and everything was going well there. But as we adjust the category to take Procter into effect, we had to go to a yellow. The other one is Spinbrush. Spinbrush was down a little bit. There was a lot of competitive spending in there by other guys. We're dealing within that. But we got the launch of Tooth Tunes this year, that we're very happy with. So we're going to keep our spending up high. So don't -- different factors were going on in that, and we feel we have the spending power. It was mostly a private label issue, more of a pricing issue was going on there that we're going to deal with. We're not going to necessarily pullback our spending to do that in those categories. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And I would never want to suggest that it's a good idea to pull back on marketing spending. That's, like, not something all of us are allowed to think. But it does seem like 20% of sales is a really high number on businesses that are -- this side of the category are just so challenged right now. So I mean, do you think that the categories reaccelerate to be more attractive categories? Is there anything that you think you guys can do to just stimulate category growth in a different way with that kind of money going after it? 
James Craigie: Yes. We hope the new product pipeline will do that. We have some of the best new products ever in those categories. We're going to keep the spending up high. We think we're dealing with price point issues out there, but it's a new news category, a premium categories. And we're going to put this -- we're going to keep the spending power up there, and I think with this new product pipeline that we have, we will stimulate product category growth. Again, it's a recession. We're flooding a massive tidal wave of these recession-hit categories in that, but we're not going to give up. And I'm just -- I'll say it 100 times. I'm very happy about the new product pipeline, and I think, with the advertising spending behind that, we should see some terrific results. 
Unknown Analyst: Just following on that, though, you've got this awesome new product pipeline, and yet you're still only looking for 3% to 4% organic sales growth this year. And if I'm not mistaken, 2012, the 9% to 10% EPS range is lower than you've seen over the last 10 years. I think it's the first time you will, maybe, put up high-single digit earnings growth. So as you think out -- not about 2012, but as 2013, 2014, as you think about your capital spending plan and what you see kind of for a 5-year long-term growth rate, do you think 9 to 10 is the new range and 3 to 4 is the new range on the top line? Or do you think it gets better? 
James Craigie: That's a very good question. I think part of it depends on the economy. This run of recessionary time is going to be tough. Part of it depends on competition. I mean, we are, honestly, quite surprised to see some of the calls by some of our major competitors in low-single digits. That makes us think -- and they've talk about increasing marketing spending at some case. Well, they're going to accept low-single digits and try to increase marketing spending. We're going to deal with that. It may be a little out of line to call 12% to 15% earnings growth when they're investing in marketing and coming back to get their share back and sacrificing EPS. So I think those are the 2 biggest factors. We just see a continued tough time in the economy for any kind of premium products out there, and we see competitors doing things we're a little wary of, that they may be trying to get their shares back at the expense of earnings that we can't be blind to that. We've got to be able to defend against that and grow our business. So I hope long term, the economy gets better. I hope long term our competitors won't be a little more profit-oriented. We'll see. So right now, I think -- there's only one company I know in the industry who's calling better than that, and they're coming off of pretty down year. So we're the only guys off a good year promising another double-digit year. 
Unknown Analyst: Absolutely. But does it make you think differently or more aggressively about the international opportunity for acquisitions? I mean, BATISTE sounds like it's a one-off, being a U.K. business. But if you assume maybe that the mature markets really are going to be dead in the water for quite some time, potentially, do you say, "Wow, we need to be a little bit more aggressive about Latin America or other emerging markets?" 
James Craigie: We're not -- we're absolutely aggressive. I think we spend more time working acquisitions this year than any year I've been involved in the company, this past year. Just nothing came in that would fit our criteria. We don't feel we missed anything that got bought by somebody else. I can't go into some of the things we've looked at, might surprise you, we were looking at that we were -- to fit our criteria, other categories. As far as international, I'll take it as  international versus domestic, I don't care where it is that fits the criteria. As with BATISTE, I mean, you know my history, I've kind of always poo-pooed the hair category. I never really loved it, but it was too competitive in that. And we found this one little niche brand over that, that's just rocking the market in the U.K. we couldn't resist it. I'm glad we didn't because it's off to a fantastic start for us. It has also built our U.K. business by 25%, giving us more scale in that country. So no, we'll look anywhere in the world. I will tell you the emerging markets, there's going to be a case study written on that one very shortly. The emerging markets have become extremely competitive. The acquisition prices are  sky high. And I think similar guys who put their toe in the water out to one of these markets and pay ridiculous prices. There are now price wars and everything else going on. I will tell you my heart I think there's good sense that you are focusing on the domestic market here and mining your gold at home. You can make a lot more money and get a lot more growth in the U.S. in terms of consumer spending them  for some of these foreign markets. That said, I'm not stupid. I know long term the growth is in the emerging markets. We are looking at it, and if we find the right opportunity, we'll take it. So we're just not going to say the next one has to be emerging markets because that's where the growth is. We'll take the next one if it is the right criteria, anywhere. 
Matthew Farrell: Something else that might be useful, when you think about the 9% to 10% call for 2012, is that, there's a 2% drag. Say, 1% or a little more than 1% is FX year-over-year. And the other is our JVs. So you may remember we had a press release we put out that were getting into air pollution game. We have a 3-way joint venture with TATA and FMC. So if you look on our JV line, that's a drag as well. So that 9% to 10% has got a couple of other things netted in there. So we think it's pretty strong call. 
James Craigie: Jason? 
Jason Gere: What was the contribution from innovation in 2011? And just trying to think about 2012, obviously, it seems your strongest and certainly, looking at the products, most interesting than we've seen in a few years. So I'm just trying to think about the success of innovation over the last few years, especially in an economic downturn versus still opportunity for distribution gains. And what type of share gains are you building into that 3 to 4? 
James Craigie: I would tell you, in general, new products have represented about 50% of our organic growth for the last couple of years. I haven't seen a final number in 2011 because the laundry business did quite well, but the sensitive skin part of that was a good contributor. So in general, we're looking for at least 50% of our organic growth as we've done the last couple of years from new products, which I think is pretty great, great number out there. So my group's chief genius over there, released new products for us now for quite a few years. I think I've got a fantastic new product team. Like other guys, these ideas are coming both in-house and out of house. We've signed some deals with companies with great new technology that are part of the products here, part of the things you'll see in the future. We haven't revealed yet. I'm very happy with -- when I came here in 2004, the new product pipeline was pretty poultry. Today, I think we have one of the best of the new product pipelines in the industry, and it's a key contributor to our great organic growth numbers. 
Jason Gere: Okay. And just a follow-up, what was the guidance at the beginning of 2011 that you set for the year in a pre-split basis? 
James Craigie: Guidance for what? 
Jason Gere: For 2011. What did you set the year at? What did you start the year at? 
James Craigie: EPS, you're talking? 
Jason Gere: Yes, EPS. 
Matthew Farrell: It would be 4 something. 
James Craigie: Maureen, how's your memory? 
Maureen Usifer: 12.35% for the year. 
James Craigie: EPS? 
Maureen Usifer: 10 to 11. [indiscernible] 
Unknown Analyst: I guess, the point is you're making these commentaries that you're planning for the worst. So the old Church & Dwight that we know usually provides conservative guidance. Why not try to spook anybody about a 9 number out there, if you look just based on how... 
James Craigie: Why don't we call for the -- we'll call it 10% to 11%, EPS. It came in at 12% 
Joe Lachky: Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo. Jim, I hope this is not a touchy subject or anything, but I guess given the recent disclosures, how would you gauge the board's support of you and your management team? And then just a follow up for Matt, was there any -- how much was the benefit to EPS from any sort of compensation accrual reversal in the fourth quarter? 
James Craigie: Let me just add, I think, the 8-K we issued speaks for itself. Other than that, we really can't comment any kind of litigation going on, and I think your comment about  EPS is -- it's less $0.005. If you'd like to give it back to me, I'll be glad to see you afterwards. Other questions? Bill? 
William Chappell: Just on cash usage, so you said we're kind of done for the dividend for this year. Trying to understand as we go through the year, 1 quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters and your building cash, would you step up share repurchase? I mean, you said $80 million is what you did last year. You'll do at least that much this year. Will that be front-end loaded? How should we look at use of cash versus earning 0.1%? 
Matthew Farrell: Yes, just so everybody's aware, we have a $300 million authorization with no endpoint. We bought back $80 million of shares late in 2011, and what I said earlier was that we would buy a minimum of $80 million in 2012 and to get the benefit of that, obviously, we need to be front-end loaded. And yes, we would go above that in 2012. I don't expect we would expect our authorization level, though, in 2012. 
William Chappell: And then just one follow-up on the PODs, since you're one of the first ones out, can you give us, -- I mean, 45 days in, kind of what you've seen on consumer acceptance? Has it been better or worse? How should we look at it? 
James Craigie: Bill, we don't have any consumer feedback data on it right now. The battle's really going to heat up over the next 90 days. We've been really guys out there in some accounts. We're now building distribution in all accounts. The competitors are launching their products in all accounts so I just -- I found it a fascinating thing, moving faster and watching what happens in this category, how much the category takes. I'm somewhat worried about the negative impact on overdosing on the liquid side because this is a quantity control versus people tend to use as much liquid. They tend to use more liquid than they're supposed to. This one giving a controlled dose, does it cannibalizes liquid? Does it reduce liquid? You've got -- liquid category even may have negative year because of this. We'll see. And it's a recession, the consumers want to buy something that's the most premium-priced laundry detergent ever for all of us on a per dose basis. So I fought Procter. I love innovation, and I love to fight in innovation story. I don't like to fight pricing wars. We're good at it, but the best thing to do for the whole industry is to bring in a lot of great innovation. And so I applaud them and us and all for following this. But innovation is great. There's a  whole table full in front of you here. Any data is better [ph] than fighting a price war, so we'll see. I think it's going to be fascinating what happens in the category, and I don't know all the competitors' plans yet for what they plan to spend on things like that. We don't know. The first interesting read is going to happen in the next, again, 90 days is how does the retailers set the shelves. I mean, how many products show up from every one of the suppliers? Are they put altogether into a POD section? Are they separately put next to the brands? Introductory trial programs, advertising spending, promotion spending, a lot of stuff's going to be -- the next time we see you, we'll have a lot more insights into what happens in the category. And it will be interesting. But I'd rather -- I like this way in laundry. I love to get out of price wars. I like to get innovation, will love that any day of the week. So it's a good direction. Yes, sir? 
Unknown Analyst: Jim, I guess, to what extent did the single-dose initiative hit P&L this quarter, if at all? I mean, are going to see that as you go through and as the sales come through next quarter? 
James Craigie: You mean as far as the pipes for PODs in December? 
Unknown Analyst: Or the upfront cost for that matter and from a capital perspective, too. 
James Craigie: The shipments weren't a whole lot. It's probably less than $1 million just for PODs. I think the 2 PODs and Ultra Last is probably, may have $2 million of sales. So not a whole lot because we got this going in December. So it wouldn't necessarily be a whole lot of delve. It may have little bit of sliding associated with that too, which would depress the margins in Q4. That's all in Q4. 
Unknown Analyst: And that's more of the question. I mean, from the cost side or just getting organization ramped up to have a decent amount of capacity ready to get out there, is that material at all? 
James Craigie: Well, we're developing that now so we're not in-house just yet. So we're actually going to be bringing it in-house. But yes, it will be a few million dollars of capital for sure. But it's not a double-digit number. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then, I guess, on acquisitions. I mean wish list is pretty long for what you want. As the organization has gotten stronger and obviously, a lot bigger, how realistic is it to think that you can fill a deal that's niche, that's margin-enhancing, that's a low capital requirements, that's also leading share and high growth opportunity for a $2.7 billion company? Can that -- how optimistic do you feel that can happen over the near term? 
James Craigie: Are you saying is my organization's ability to handle them or finding them? 
Unknown Analyst: No, finding them. At the size that you are, that's not going to be material at all, so bring you everything you want. 
James Craigie: Yes, it's funny in the acquisition world, every day of the week, I walk in and Brian Buchert [ph], who's in the room here at your table back there. Brian's our conduit for all the divestment bankers out there. Every day is a new day in acquisitions and things like that. The phone rings, interesting calls. We've been all over the country in this presentation. It's totally unpredictable. If you talk to the investment banker, they are not happy with the lack of acquisitions in the industry in the past 12 to 24 months. They're not making a lot of money. I think we're starting to see wins that there's going to be more opportunities for companies, either being sold or selling off parts in the year. But again, I kind of felt that last year, too, honestly, but we're seeing some winds right now start to blow that may be more opportunities for acquisitions for us this year in terms of people selling stuff. But again, it's never over to the cholerically-challenged Y chromosome talks there. So -- old yogi term, sorry. But we'll see what happens in the industry. But I'm a little optimistic right now. We'll have more opportunities coming up, and we're ready. My organization is drooling for an acquisition right now. Especially, it's kind of true that was actually -- maybe it's wasn't the worst thing in the world that we were doing the SAP startup to not have an acquisition on top of it. So of the SAP startup, a lot of the heavy lifting's behind us because a lot of the same people would have been involved with an acquisition. So maybe, we caught a lucky window where we didn't pick up a mass of acquisition on top of an SAP startup. We could focus a lot on the SAP startup. So now we're ready and waiting. We got the cash. We got the wherewithal. We know how to do acquisitions, so we just need the right one. But I won't do the wrong one. I would just won't do the wrong one. We've passed on some junk out there, and I could have maybe made some people in this room by doing a big acquisition with a lower margin #5 brand in some country where I don't really want to be and don't have scale and power, but I just don't won't do that. 
Unknown Analyst: My question was similar. I mean, given that you have all this cash and you said that you're reviewing so many acquisitions, are you willing to accept some dilution in the first year or 2 if you find the right thing that makes sense in the long run? 
James Craigie: It's possible. It's possible. We really don't like -- we'd like to be accretive within 1 year because when we get there, you'll see us, we're very aggressive on the synergies, both organizationally and manufacturing. But if there was something really, really awesome long term for my company, that was a guaranteed winner, will we accept the solution? That's possible. But usually it doesn't happen because we have a policy. Usually in 90 days, we make the people changes. We get rid of majority of people in the company we acquire within 1 year as we bring their products in-house. So usually after a year, we sometimes double or more the profit of a company just from synergies. But then we tap the growth potential after that. I didn't show the story today at OxiClean. OxiClean, we doubled the profits within 12 months, and the business was a great business. And within 2 or 3 years, we took the share of 50% using our marketing muscle of new products, so we've got a pretty good track record of how we handle acquisitions, so -- and then we won't overpay. We pay very fair prices. So it's kind of hard to imagine how it would be dilutive given our aggressiveness on cost savings and synergies. But if it's something -- I never say never, but I don't love dilutive deals because the world changes. 
Unknown Analyst: I'm going to send it over, though. 
James Craigie: All right. I just always -- the world changes, you think of something I think is a great acquisition, all of a sudden some major competitor enters the category 3 years out, and you've waited for 3 years to become accretive and you lost your window. So we're just very aggressive one on synergies. 
Matthew Farrell: Something to keep in mind there is that that's only one criteria is that accretive to EPS. That wouldn't be too high on the list, accretive to free cash flow would be higher. And also, internal rate of return is a big metric for us. So typically we are looking for 12% internal rate of return on anything, certainly any large deal we would do. 
James Craigie: We're looking hard. We're looking hard. But we have a, how can I say that -- there's not one acquisition that happened, and when I look back, and decide I wish we have made that one or we've missed it, nothing we've missed, which we had. I see a hand in the back. 
Unknown Analyst: SAP. So I know it's, to say the least, early days. But what's the time frame for when you think you'll start tapping into savings? Is it kind of a 2013 thing? And is it kind of gross margin for us? Or is it SG&A? Where do you think the biggest buckets are to go after for? 
Matthew Farrell: One thing about -- I've been through an SAP implementation in another life. And in the other life, we had did not have good discipline around working capital. We have mountains of it and not a little visibility to it. So if you look at the financial statements for Church & Dwight, it's pretty apparent that when you have cash conversion cycle under 30 days, there's going to be a whole lot that you're going to be pulling out of balance sheet to fund it. The second thing is our SG&A. I mean, our SG&A in comparison to virtually all our peers, save one,  is the lowest in the industry. So we have -- running the year with 3,500 employees. We're ending the previous year, 2010, with 3,600. If you go back a few more years, it was 3,800. So I trended down on people. So you probably heard Jim before talk about sales per employee, profits per employees, et cetera. So we're very lean. What SAP does for us is it's going to be good for our supply chain folks. They're going to have more access to data more quickly, and the whole goal here is to be able to continue to grow the top line without growing the employee base, frankly. So we'll be able to continue doing what we've been doing for a number of years to come because that's how we think about it. 
James Craigie: Any more questions? 
Matthew Farrell: I'd like to save Maureen 100 calls, so our effective tax rate for 2012? So we came in at, I guess, 34.8% for 2011. If you went back to 2010, we were 35.3%. So 35% for 2012, if you're working on models. And SG&A, is also expecting more leverage in SG&A. So we came in at 13.4% this past year. So it's going to be down 20 to 30 basis points in 2012. 
James Craigie: Let me just stand by telling you I recently told my board at my board meeting a week or so ago that I never cease to be amazed with the resiliency of my team. I have an awesome team. Over the years we just have a knack of being able to pull the right levers between organic growth, acquisitions, financials, engineering, things like that, to always get 10%. We know how to fight price wars. We know how to grow our power brands. We know how to defend our brands. It's an average perfect team. I really think the best team in the industry, and we will fight our way to do -- how anybody else is doing this year is to get double-digit EPS growth, again, in a very tough environment. And I'm very proud of them, and they're all in the room here today. So I'll just tell you 2012 is going to be a very challenging year, I think, for everybody. I've told some people earlier, I've seen some economic forecast  that this country will be in a recession by mid-summer. Not as long indeed as before, but I tend to be a pessimist. I disregard all the things about employment right now. I think this country has had it for more trouble short term than not. But my team will pull the right levers and get through that and deliver good quality earnings growth.
 And I hope to see you here or see you over the phones -- hear you over the phones in the next 90 days and start to tell you about that. So thank you very much for coming down here today. I hope you enjoyed the parade we threw out front. And I hope you get home safely with all the millions of people outside, and go Giants. Now go Yankees.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you on this call the company’s management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company’s financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the Company’s SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
Jim Craigie: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. It’s always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have excellent results to report. I will start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our third quarter business results which you read about in our press release this morning. I will then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspectives on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I’ll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We’ll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I am very pleased with our third quarter business results, which were in line with our expectations despite some serious headwinds. Since January, we’ve seen greater than expected increases in commodity costs and weaker than expected consumer demand in most of the categories in which we compete. Despite these significant headwinds, we delivered record quarterly net sales in both our Domestic and International business units and for the total company. These record net sales results were driven by 4.5% organic growth in the third quarter. This strong organic growth is largely volume driven and reflects positive momentum from the first and second quarter results of 1% and 3.3% respectively. This organic revenue growth momentum has continued into the fourth quarter, which is off to a strong start. Our third quarter gross margin was slightly above year ago but below our expectations, as the significant increases in commodity costs and product mix favoring our lower margin household business largely offset our hedging and cost cutting programs. As promised, our marketing spending was up in absolute dollars versus year ago to support the launch of new products across almost every one of our Power Brands. However, our marketing spending as a percent of sales was down versus year ago due to the strong growth of our heavily trade-driven household brands. Most importantly we delivered a 12.5% earnings per share gain for the quarter, which was on top of an 11.6% earnings per share gain in the third quarter last year. Thus, we have been steadily building momentum over the course of 2011, despite an increasingly difficult business environment. All CPG companies are fighting the same headwinds, but I continue to believe that no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. I’ll explain my rationale for that statement in a few minutes after Matt provides you with greater insights in the financial results for the third quarter. Go ahead Matt.
Matt Farrell: Okay, thanks Jim. Good morning, everybody. I’m going to start with EPS. Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.54 per share which compares to $0.48 in 2010 and this is a 13% increase from a year ago. Reported revenues were up 6.7%; our organic growth was 4.5% for the quarter and the strong organic growth has put us in an excellent position to once again deliver 3% to 4% organic growth for the full year. The 4.5% organic growth is comprised of 3.7% volume and an 80 basis points effect of price in the quarter. The positive price is largely driven by the Specialty division which is passing through raw material increases. In the U.S. Consumer business, we are yet to see a pullback in aggressive trade spending. However, we are seeing some positive price in our international business. The full-year organic revenue call is for 3% to 4% volume and flat price. By the way, the effect, if any, of our U.S. SAP implementation is not in our 3% to 4% call and it is not in our EPS guidance, and to the extent there is any incremental profit associated with that implementation, we will be reinvesting in marketing in the quarter. Now I’ll briefly review the segments. The Domestic business reported organic growth of 4.3% with 4.6% volume partially offset by 30 basis points of negative price. The 30 basis points of negative price in Q3 is actually the same as we experienced in Q2, although we had some help in Q3 from price increases in powdered laundry and condoms. This was our highest volume growth quarter for the U.S. business since Q3 of 2010. In the International division we had 3.9% organic growth driven by growth in Canada, Mexico, Australia and our export markets. This increase is driven by volume growth of 2.8% and positive price of 1.1%. We successfully implemented SAP in Canada that was the first phase of our project and we did that in October. We excluded 1.4% of sales in arriving at the International division organic sales and the excluded sales were attributed to customer orders which shifted from Q4 to Q3 in anticipation of this implementation. The 140 basis points may seem like a lot but in fact it’s only a $1.5 million. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 7.8% with volume down 1.8% and price up 9.6%. Remember I said before the price is primarily driven by price increases in the Animal Nutrition business, where we’re recovering increases in raw material costs. We had some volume softness in our International Chemicals business, which accounted for the division’s volume decline. I am turning to gross margin now, our reported third quarter gross margin was 44.2%, a 20 basis point expansion from a year ago. The increase in gross margin reflects cost reduction efforts somewhat offset by higher commodity costs, and unfavorable product mix. Regarding mix, as you can see on the schedules attached to the release, Household Products were up 7% in the quarter and Personal Care was up around 1%. The product mix created a lower gross margin in the third quarter. We now expect a similar mix effect in the fourth quarter. There will also be a drag of approximately 30 basis points on our Q4 gross margin related to expenses in preparation for our new California facility, which will open in the March, April timeframe. For full year, we expect commodities and cost reduction programs to largely offset each other. However, the impact of product mix is greater than our earlier expectations, primarily due to the success of our Household Products and as a result, we now expect our full year 2011 gross margin to be in the range of down 25 to 50 basis points. Now, marketing. Marketing spend was $92 million or 13.1% of revenues. This is an increase of approximately 2% from the prior year. It is also a 10-basis-point increase above the second quarter rate, but down 60 basis points from the prior year spending. Remember, we grew dollar share on seven of our eight Power Brands, thanks to the great execution of our sales and marketing teams. I might also add that we had very strong organic growth in Q3, especially in the back half of the quarter which somewhat outran our marketing spend. Value Laundry Detergent is clearly winning on shelf for Church & Dwight. If we back out our two Value detergents from our calculation of marketing as a percentage of sales, marketing as a percentage of sales is actually equal to Q3 2010. Looking ahead, we expect to increase spending again in the fourth quarter to over 14% of sales. The total marketing spending will be up approximately 3% versus year ago in Q4. As a percentage of sales, we expect to be flat to down for the year. I might add that total trade and marketing, which is another measure that is worthy of investors, is expected to be up $40 million in the fourth quarter and up $65 million for the full year. SG&A year-over-year was up $6 million in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.1% and flat with year ago. The higher SG&A costs in the quarter reflect higher year-over-year legal costs, information systems cost in support of our SAP implementation as well as higher R&D spending. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 18% compared to 17.2% last year. Now, income from affiliates. Income from affiliates increased $2.1 million due to higher income from a joint venture. With respect to other expense, other expense was $4.7 million lower than year ago reflecting lower interest expense as a result of our refinancing and debt repayment activities. Now I come to income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 36.8% which is significantly higher than last year’s 34.4%. The prior-year quarter included $3 million in benefits from tax settlements. We are forecasting an effective rate of approximately 35% for the full year 2011 and that compares to 35.2% for the full year 2010. Now I’m going to talk about cash. We generated $278 million of free cash flow so far this year. Netted in our free cash flow is $41 million of capital expenditures. Net cash from operations is above last year by $31 million. Our operating working capital as a percentage of sales was 9.8% at quarter end and by the way, operating working capital for us is defined as trade receivables, trade payables and inventories. We have over $275 million of cash on hand right now and $250 million of outstanding debt. For the first time in many years Church & Dwight is now net cash positive and we have about $650 million of available credit through our revolver and asset securitization facility. We expect to generate over $350 million of free cash flow in 2011 and remember that figure if after approximately $80 million of CapEx in 2011. The $80 million includes an $11 million investment for our West Coast facility on California, which is on track and $22 million for SAP and data warehouse upgrades. We did not repurchase any shares in Q3. We do plan on purchasing shares totaling approximately 80 million in the fourth quarter and this is in the interest of covering share creep from options exercises in 2011. This will only have a very slight effect to EPS in the quarter due to the late timing of purchases in the year. You may have seen that we announced an air pollution control joint venture with FMC and Tata Chemicals, called Natronx Technologies. This JV will manufacture and market sodium-based dry sorbents for air pollution control and electric utility boiler operations. Natronx intends to invest approximately $60 million to construct the facility in Wyoming in 2012 to produce these sorbents. The investment will be shared equally by the three partners. The joint venture will have no impact on EPS in 2011 but will be slightly dilutive to EPS in 2012. In conclusion, the third quarter highlights includes 4.5% organic sales growth driven primarily by volume. We delivered 20 basis points increase in gross margin driven largely by our cost savings programs that more than offset higher commodity costs that the whole industry is experiencing as well as product mix. We increased our market share in seven of eight Power Brands and EPS is up over 13% over a year ago. We are maintaining our annual earnings per share goal of $2.17 to $2.20 for the year, which is an increase of 10% to 11% over last year. Back to you, Jim.
Jim Craigie: All right, thanks, Matt. I’ll finish off the call today by adding a little color to the solid third quarter business results that Matt just took you through and I’ll provide my outlook on the year. Our solid third quarter results are directly linked to the seven factors that support my earlier statement that no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough business environment. First, we have the most unique product portfolio in the CPG industry; it consists of both premium and value brands, which puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy, as exemplified by our consistently strong EPS growth over the past 10 years. In particular, our value brands representing about 40% of our revenue base have experienced strong growth in this recessionary economy, as consumers are making smart choices by trading down and staying with the more value oriented brands. The business results for our value-based laundry business, which is our biggest business provide living proof of what is happening in the marketplace. In the third quarter, our ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent achieved record share and net sales results, up over 10% versus year ago. The ARM & HAMMER brand now accounts for one in eight liquid laundry detergent bottles sold in America. On top of these great ARM & HAMMER results are XTRA brand, which is our extreme value based liquid laundry detergent brand, also achieved its highest ever quarterly sales, up about 10% versus year ago, and it’s now the number two brand in liquid laundry detergent on a wash-load basis, accounting for about one out of seven loads of laundry in America. As a result, our two value-based liquid laundry detergent brands ARM & HAMMER and XTRA grew share in the first three quarters of 2011 totaling over one share point. Only one other competitor gained share in the first three quarters of 2011, and that was around 0.5 point in total. Our ARM & HAMMER Powder Laundry business is also on fire, with 10 consecutive months of dollar share growth. ARM & HAMMER Powder has gained more share growth (inaudible) about one point and year-to-date, a little over a point than any other power laundry detergent. The second factor which is the key driver of Church & Dwight’s success is that we have a proven record of building our Power Brands. We have over 80 brands, but eight of these brands of our Power Brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profit. From 2007 to 2010, we grew share on these eight Power Brands in over 80% of the quarters. In the third quarter this year as Matt said, we grew share on seven of our eight Power Brands. Two key factors drove these excellent share results. First, we have smartly reinvested some of our increased profits from a strong growth of our value brands to increased market share, marketing support on our eight Power Brands, by a total of 290 basis points or $140 million over the last three years. While our marketing spending was relatively flat versus year ago in the first three quarters of this year, we have increased our trade spending to defend our brands against competitively driven price wars. Thus our total advertising promotional spending against our brands is up 7% versus year ago in the first three quarters. We had planned and would have preferred to increase our advertising spending instead of our trade spending, but we had to deal with aggressive trade spending by one of our key competitors. The end result was the optimum mix of our advertising and trade spending that’s proven by our strong organic revenue growth results. Put another way, we don’t sit on a paddle saw at Church & Dwight and stick to our plans to increase advertising spending when faced with lower prices by our competitors. We responded quickly to the increased trade spending by one of our competitors and as I said, executed the optimal mix of advertising promotions to drive strong organic revenue growth. The other factor driving the growth of our Power Brands is our robust pipeline of new products. Over the past four years, new product delivered about 50% of the company’s organic revenue growth. We have shipped innovative new products in almost every key category this year to support delivery of organic growth target of 3% to 4%. We expect these new products to be as successful as our new products over the past four years. A sample of these new products in our household business include XTRA with Oxi Clean Laundry Detergent. This combination of two of our Power Brands has driven distribution gains for the XTRA brand this year, which has helped to deliver a high single-digit jump in sales. We launched the ARM & HAMMER brand with Oxi Clean co-branded detergent two years ago and that new product now represents over $100 million in annual sales and has a higher market share than the Aera (ph) and Cheer brands. The XTRA with Oxi Clean new product will enhance the cleaning power appeal of our XTRA brand, which as I told you a few minutes ago, is the number two brand in liquid laundry detergents on a wash-load basis accounting for one and seven loads of laundry in America. We also launched the new sensitive skin product for our Liquid Laundry Detergent business on the ARM & HAMMER brand to enhance the brand’s appeal for the 50% of consumer households who have sensitive skin issues. This helped to drive over 10% sales growth of the ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent business in the third quarter and bolstered this brand’s position as the number one value brand in liquid laundry detergents in America. Another new great household product being launched in the fourth quarter this year is ARM & HAMMER ULTRA LAST Cat Litter. Our new ULTRA LAST Cat Litter is the only cat litter where every granule is coated with baking soda to deliver all day freshness even if you forget to scoop out the soiled litter. We expect our new ULTRA LAST Cat Litter to build upon the huge success achieved by our ARM & HAMMER Double Duty Cat Litter line launched in 2010. That unique product eliminates both urine and feces odors. This steady stream of great new cat litter products has resulted in 31 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter is now the number 1 and number 2 clumping cat litter brand in most of the retailers in America. That’s pretty impressive for a category which we entered only 13 years ago. It also shows the strong consumer appeal of the ARM & HAMMER brand, which in total passed $1 billion in sales in 2010. Now, on the Personal Care side of the business, we had several exciting products in 2011. First, on our ARM & HAMMER Spinbrush business, we launched the new kids’ Spinbrush for Boys called My Way, which allows boys to personally decorate their toothbrush with popular peel and stick decals which come with product. This new Spinbrush follows on the heels of the My Way Spinbrush for Girls, which was a huge success in 2010. Our total My Way kids business is the number one kids’ battery brand for the latest 52 weeks more than doubling its share during that time. These successful new kids Spinbrushes have enabled our total Spinbrush brand to continue with dollar share leadership on the battery powered segment which it has held for the past 24 consecutive quarters. Another new personal care product is our new First Response Digital Ovulation Test, which enables a woman to better determine her optimal time to conceive and provides an unmistakable yes or no result. This new product and continued strong marketing support of our total pregnancy kit business resulted in our two brands, First Response and Answer, achieving a record quarterly share and the only two brands that grew share in the third quarter in this high margin category. Finally, our Trojan brand achieved solid share gains in both the condom and vibrations category. The share gain in Trojan condoms was driven by increased marketing support and the launch of our newest condom called BARESKIN, that’s bare as in B A R E, and you can figure out what that implies without my help. On the vibrations side, our net sales were up over 60% in the third quarter, behind the launch of a line of full-sized vibrators under the Trojan brand name. This product line is now available in all classes of trade as well through our website and the 800 number on our commercials. This is a category of new white space for the Trojan brand to answer. It represents a major long-term growth opportunity because we estimate that the total vibrations category currently has up to $700 million in retail sale with no clear branded leader. One side benefit of these great new products and the recent strong growth of our brands is that we have achieved significant distribution gains on almost every one on our powered brands in 2011. The share and sales impact of the distribution gains will play a major role in continued sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2011 and into 2012. Now there are many other new products that we have launched in 2011, but in the interest time I’ll move out of my review of the other factors driving Church & Dwight’s continued success and discuss our updated earnings guidance on the year. Let me quickly run though the five other key factors. Factor number three is that we have a proven history of ferociously defending our brands. We proved that in 2010 in our defense of the Oxi Clean franchise when it faced the entry of a mega brand extending into this non-chlorine laundry additives category where Oxi Clean is the number one brand. The powerful new competitor gained some share behind significant marketing spending that came largely at the expense of other competitors. Oxi Clean’s all outlet share in the latest quarter was actually up over 0.5 share point versus year ago and the brand’s share is also up over the first nine months of this year. The fourth factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of international business. While our international business represents only 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high single-digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the past five years. This strong growth continued in the third quarter as Matt mentioned earlier when international sales delivered record quarterly sales and strong organic growth of about 4%. Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margin through cost optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies, and launching higher margin new products. We expanded gross margin by 1,560 basis points in the past 10 years. While we did not improve our gross margin in 2010, we were successful in holding the 430 basis point gain achieved in 2009 despite major headwinds from higher commodity costs. As Matt told you earlier, our gross margin increased 20 basis points versus year ago in the third quarter of this year. While we had planned for a larger gain in our gross margin, we consider these results a major success because it’s already heard, most of our CPG competitors incurred significant gross margin declines of several hundred basis points in the third quarter, which reveals how well we have aggressively attacked cost savings and hedged key commodities. Nevertheless in light of our Q3 and year-to-date gross margin results and continued retail price wars, we are lowering our previously stated 2011 goal of annual gross margin improvement from 0 to 50 basis points to a decline of 25 to 50 basis points. We’re not happy with that forecast and are in the process of taking aggressive actions to drive gross margin growth in future years. This includes the early 2012 startup of our new manufacturing, distribution facility in Southern California. This move is part of our long-term commitment to expand gross margin by reducing complexity in our supply chain and reducing manufacturing and distribution costs. This plant will provide us with easier access to major populations in the West. The plant will also allow us to continue to grow both our liquid laundry and cat litter businesses, and position our businesses to be among the industry leaders in low-cost production and distribution. We are also working diligently on projects to reduce the manufacturing complexity of all of our product lines and lower the cost of purchase ingredients by combining our purchasing powers with other non-competitive CPG companies. Factor number six is our ability to tightly manage our overhead costs. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major CPG company. While our overhead costs were only equal to year ago in Q3, we are continuing to aggressively manage all overhead costs to stay best-in-class in our industry. Finally, factor number seven is our strong record on free cash flow conversion. We have almost quadrupled our free cash flow over the past 10 years. Over the past five years, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income was 128%, which was best-in-class in the CPG industry. As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we continue to improve in this area as our free cash flow for the first three quarters of 2011 was $278 million or 11% above year ago. This cash flow and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain such as building more efficient new plants and the acquisition of higher margin and faster growing leading brands. All these factors give me great confidence of our ability to deliver our aggressive 2011 business target despite the very tough business environment facing all companies these days. In my biased opinion, no other CPG company is as well as suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment. We were delivering exceptional EPS growth before the recession; we are delivering exceptional EPS growth during the recession and we are taking actions to ensure that we can continue to deliver exceptional EPS growth going forward regardless of the future economic environment. Let me switch gears now and simply talk about our outlook for the rest of 2011. As stated in the press release, as a result of the fact that our third quarter results were principally in line with our expectations, we remain confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate of $2.17 to $2.20, which is an increase of 10% to 11% over 2010, excluding a pension charge of $0.10 per share in 2010. We strongly believe that we can deliver this aggressive EPS target despite greater than expected headwinds from higher commodity costs and weaker consumer demands. Our confidence in delivering this aggressive EPS target is based on two key factors. First, we strongly believe that we can deliver the share gains in our power brands required to deliver our target of 3% to 4% organic growth. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, significant distribution gains we get from a majority of power brands and increased marketing support. All three of these factors should enable us to continue to deliver solid organic growth as reflected in our Q3 results and we currently project even stronger organic growth than our current quarter, the fourth quarter of this year. Second, we believe we can still minimize our corporate gross margin decline to just 25 to 50 basis points despite significantly higher commodity costs and higher trade spending. While this is less than we previously projected, it is still a better outlook than most of our CPG competitors. Three other points I would like to make before I open the call to questions. First, achieving our 2011 EPS target is not dependent upon making an acquisition. We continue to very aggressively pursue good acquisitions. We actually have recently completed another small acquisition of the BATISTE Dry Shampoo brand on June 28. This unique hair care brand meets all of our acquisition criteria. It’s the number one brand in its category of dry shampoos. It is gross margin accretive to our company with a gross margin of over 50%. It is growth accretive as demonstrated by its 90% compound average growth in net sales over the past four years. It is asset light as it currently produced by co-packers. Importantly, over 85% of BATISTE’s annual sales were in the U.K. which will increase our sales base in the U.K. by approximately 25%. Overall, a terrific small acquisition which will deliver EPS accretion starting in 2012. While we would love to make a larger acquisition, there are none available which meet our criteria and if there are no acquisitions recently by one of our competitors which we regret not buying. Second, I want to assure you that we are fully aware of the threat posed by new products being launched by our competitors. As I told you earlier, one of Church & Dwight greatest strength is its ability to ferociously defend our brands. We will prepare to do just that against the future competitive threat. Third, given our strong balance sheet and high cash flow yield, we will continue to smartly manage our capital. This includes the doubling of our dividend that we announced in February 2011 and the share buyback program of up to $300 million of the company’s common stock that we announced in September 2011. I want to emphasize that this share repurchase program will not inhibit us in any way in our continued pursuit of major acquisitions and it reflects of our confidence in future free cash flow performance. In conclusion, 2011 is shaping up to be a very challenging year due to the weaker than expected consumer demand, higher than expected commodity prices and continued price wars. But when things get ugly, you should place your bet on the company that has the product portfolio that thrives in such an environment and the management team that has a track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver strong EPS growth. This ends our presentation. I’ll now open the call to questions that you may have, and Matt and I will do the best to answer. Operator, go ahead.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian – Morgan Stanley: Good morning.
Jim Craigie: Good morning.
Matt Farrell: Good morning.
Dara Mohsenian – Morgan Stanley: So, appreciate your comments on ad spend versus promotion, but given you are going to end the year with marketing as a percent of sales nearly 100 basis points below the original level you expected, do you anticipate reboosting marketing spending next year as a percent of sales or are you comfortable with your share performance despite coming in with lower than expected advertising this year?
Jim Craigie: Look, Dara, we’re not going to give an outlook on next year yet. It is always our goal to increase ad spending. We always told you that we’ll get it up in the range of 13% to 14%. We’re just about 13% right now. So, we are getting to the point of where we think there is maximum results. But it’s always our goal initially to be looking to get it up every year. But again, I’m not going to give any details about next year. We will reveal that to you in our February earnings call.
Dara Mohsenian – Morgan Stanley: Okay. You didn’t repurchase any shares in Q3, but obviously plan to be more aggressive in Q4. Can you just explain the timing decision there and give us an update on how robust the acquisition pipeline looks at this point?
Matt Farrell: We did announce that in August, Dara, and October is when we essentially got it moving. So, there’s no story behind when we decided to do it. We just wanted to get it done before year-end, and through mid-year we had about a 2 million share run rate for option exercises. That’s slowed down a bit. So the $80 million is going to be enough to cover the option exercises in 2011. What was the second part of it?
Dara Mohsenian – Morgan Stanley: That answers it.
Matt Farrell: Okay.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: Good morning.
Jim Craigie: Good morning, Bill.
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: Hey, is there any sign that this promotional activity in laundry is slowing at all? Because if you look at some of the feedstocks and they’re going in the exact opposite way of the average price per unit in that category. Of course, I only have scanned data and I imagine it’s probably even worse in the un-scanned channels.
Jim Craigie: Yes, Bill, we are starting to see it slow a little bit. Overall pricing in liquid laundry in the third quarter was relatively flat versus the second quarter. There was little bit more aggressive pricing in the value side when we competed and driven by one of our competitors, and we had to take some actions to maintain our price gaps in that segment. But we are optimistic that pricing will begin to improve going forward, but again we don’t control the world there. If our competition doesn’t want to do that, then we have to maintain our price gaps to stay competitive.
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: What are the retailers saying about that because it seems like the category profit pool is shrinking because they (inaudible) some of the two.
Jim Craigie: I can’t speak for the retailers. I can just speak for me, and we’re doing fine.
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: Okay. All right, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Per Ostlund of Jefferies & Company.
Per Ostlund – Jefferies & Company: Thanks, good morning guys. Maybe just following on to the Bill’s question quickly, your pricing actions were a little bit, I would say, more targeted and maybe more modest than some of the competitors, but did the third quarter volumes benefit at all from any pre-buying ahead of the actions in powder, detergent or condoms at all?
Matt Farrell: No.
Jim Craigie: No, not at all.
Per Ostlund – Jefferies & Company: Okay, okay, I wouldn’t have thought so. Are you satisfied with your pricing now or do you see the need for additional pricing given maybe a little bit of the shift in the commodity picture? Or maybe even a different way, do you see potentially an opportunity to take more pricing if price gaps have opened up a bit here?
Jim Craigie: Well, two points. First of all, I mean, we don’t lead pricing in the laundry detergent category. We’re about a 10, 11 a share. The big dog in the category has about a 60 share. Secondly, on the powder side, we did take a double-digit price increase in the powder laundry business, and that is making its way into the marketplace as we speak. So, I think that you’ll see some higher pricing on powder going forward if that price increase gets fully reflected by the retailers.
Per Ostlund – Jefferies & Company: Okay, good, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Longley of Buckingham Research.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Hi, Alice, not Alex.
Jim Craigie: We know you Alice.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Detergents again. Did you say ARM & HAMMER was up 10% year-over-year and XTRA up 10% year-over-year?
Jim Craigie: Yes, at least that.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Okay, was that volume or value terms?
Matt Farrell: Dollars.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: How much was each one up in volume terms?
Jim Craigie: Alice, don’t play this game with us. We’re not going to get into volumes and dollars, it’s dollars. Dollars are where we get paid on, dollars are what you get paid on.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: But what I am trying to figure out is how much the pricing was negative year-over-year?
Jim Craigie: Little, very little is pricing.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Very little?
Jim Craigie: Yeah. Customers are bound with their fee, they want value laundry detergents.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: But I thought you just said that – where was your negative pricing for the U.S. in the quarter? I thought it was heavily weighted to detergents.
Matt Farrell: Let me help you with that, Alice. If you think about 2010, we weren’t as heavily discounting in 2010 as we are in 2011. So, year-over-year, if that’s what you are trying to get at to Q3, so it is true that year-over-year we would have had more trade spending in Q3 2011 versus ‘10 for laundry.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: So, again, what was the negative pricing for those two detergents year-over-year?
Matt Farrell: I couldn’t give you the specifics about brand pricing.
Jim Craigie: Call Maureen afterwards. She will still get the details for you.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: I mean like 2% to 3% or something like that?
Jim Craigie: Alice, move on. Call Maureen afterwards.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: And then the big question – well, the another one is, your operating margins have been going up for a number of years and I know you are not giving us guidance today for 2012 but what would – where can we get operating margin expansion going ahead? It seems like you have kind of reached to the end of the line for operating margin expansion.
Matt Farrell: There are a lot of things to drive gross margin expansion, Alice. One of them is obviously is our plant footprint. So as you know the York plant helped us overcome all the commodity price increases that the whole industry is struggling with for the last two years. That was a big factor for us and as you know we have the California plant that’s going be opening next year. So that’s going to pay dividends for us for years to come because it’s going to remove millions of miles of diesel fuel cost from our system. We also get gross margin expansion from our new product offerings, as you know our policy is to only introduce new products that have margins that are accretive to the brands. And acquisitions have also been an element historically of our gross margin expansion. It is typical when we buy something that we are so good at it. There is tremendous amount of cost synergies, so we can actually expand the gross margins for the acquired business over a period of years. Yes, we haven’t brought something big since 2008, which is when we brought Orajel, yet we have been hitting our numbers in 2009, 2010 and 2011 for EPS. So I think that should be very encouraging to investors.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Okay, my last one is with your balance sheet and all that cash flow, when do you get to the point where you are not being responsible to shareholders and not doing anything with all that cash flow?
Jim Craigie: Excuse me, our shareholders are up over 30% this year. I think we are being very responsible to our shareholders.
Matt Farrell: Let me take a swing at that, Alice. So, speaking about the cash, you go back sequentially. So in February of this year we doubled our dividend and we were trying to target a 2% yield and the stocks moved pretty well since then. Now our yield is 1.6%, so we’re going to revisit that again in February and when we give guidance that will be the right timing to think about the dividend again. You are correct; we generate more and more free cash flow every year and so obviously we have to be good stewards of the cash. As far as the buyback, you know we had announced a very modest buyback the $300 million just to cover share creep. Obviously, that could be expanded but that’s only a decision we would make with the Board and we looked at that probably at the same time that we did make the decision on the dividend.
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Gere of RBC Capital Markets.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: Hey, good morning guys.
Jim Craigie: Hey, Jason.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: So, I guess I’ll kind go on Alice’s question, but a little differently though. As we think about the evergreen targets, it feels like next year, 3% to 4% organic should be fine. So, I guess, we are expecting a bit more on the margin side. Can you talk maybe about the opportunities still on the SG&A side versus maybe on the gross margin, because I guess to kind of get back to that 10% EPS growth, that you guys have consistently delivered over the last decade, it does imply that there is more margin coming through and marketing spending is kind of at the low end of your 13%, 14% range. So I was just kind of wondering if can parcel that out that a little bit, and then I have a follow-up.
Jim Craigie: Well, on the SG&A side we already have best-in-class performance there, but we always (inaudible) do things, we’re implementing a new companywide healthcare program next year, which we think will help to keep healthcare costs in check, and beyond that we have other programs too to keep it very tight. We have a very tight overhead, and we’re going to keep it that way and even look for ways to improve upon it.
Matt Farrell: Yes, I would add to that, Jason, that our SG&A as a percentage of sales during 2010 was 13.5%, and we are tracking to be around that number, 13.5%, 13.6% for full-year 2011. As you know, we have had flat headcount at Church & Dwight for many years now. In order for us to continue to do that for another five years, that’s one of the reasons why we put in this SAP system, so we can make our folks even more productive going forward. So, we do expect to get some leverage out of SG&A going forward as a result.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So should we be anticipating and I guess I know you guys haven’t really talked too much about the plan and maybe relative to the York Pennsylvania. I mean can you kind of benchmark what type of cost savings you think could be there, could it be half the magnitude? I guess I’m just trying to get a framework of – it seems like gross margin would – after two years of not seeing gross margins go up because of the macro environment. Should we be anticipating that with pricing, with cost savings, the mix that this will be the driver and are you endorsing I mean the kind of 10% earnings growth for next year?
Jim Craigie: Yes, but Jason, it’s only November. You know our policy is we are not going to talk about next year until February; we are always pretty consistent with that.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: But do you feel pretty good going into it? I guess that’s the kind of – I mean just conceptually?
Jim Craigie: Jason, we have delivered three years of 10% EPS growth, so that speaks for itself.
Jason Gere – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. I will drop off and just get back in the queue if there are – if questions are unanswered. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Lackey (ph) of Wells Fargo.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo: All right, thanks. Can you give us the degree of expected sales from the pullforward in Q4?
Matt Farrell: Actually we can’t. We really don’t know how that’s going to go in Q4. Like I said it was small dollars in Canada and I think the fact that there was no disruption to our customers in Canada it went very smooth and that’s a tribute to the folks that worked on that and the company’s ability to execute. I think we and our customers will be pretty confident about the January 1 implementation as well.
Jim Craigie: Like I said before, to the extent it gets pull forward we will try to quantify it and call it out and to the extent it generates any incremental profit, we have an opportunity to invest it in marketing.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo: Yes, that’s appropriate. And Matt, I know you guys were at least looking laying out some new hedges in October. Can you elaborate on that at all?
Matt Farrell: Yes, that’s true. We typically do start making hedging decisions this time of the year and we have made some (inaudible) past but what I normally do is I wait until February and kind of tell everybody how much of 2012 we have hedged and in what areas, but that is our policy.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo: Okay. I know again waiting until February, I know lot of the stuff but if you can maybe kind of give us a general idea of what you are planning as for as CapEx, I know you got the $20 million JV investment there but any sort of parameters we should think about?
Matt Farrell: Remember the JV investment, that would be outside of – if you think about statement of cash flow, that would be investment in JV. As far as CapEx goes, we’ll probably be around $70 million next year if you ask me today simply because the investment in the California plant is going to be about $20 million. And as you probably know, we average absent these things that we have done in the last few years at the York plant, the SAP implementation in the California plant, absent those we run about $50 million to $55 million in CapEx, so $70 million to $75 million next year is a safe bet.
Joe Lackey – Wells Fargo: Great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Hey guys, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions here. First, in terms of the question Jason asked regarding the efficiencies from Victorville, I am not sure we got an answer but how should we think about the savings there vis-a-vis York? Is it half the size of York in terms of cost savings or is it about equal to what you got in Pennsylvania?
Matt Farrell: Joe, just to be fair we never quantified what the impact of York was. What I can tell you is that the plant in York is 1.1 million square feet and one out in California is 450,000 square feet. So it’s not only big, but the other element is the fact that we are going to benefit from lower distribution costs, which we didn’t get from the York plant. Remember York is only 150 miles away from Princeton. So, it’s still on the East Coast and now we’re actually moving the manufacturing West. So the composition of the save is going to be a little bit different. But, we haven’t quantified that stuff in the past, we just built it into our gross margin costs for the future.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Yes, I was just curious how we’ll compare it to York, but it sounds like you kind of gave us some thesis there, so that’s helpful. In terms of gross margin it looks like fourth quarter you are looking for gross margin to be down year-over-year. You had a modest increase in 3Q and obviously part of that is the California plant. But could you quantify for us what the input costs impact was on gross margin this quarter and I’d imagine that gets better rather than worse going forward?
Matt Farrell: Yes, why are you thinking that?
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: It seems to be the referring we’ve have heard throughout this earnings season, mother of staples names?
Jim Craigie: Yes, they are full of optimistic bullshit.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Could you tell us how you really feel?
Jim Craigie: Yes. So now what your view is that the world is getting a lot better for commodities?
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: No, it just seems like the year-over-year impact should be getting better.
Matt Farrell: Well, I think you are right from a year-over-year standpoint just because the comparisons get a little bit easier. I think that’s fair, but full year it’s a large drag year-over-year.
Jim Craigie: That’s just math that they get a little bit more favorable because they started to ramp up in second half of 2010.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Okay. Just one last one. The Natronx JV, what’s the strategic benefit for you guys, particularly given that’s going to be dilutive to next year?
Jim Craigie: In other words, why get involved?
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Yes because you’re going to lose money on it next year.
Jim Craigie: Joe, it’s a great new platform from our Specialty Products division. I mean, air pollution is going to be a majorly growing business in this country going forward with the new EPA regulations. This joint venture will deal with old coal-fired plants, which need a fairly efficient way to meet the new air pollution requirements, and so it’s a great opportunity for us to drive some good organic growth in our Specialty Products division. It’s worth the investment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets.
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: I also have a follow-up on the joint venture. How are the sales and profits going to be split and where will it be recorded in your P&L? And then, long-term what do you think the potential of the joint venture really is?
Matt Farrell: Hey, Connie, this is Matt. So, the JV – it’s a three way JV, so third, third, third. The results of operations will be split in that fashion, though, we reported on the other income and expense line, which is where we report JV income. The market is expected to be about $200 million to $400 million in sales, and this is in, I think, in 2015 is the projection. So, as Jim said, that’s going to build over time, and that’s about as far as we’ll go right now, as we haven’t even built the plant.
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Then also, I was intrigued by a comment you made about combining purchasing power with other non-competitive CPG companies. What do you mean by that?
Matt Farrell: We’ve actually made some progress on that, but I’m not going to name any names. What we mean by that, Connie, is that, let’s say, for example, we buy cartons, and lots of people buy cartons. So, we might go to a company who is a non-CPG company, who buys the same size of cartons as you, combine your volume and then, get a joint bid, and so you get more leverage that way.
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: So, it must have some real efficiency implications, because even everything you buy to look for non-competitive partners might offset the efficiency. So, how does the math work on that?
Matt Farrell: No. It doesn’t offset (inaudible) purely purchase price –
Jim Craigie: Purchasing power. This has taken our purchasing size as Matt said, somebody else’s purchasing size, putting that together and getting a better price out of the supplier, and the supplier will benefit now from a steadier long-term contract from both companies. The larger size will keep their plants humming. So, the bottom line is saving on our purchase price, which helps us drive the gross margin improvement.
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: Yes, that’s interesting, thanks. Then what’s the outlook for pension expense and contribution either at the end of this year or next year?
Matt Farrell: I think, you got me stumped there, Connie. As far as the defined benefit plan, we put that one to sleep a year ago in the fourth quarter. You may remember we had a big charge associated with that. So, DB benefit plans you’re talking about now are just simply the international one. I know in the Q we disclosed what the contributions are year-to-date. So, we’ll be filing that probably today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Redick (ph), Williams Capital.
Mike Redick – Williams Capital: Church & Dwight was sort of in the middle of a tug of war, if you will, between the States of New Jersey and Pennsylvania and with the new headquarters being announced last month, I was wondering if you could spend a couple of moments sort of taking us through that process and so some of the benefits that you may be able to see going forward from that announcement? Thanks.
Jim Craigie: Thanks. The answer is no. We made a lot of judgments; we decided to build our new headquarters about 10 miles south of our current headquarters here. The key building we are in here in Princeton in which we own – there is four buildings in Princeton, we own one. We are turning that into our world headquarters for R&D and our FPD divisions and the rest of the company is moving 10 miles South Dakota, Ewing into industrial park and I will just say that the State of New Jersey came for with incentives to make that a good deal for us. But I am not going to give any details as far what Pennsylvania offered and New Jersey offered. I would just say we are very happy to keep our headquarters in New Jersey.
Mike Redick – Williams Capital: Is there a timeframe as to when that transfer may take place, are we looking at next year?
Matt Farrell: Yes, we are thinking fourth quarter 2012 is what we are targeting right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.
Chris Ferrara – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I wanted to ask about maybe some of the differences in laundry between the track and non-track channels you are seeing right because if you just look at the scanner data and given obviously this is not perfect data, right, but it looks like in liquid laundry you guys have actually been the most aggressive on the negative pricing and it has been going on for quite a while, right given Henkel is doing something similar, but it looks like the lower end of the category is pricing pretty aggressively and you are the most aggressive. So I guess what’s different outside of the track channel that we might not be seeing?
Jim Craigie: No, what we seeing is somewhat true. Our friends at Henkel got very aggressive on pricing in the first part of this year and open up their price gaps for us. They are our key competitor in the value segment and we had to respond to protect our business. So that is exactly what’s going on. Again, I wanted to tell you, one of our greatest strength in this company is defending our businesses and we had to step in and defend our businesses. I would also keep you in mind that Henkel’s actions were an outcome of last year where another competitor started a price war in the whole category and Henkel got hurt pretty badly. So Henkel’s reactions this year were somewhat understandably, but unfortunately they responded and got very aggressive on price and we had to respond to them. So I’ve always said to everybody it’s very easy to start a price war and one of our competitors started that last year and it’s very hard to end a price war because those will get hurt and lose in past tend to keep aggressive in the future. We would love to see the price war end, but we didn’t start it and we can’t end it unless everybody else stops it. So that’s what’s going on.
Chris Ferrara – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I guess one last one. You guys said that Q4 is going to be your strongest organic sales growth quarter of the year, you know that’s great and it makes sense. I guess but unless you blow through the full year plus 3% to 4% rate, Q4 is actually going to be the weakest quarter of the year on a two-year stack basis, right? Just trying to think about underlying momentum and eliminate just a one-year ago comp, right. So are you actually seeing incrementally worsening environment in a lot of your categories because even on a three-year basis it’s the slowest quarter that you are seeing kind of a steady deceleration through the year?
Jim Craigie: You better talk to Maureen. That math doesn’t dry with our math.
Matt Farrell: I want to say it in a different way, Chris, so if we get 4.5% organic growth in Q3, and we’re expecting something similar or better in Q4. Tell me how you get into your week numbers?
Chris Ferrara – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So, just simplistically, right, the comp in a year ago was plus 2.8 in Q3, minus 1.4 in Q4, right? So, the comp is essentially getting foreign change points easier.
Matt Farrell: You’re forgetting you know we had that whole crazy day thing last year. We had fewer days in the fourth quarter, and we had more days in the first quarter. Remember that?
Chris Ferrara – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I do, and I get that’s why the comp is much easier in the fourth quarter, right, but it doesn’t change the fact that your growth doesn’t accelerate very much despite the comp getting much easier. That’s what I’m kind of – I guess, it’s also another way of understanding what the Q4 growth rate is going to look like too, right? Because that comp gets much easier because of that change in days dynamic.
Matt Farrell: See, last year year-over-year in Q4 2010 versus Q4 2009, we had fewer days year-over-year. In 2010 and 2011 Q4, we had the same number of days. So, we don’t have a day issue year-over-year. It is apples-to-apples. Last year looks like a low growth quarter on a reported basis, because of these days.
Operator: Your last question comes from Bill Chappell, SunTrust.
Bill Chappell – SunTrust: Good morning and thanks for taking the call. Just wanted to dig a little bit into the Tide Pods that are expected to come up in February, and P&G has kind of talked about it, pods being as much as 30% of the category. And I guess in some extent, this is a way of compaction or a next round of compaction. I think you’ve said you have something similar out there or planned. You talk about, I mean how much of a driver it could be for your margins going into next year and how you see that market?
Jim Craigie: It’s a hard one to call, Bill. I mean I first applaud Procter for driving the category through innovation, this is an innovation, and as far as what percent of the category it will take, that’s to be seen. I mean consumers haven’t voted at all yet, but I do applaud the push innovation, we will have our version of pods out there. It will be out there in the first quarter of next year. It will be margin accretive. We don’t get into margins by product and things like that but it is definitely a move in the right direction to drive gross margin improvement in the Laundry category, and we fully applaud it.
Bill Chappell – SunTrust: Looking at the past benefits from compaction, can it have a similar type benefit on freight logistics if it plays out?
Jim Craigie: It could. I mean I would tell you, Bill, there is one concern we have. There’s been a long term trend of people overdosing on liquid, and this product, you cannot overdose with. So, while there’s a gross margin improvement on a wash-load basis, and if you did exactly one wash load quantity for liquid, the pods, it could be a little dilutive on it as it cannibalizes liquid as far as taking away from the overdosing effect on liquid. So, that’s why we’re a little hedging our best. Apples-to-apples, pod versus liquid, when liquid is properly used is gross margin accretive, but liquid is not properly used in many cases. So, that could dilute some of the gross margin improvement, and that’s just something we got to see what plays out in the marketplace as the pods go out there, how many people buy, what effect that has on the liquids side of the business. So, there’s a little bit of give and take, and that’s why until the consumer starts voting, we won’t know the final answer.
Bill Chappell – SunTrust: Okay. Then just one quick one. I think for the first half of the year six out of eight Power Brands had been growing share, now seven. Did you tell you me what the new winner is?
Jim Craigie: The one that didn’t grow in the third quarter?
Bill Chappell – SunTrust: The one that is now growing that wasn’t growing in the first half.
Jim Craigie: I think it was Trojan. Trojan, I said earlier in my speech, we increased marketing spending in our BARESKIN product is doing exceptionally well. So Trojan has reignited share growth starting in the third quarter.
Bill Chappell – SunTrust: And is still kind of Orajel is the one that’s not?
Jim Craigie: That’s correct. That’s just like there was some little bit of private label activity in that category and we are dealing with that.
Bill Chappell – SunTrust: Great, thanks so much.
Jim Craigie: Thank you. All right. Let me wrap up this call today. Let me just say, I think some of you are looking for some very pretty results in a very ugly business environment. We are delivering outstanding results versus competition. We have strong organic growth. We have positive gross margin improvement where almost every competitor had negative and quite negative results and we are delivering double-digit EPS growth. As I said in my call, we have momentum on organic growth. We expect the fourth quarter to be our strongest organic growth quarter of the year on a percentage basis. Our Q4 EPS will be the highest EPS gain in the year and we have some competitors, I mean, in this current quarter actually calling negative EPS growth versus a year ago. So, if you want something pretty I would say to go buy a dog. If you want to buy the best performing stock in the CPG industry, buy Church & Dwight. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that, on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecast. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir
James Craigie: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start off this call by providing you with my perspective on our second quarter business results, which you read about in our press release this morning. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with his perspective on the financial details for the quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll return to provide some more detailed information on the performance of our key brands and discuss our earnings guidance for the year. We'll then open the call to field questions from you. Let me start off by saying that I'm very pleased with the second quarter business results, which were in line with our expectations despite some serious headwinds. Since January, we have seen greater-than-expected increases in commodity costs and weaker-than-expected consumer demand in most of the categories in which we compete. Despite those headwinds, we delivered 3.3% organic growth in the second quarter, which was up significantly from the 1% organic growth achieved in the first quarter. This organic revenue growth momentum has continued into the third quarter, which is off to a very strong start. Like other consumer package goods companies, our second quarter margin was below a year ago. However, through aggressive hedging and cost cutting, we were able to keep the gross margin decline versus a year ago to just 90 basis points, which was better than most of our competitors. As promised, our marketing spending was up 220 basis points versus Q1 to support a launch of new products across every one of our power brands. And most importantly, we delivered a 12% earnings per share gain for the quarter, which was on top of an 18% EPS gain in the second quarter last year. Thus, we had a good start to what has been a very difficult business environment so far this year. All CPG companies are fighting the same headwinds, but I continue to believe that no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough environment. I'll explain that rationale for that statement in a few minutes after Matt provides you with greater insights on the financial results for the second quarter.
Matthew Farrell: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. Second quarter GAAP EPS was $0.57 per share compared with $0.51 in 2010. EPS was up 12% from year ago. Reported revenues were up 5.3%, and our organic growth was 3.3% for the quarter. The 3.3% was within our May guidance of 3% to 4% for Q2 and has put us in the position to deliver 3% to 4% organic growth for the full year. The 3.3% organic growth is driven by volume with neutral effect of price mix in the quarter. The competitive environment is still aggressive in our categories, but we are now lapping a year-ago period with similar aggressive trade spending and competitive price wars. Price mix for the 5 quarters ended Q1 2011 averaged negative 2%, so the good news is that price mix for the total company was neutral in Q2 compared to negative 2% for the previous 5 quarters. We expected to be neutral in the second half, as well, after a little less positive than 90 days ago when we expected price mix to turn positive in the second half. We are seeing increased trade spend by competitors in several of our key categories, and this has affected our view on second half organic growth as well as gross margins. The full year organic revenue call of 3% to 4% is comprised of 3% to 4% volume and price mix of flattish to a minus 50 basis points due to the continued aggressive spending and product mix, somewhat offset by our pricing actions in the marketplace, which I'll talk about in a minute or so. Now let's briefly review Q2 for the segments. The Domestic business delivered organic growth of 2.1% with 2.4% volume, partially offset by negative 0.3% price mix. This is a significant improvement from the previous 5 quarters, which was over 3% negative price mix in each of those quarters. With respect to price increases, we took a 5% increase on Trojan in May and a 12% increase on powdered laundry detergent in July. Turning now to international. International had 3.1% organic growth in Q2, which was driven by growth in Australia and export markets. This increase is driven by a volume growth of 6%, partially offset by about negative 3% price mix. This quarter, we had higher price mix internationally than the domestic markets, primarily due to year-over-year promotional spending behind Household Products in Canada. For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 13%, with volume up approximately 6% and price mix up 7%. The price mix in this division is driven by price in the animal nutrition area where we are recovering raw material costs. The organic increase is primarily due to growth in the animal nutrition business where demand for our products has surged due to the hot weather in the U.S. The hot weather reduces the milk production by cows, and our products do the opposite, they increase the milk production of the cows. Okay, gross margin now. Turning now to gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was 44.5% and 90 basis points contraction from year ago. The decrease in gross margin reflects commodity costs, unfavorable product mix and higher trade spending. Price and product mix was a bit higher drag [ph] than expected but, for example, the dairy products that I just mentioned are a lower gross-margin product. When we entered the year, we expected 200 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of commodity headwinds on a full year basis. The current thinking is as follows: We still expect the 190 basis of commodity headwinds, which is a year-over-year increase of $20 million. On the plus side, we continue to expect 200 to 250 basis points of cost reductions. The effect of price and product mix is now expected to be flat to slightly negative for the full year, and the help we are getting from the recent price increases is being offset by trade promotions and product mix. As a result, we now expect our gross margin to be in the range of 0 to 50 basis points improvement. Marketing spend was $88 million or 13% of revenues. This was 220 basis points above the first quarter and 10 basis points above the prior year. Q2 is up 6% over a year ago in marketing spending. We grew dollar share on 5 of our 8 power brands, and this is due to great execution of our sales and marketing teams. Looking ahead, we expect to increase spending for the balance of the year compared to both the first half and the prior year, and we project full year marketing spending to be 13% to 13.5% of sales. SG&A is next. SG&A year-over-year was up $6.6 million in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 14%, up 20 basis points from a year ago, and the higher SG&A costs in the quarter reflect higher year-over-year legal costs as well as the effect of currency. Operating profit. Reported operating -- margin, pardon me, for the quarter was 17.5% compared to 18.7% last year. Income from affiliates increased $1.6 million due to higher income from a joint venture. Other expense was $3.2 million lower than year ago. This improvement is due to lower interest expense as a result of our refinancing and debt repayment activities. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 30.6% compared to last year's 36.2%. The lower effective tax rate is in line with our previous guidance for this quarter and is due to the benefit of the recently enacted New Jersey corporate income tax reform. This benefited the quarter as well as the full year by $0.04, as we discussed last quarter. This benefit helps to offset the $0.02 charge in 2011 for costs related to our new site in Victorville, California, as well as commodity costs than are significantly higher than expected when we planned the year. We are forecasting an effective rate of approximately 35% for the full year, and this compares to 35.2% for the full year 2010. So, very comparable. Today, we reported that our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company's common stock. I might add that the share repurchase plan will be funded out of available cash and will not affect our ability to fund acquisitions. Free cash flow, turning now to free cash flow. We generated $148 million of free cash flow so far this year. Netted in our free cash flow is $24 million of capital expenditures, and net cash from operations increased by $48 million over a year ago. The increase in net cash from operating activities is primarily related to favorable working capital changes, higher net income and higher deferred tax liabilities. Our operating working capital as a percentage of sales, which we monitor very closely, is 10.1%, and that is consistent with our 2010 average of 10.3%. Actually, a little bit better. By the way, operating working capital is defined as receivables, trade payables and inventory. We have over $163 million of cash on hand and approximately $650 million of available credit through our undrawn revolver and asset securitization facility, so we've plenty of dry powder. We expect to generate over $350 million of free cash flow in 2011, and remember that, that figure is after approximately $80 million of CapEx. That $80 million includes an $11 million investment in our West Coast facility in Victorville, California, and $17 million this year for our SAP upgrade. In conclusion, the second quarter highlights include a 3.3% organic sales growth driven by volume and an improvement in price mix trend. We increased our share in 5 of 8 power brands. And EPS is up over 12% from year ago.  Back to you, Jim.
James Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I'll finish off our call today by adding a little color to the solid second quarter business results Matt took you through and my outlook on the year. Our solid second quarter business results are directly linked to the 7 factors that support my earlier statement, that no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to deliver exceptional performance in a tough business environment. First, we have the most unique product portfolio in the CPG industry. It consists of all premium and value brands, which puts us in a position to thrive in any type of economy, as exemplified by our consistently strong EPS growth over the past 10 years. In particular, our value brands, representing about 40% of our revenue base, have experienced strong growth in recessionary economy, as consumers are making smart choices by trading down and staying with lower-priced brands. A great example of this is the fact that XTRA, our extreme value-based liquid laundry detergent brand, achieved its highest-ever quarterly sales and is now the #2 brand in Liquid Laundry Detergent on a wash-load basis, accounting for about 1 out of 7 loads of laundry in the United States. As a result, our 2 value-based liquid laundry detergent brands, ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, grew their total share in the first half of 2001 by 1.5 share points. Only other competitor gained share, and that was around 0.5 percentage in total. Also, our ARM & HAMMER Powdered Laundry Detergent business is on-fire with 7 consecutive months of dollar share growth, its highest monthly dollar share in 6 years in the month of June, and greater shared growth year-to-date in any other powdered laundry detergent brand. The second factor, which is a key driver of Church & Dwight's success, is that we have a proven record of building our power brands. We have over 80 brands, but 8 of these brands are our power brands, which generate 80% of our sales and profits. From 2007 to 2010, we grew share on these 8 power brands in over 80% of the quarters. In the second quarter of this year, we grew share on 5 of our 8 power brands. Two key factors drove those excellent share results. First, we have smartly reinvested some of the increased profits from the strong growth of our value brands to significantly increase marketing support on our 8 power brands by a total of 290 basis points or $140 million over the past 3 years. While our marketing spending was relatively flat versus a year in the first half of 2011, please keep in mind that we traditionally save the bulk of our advertising dollars for the second through the fourth quarters to support the launch of our new products. And we do intend to spend more marketing dollars in the back half of 2011 to support continued share growth in our power brands. The other factor driving the growth of our power brands was a robust pipeline of new products. Over the past 4 years, new products delivered about 50% of the company's organic revenue growth. We are shipping innovative new products in every key category this year to support delivery of organic growth target of 3% to 4%. We expect these new products to be as successful as our new products over the past 4 years. A sample of these new products include the following. First, XTRA with OxiClean laundry detergent. This combination of 2 of our power brands has helped to drive significant distribution gains to the XTRA brand this year, which as I mentioned a minute ago, delivered record sales in the second quarter and should continue to deliver strong sales growth for the rest of this year. We launched the ARM & HAMMER with OxiClean co-branded detergent 2 years ago, and that new product now represents over $100 million in annual sales and has a higher market shares in the era and tier brands. We are also launching a new sensitive skin product for our Liquid Laundry Detergent business on the ARM & HAMMER brand to enhance the brand's appeal to the 52% of consumer households who have sensitive skin issues. This will to help to drive continued growth of the ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent business, which has achieved greater share growth in the past 52 weeks than any other major liquid laundry detergent brand and account for 1 in 10 liquid wash loads in the United States in the second quarter. Another great new product being launched in 2011 is a 40-pound large size of our ARM & HAMMER Double Duty Cat Litter. We first launched the ARM & HAMMER Double Duty Cat Litter line in 2010, and it's been a huge success. This product eliminates both urine and feces odors. The ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter brand consumption grew over 15% in the second quarter, leading to the brand's 13th consecutive quarter of net sales growth, 10 consecutive quarters of share gains and is now the #1 or #2 clumping cat litter brand in almost every major retailer in the United States. That's pretty impressive for a category, which we entered only 13 years ago. It also shows the strong consumer appeal in that ARM & HAMMER brand, which in total, has now passed $1 billion in sales. On the personal care side of our business, we have several exciting new products in 2011. First, on our ARM & HAMMER Spinbrush business, we are launching 3 exciting new products. One is called the My Way! Spinbrush for boys, which allows boys to personally decorate their toothbrush with popular peel and stick decals, which come with the products. We launched the My Way! Spinbrush for girls in 2010 and had a huge success. Our total My Way! Kids business achieved a record share of 51% in the second quarter, which strengthens our position as the #1 kids battery brand of the latest 52 weeks. We are also launching a new Spinbrush called Globrush, which lights up for 2 minutes to provide an appealing queue to kids for how long they should brush. And finally, I'm proud to announce an exciting new toothbrush called Tooth Tunes. Tooth Tunes is a manual toothbrush that plays popular commercial music for 2 minutes to encourage proper brushing. This brush will be available in 3 SKUs: Top 40, Pop and Legends; with 3 different songs in each SKU featuring famous singers or bands such as Justin Bieber, Black Eyed Peas and The Rolling Stones. Initial retail response to the Tooth Tunes product line has been outstanding, with strong display support expected during the upcoming holiday season. These 3 great new products should enable our Spinbrush brand to continue its solid share leadership in the battery-powered segment, which it has held for the past 23 consecutive quarters including an almost 300 basis point share gain in the second quarter this year. Another new personal care product is our new FIRST RESPONSE digital ovulation test, which enables a woman to better determine her optimal time to conceive and provides an unmistakable yes-or-no result. This new product, in continued strong marketing support of our total pregnancy kit business, resulted in our 2 brands, FIRST RESPONSE and Answer, being the only 2 pregnancy kit brands to grow share in the second quarter, which increased our overall share leadership in this high-margin category by 240 basis points. Finally, we have launched a line of full-sized vibrators under the Trojan brand. This product line is available in all classes of trade in 2011 as well as through our website and the 800 number in our commercials. This is a category of new white space for our Trojan brand to enter. It represents a major launch-and-growth opportunity because we estimate that the total Vibrations category currently has up to $1 billion in retail sales with no clear branded leader. Our total Trojan vibrations business had a 35% increase in gross sales in the second quarter versus a year ago and achieved a record quarterly share of over 61%, up 6 points versus a year ago. One side benefit of all these great new products and the recent strong growth of our brands is that we have achieved significant distribution gains in almost every one of our power brands in 2011. The share and sales impact of the distribution gains will play a major role in continued sales growth in the back half of 2011. There are many other new products that we are launching in 2011, but in the interest of time, I'll move on with my review with the factors driving Church & Dwight's continued success and discuss our updated earnings guidance on the year. Let me quickly run through the 5 other key drivers. Number three is that have we proven history of ferociously defending our brands. We proved that in 2010 in our defense of our OxiClean franchise when it faced the entry of Omega brand extending into the non-chlorine laundry additives category where OxiClean is the #1 brand. The powerful new competitor gained some share behind significant marketing spending but disproportionally came at the expense of other competitors. And if any competitor picks a fight with us, they better be ready for a never-ending death match, as exemplified by the fact that OxiClean's share for the past 6 months of 2011 was only 20 basis points below a year ago but over 600 basis points greater than it stood when we bought the brand in 2006. The fourth factor behind our continued success is the strong growth of our international business. While international business represents only 20% of our total revenues, it has delivered high single-digit sales growth and double-digit operating profit growth over the past 5 years. This strong growth continued in the second quarter, as Matt mentioned earlier. Factor number five is our long history of success in expanding gross margins through cost optimization programs, supply chain restructuring, acquisition synergies and launching higher-margin new products. We expanded gross margins by 1,560 basis points in the past 10 years. While we did not improve our gross margin in 2010, we were successful in holding the 430 basis point gain achieved in 2009, despite major headwinds from higher commodity costs. As Matt told you earlier, our gross margin declined 90 basis points in the second quarter, but we consider that a success because, as you've already heard, most of our CPG competitors incurred much bigger gross margin declines in the second quarter, which reveals how well we have aggressively attacked cost savings and hedged key commodities. In light of our Q2 growth margin result and continued retail price wars, we are lowering our previously stated 2011 goal of annual gross margin improvement from 50 to 100 basis points to 0 to 50 basis points. While I never like to lower an annual goal, we still expect positive gross margin improvement in 2011, which is better than most of our competitors, and we're in the progress of taking actions to drive gross margin growth in future years. This includes the recently announced addition of a manufacturing and distribution facility in Southern California. This move is part of our long-term commitment to expand gross margin by reducing complexity in our supply chain and reducing manufacturing distribution cost. This plant will provide us with easier access to major populations in the west. The plant will also allow us to continue to grow both our liquid laundry and cat litter businesses and position our business to be among the industry leaders in low-cost production and distribution. This plant is expected to be ready for production in 2012. And like our recently completed plant in York, Pennsylvania, it's expected to play a key role in driving future gross margin improvement. We are also working diligently on projects to reduce the manufacturing complexity of all of our product lines and lowering the cost of purchased ingredients by combining our purchasing power with other non-competitive CPG companies. Factor number six is our ability to tightly manage our overhead costs. Church & Dwight currently has the highest revenue per employee of any major CPG company. While our overhead costs were up slightly in Q2, largely due to higher-than-planned legal costs, we are aggressively managing all overhead costs to stay best in class in our industry. Finally, factor number seven is our strong record of free cash flow conversion. We've almost quadrupled our free cash flow in the past 10 years. Over the past 5 years, our free cash flow conversion as percent of net income was 128%, which was best in class in the CPG industry. As Matt told you a few minutes ago, we continue to improve in this area, as our free cash flow for the first half of 2011 was $148 million, up $45 million or 43% above a year ago. This cash flow and a strong balance sheet has enabled us to smartly invest in our future through both investments in our supply chain, such as building more efficient new plants, and the acquisition of higher-margin and faster-growing brands. All of these factors give me great confidence of our ability to deliver aggressive 2011 business targets despite the very tough business environment facing all companies these days. In my biased opinion, no other CPG company is as well suited as Church & Dwight to thrive in any type of business environment. We were delivering exceptional EPS growth before the recession. We are delivering exceptional EPS growth during the recession. And we are taking actions to ensure that we continue to deliver exceptional EPS growth going forward regardless of the future economic environment. Let me switch gears now and specifically talk about our outlook for the rest of 2011. As stated in the press release, as a result of the fact that our second quarter results were principally in line with our expectations, we remain confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate of $2.17 to $2.20, which is an increase of 10% to 11% over 2010, excluding a pension charge of $0.10 per share in 2010. This annual forecast reflects evenly balanced EPS for the remaining 2 quarters of 2011. We strongly believe that we can deliver this aggressive EPS target despite greater-than-expected headwinds from higher commodity costs and weaker consumer demand. Our confidence in delivering this aggressive EPS target is based on 2 key factors. First, we strongly believe that we can deliver the share gains on our power brands required to deliver our target of 3% to 4% organic growth. These share gains are expected to result from our innovative new products, significant distribution gains across the majority of our power brands and increased marketing spending. All 3 of these factors should enable us to continue to deliver solid organic growth, as reflected in our Q2 results. Second, we strongly believe that we can still deliver gross margin expansion of 0 to 50 basis points despite higher commodity costs and higher trade spending. While this is less than previously projected, it is still a better outlook that most of our CPG competitors. Three other points I'd like to mention -- to make before I turn the call over to questions. First, achieving our 2011 EPS target is not dependent on making an acquisition. We continue to be very aggressively pursuing on acquisitions. We actually made a recent small acquisition of BATISTE dry shampoo brand on June 28 of this year. This unique hair care brand meets all of our acquisition criteria. It is the #1 brand in its category of dry shampoos. It is gross margin accretive to our company, with a gross margin of over 50%. It has high growth potential, as demonstrated by its 9% comp on average growth rate and net sales growth over the past 4 years. It is asset-light as it is currently copexed. Importantly, over 85% of BATISTE's annual sales of $20 million are in the U.K., which will increase our economies of scale in this country by approximately 25%. Overall, a terrific small acquisition, which will deliver EPS accretion starting in 2012. Second, I want to assure you that we are fully aware of the threat posed by new products being launched by our competitors in the second half of 2011. As I told you earlier, one of Church & Dwight's greatest strength is the ability to ferociously defend our brands. We will be prepared to do just that against future competitive threats. Third, as Matt mentioned a few minutes ago, given our strong balance sheet and high cash flow yield, we are now seeing a share buyback program of up to $300 million of the company's common stock. Now I want to emphasize, and listen to me clearly, that this share repurchase program will not inhibit us in any way in our continued pursuit of major acquisitions, and it is in reflection of our confidence in future free cash flow performance. In conclusion, 2011 is shaping up to be a very challenging year due to the weaker-than-expected consumer demand, higher-than-expected commodity prices and continued price wars. But when things get ugly, you should place your bets in the company that has the product portfolio that thrives in such an environment and a management team that has a track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver strong EPS growth. That ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Per Ostlund of Jefferies & Company.
Per Ostlund - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I know you touched on this a couple of times in the prepared remarks, but on the repurchase authorization, is there any timeline to it? And by that, I mean, is there any -- is there a mandate in the authorization that it expires on X date? Or alternately, do you have any sort of sense as to how it's going to be paced?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, Per, this is Matt. The answer to that is no. There isn't an end date, so it's open-ended. So the way it's worded, essentially, is that we can purchase from time to time in the open market. That does not preclude us from doing a 10b-5 filing so that we can actually buy through blackout periods. In that case, you would actually specify the amount that you would be buying. But we don't -- is that enough for you?
Per Ostlund - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Yes, that works. I mean, I guess maybe you also touched on that it won't preclude any sizable acquisitions. Does it signal anything in terms of just the availability of anything that's that attractive of size?
Matthew Farrell: One thing to think about, Per, is that our year-to-date share creeps has a run rate of about 2 million shares. And we have talked from time to time in the past with investors about the significant free cash flow that the company generated -- generates even after paying dividends. So to the extent that we would take share creep off the table, I mean, a run rate of 2 million shares at a price of $4 to $50 would be $80 million to $100 million annually, which we would pay out of available cash. And remember, we have $615 million of undrawn lines between our revolver and our asset securitization facility, so in no way would this affect our ability to fund acquisitions.
Per Ostlund - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: That's excellent. Maybe just one quick one on your organic sales forecast, so you kept at the same here at 3% to 4%. Looking sort of to the back half, do you see the trend kind of continue or that specialty behind the animal nutrition really kind of continues to be the above trend? Or do you see may be the 3 reporting segments sort of normalizing all around that same level as the consumer side picks up behind some of the innovation?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, I think fall and winter will eventually come so the temperatures will come down. And the effect [ph] we're seeing right in the dairy products is going to fade.
James Craigie: Yes, then we expect stronger growth of the summer domestic and continued strong growth international in the second half. Yes, Per, and FPD [ph] will fade to back to normal growth levels.
Matthew Farrell: Yes. In the first quarter, our consumer business in the U.S. had 1% organic growth, so we're 2% now, so domestic business is accelerating Q1 to Q2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: So, couple of things. Have you commented or could you comment at all on the outlook for 2012 commodity costs?
Matthew Farrell: Not at this time.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: And not even on the percentage that hedged, perhaps?
Matthew Farrell: We could do that. We're about 10% to 15% hedged for next year, and a lot of our decisions with respect to hedging in our long-term contracts will be made between now and when we get to the end of the third quarter.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Okay. And then could you tell us how the Trojan condom business did and if you're losing share to Durex and if there's been any change in behavior by the Durex leadership?
James Craigie: Yes. The condom business is doing very well. We've lost a couple of tenths to share point this year so far, but that's not a problem. Our sales are up. We took a price increase in effect in Q2, and competition has followed. We're also launching higher-margin new products, which is helping the profitability category. Quite honestly, the competitions coming from the Ansell company, they've had some gains in distribution of that that have cost a couple of tenths off us. There's been no sign of any increased activity out of Durex, which is part of SSL, which is now part of Reckitt.
Matthew Farrell: There's some timing also going on, so in condoms, we had some account resets that happened in Q1 this year that would normally happen in Q2. So it is a little bit lumpy, but all in all, the business is healthy.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Okay. And this higher legal cost in the second quarter, is that going to continue through the rest of the year, do you expect?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, I do, I do. It's expected to also be a factor in the third quarter.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Do you know -- could you quantify it?
Matthew Farrell: No.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Okay. You talked about international having strong growth, the 9 -- we estimate about 9% with currency, so the base business, maybe up 3% or so, 3% to 4%?
Matthew Farrell: Well, the organic business was up 3%.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Right, so is that not at that rate you expect, or do you expect to be able to grow faster than that over time?
Matthew Farrell: Your FX calculation is correct for Q2. I want to make sure we're on the same page. What you got, around 9%?
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Yes.
Matthew Farrell: Right. So the organic was 3% for the second quarter.
James Craigie: And we expect continued organic growth in that area of 3% to 4%, 3% to 5%.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Okay. And then you talked about OxiClean has lost a bit of share, you're going to be sure to defend. Can you give us just a little more color on what's going on in the marketplace? Who's taking share and why, and why you think that -- what do you think it takes to reverse that?
James Craigie: Yes. OxiClean is the one business which kind of surprised us this year in the sense that the category was very weak in the first quarter, almost down double digits. Now that followed 2010 in which there was a major competitive war as a large competitor entered the category. A lot of spending was put behind that, a lot of spending was done to defend against that. As I said, we defended very well and held our share and other competitors took the loss as this new entry gained some share. And then surprisingly, I mean, the category's very strong last year, and then surprisingly this year, the category started very weak. We're still trying to figure out why, quite honestly. We're not sure if there's a lot of pantry-loading last year with all the trial incentives and all the defensive spending or whether possibly this category is a premium category, is sort of a luxury category that people could back off. I know the good news is the category came back a little positive in the second quarter. So -- but it did surprise us. Our share basically is flat in the first half of the year, which is okay. It was strong in the first quarter, down a bit in the second quarter. But overall, flat on the year. But the good news there is it looks like that's a sign of category growth is coming back, which is important to us, and we have some good initiatives planned in the second half of the year that continue to maintain or hopefully drive some share growth there. But it's the one surprise of the category that surprisingly went very weak in the first quarter of the year on us.
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: And then...
Matthew Farrell: Carol, we got a long queue here. That's kind of last...
Caroline Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Go ahead. That's fine.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just can you give us a little more color on the step-up trade promotion? I mean, is it across the board or is it -- are you seeing it more just in the detergent category? And then are you seeing pressure from a specific player that's making you step this up? Are you doing this proactively to kind of build your market share?
James Craigie: Yes. Bill, it's largely the household side of the business, a little bit in oral care. It's competitively driven. What I said a year ago when a certain big competitor started price wars -- price wars are not good for everybody. Those who start it usually win some share at first, and then they upset the guys who lose it. We also won last year in fighting back, but some other competitors lost, and gee, guess what those competitors who have lost last year are being very aggressive this year with spending and forcing the rest of us to continue aggressive spending. So that's where it is. Overall, again, liquid laundry is always just one of the biggest categories there. We've done very well in the category. We're very good fighters in that category, and our value positioning puts us in good position, but there has been an unexpected high level of trade spending continuing in that category, a little bit in litter, I would tell you, and oral care also has been very competitive.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And just to kind of dig into that, I mean, my understanding was part of, at least, P&G's price increase taken in June was a rollback on trade promotion on the liquid side. Does this imply that, that's not happening? Or are you just seeing trade promotion from the other players more in kind of the mid- and lower-tier side of the market?
James Craigie: Well, all the trade [indiscernible] spend back was talked about in the second half of this year. So we still don't have a clear picture of whether that's going to happen. And the real driver of spending is Henkel out there right now, which again was the one who lost share last year and is trying to get it back this year. But we're still -- the issue of hopefully lower trade spending, it's still, jury is still out on that one. I would say it doesn't look hopeful, but jury's still out.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And last one, did you say you wouldn't say what the legal expenses were for? Or you just wouldn't quantify the cost?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, we weren't going to forecast the cost for the second half for legal.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But can you tell us why, I mean, what the issue is that's stepping it up?
Matthew Farrell: It's just related to the legal -- some litigation we have described our 10-Qs. There's no new ones there, it's the same ones we've had for a while.
Operator: Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Investment.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc: I just wanted to clarify and follow up on Bill's last question, just on the commercial spending because, if I look at the last couple of Nielsen reports, particularly the last one, it looked like your promotional spending was up dramatically, and Procter's was down. So I just want to clarify, and I know it was only Nielsen, and it was only one month or whatever, but just to be clear, you want to maintain the same price gap that you've had historically in most of your categories or in laundry specifically. Is that correct? So if they take more pricing or if they back off promotional spending, you'll follow in time, is that right?
James Craigie: In general, that's right. We will, but they're not the only competitor in the category, and we also have to be competitive versus our value players in the category. [indiscernible] That's where the problem is right now, that Henkel lost share big time last year and is being very aggressive on trade spending this year, which will affect everybody in the category. And we have defended very well and, in fact, grown our share despite that, but it has caused us to spend more trade spending than we would like.
Matthew Farrell: The announcement by Henkel with respect to pulling back on trade promotional spending is not obvious to us at this point in first week of August.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Just a couple of quick ones. First in terms of pricing, you obviously mentioned this morning you've taken a couple of pricing actions. You led in condoms, and I think you followed in detergents. What are the chances that we see additional pricing in the back half of this year in other categories?
James Craigie: Slim to none.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then secondly on the gross margin side, the change in gross margin guidance this morning, you also mentioned there were 3 factors there: the commodity pricing, promotional activity and product mix. Is there one that stands out that's really driving that? Or are they all contributing to it roughly equally?
Matthew Farrell: I mean, it's a range, Joe. So just to repeat what I said, product mix is certainly effect in gross margins. And yes, we got the prices increases, but because of how aggressive some of our competitors have been in some categories, it's not flowing through, getting the help that we thought we were going to get from it.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay. And then just one last one, any thoughts on a detergent using POD technology similar to what P&G is working on or about to launch?
James Craigie: Yes, we have lots of thoughts, thank you.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Anything in the pipeline?
James Craigie: We have lots of things in the pipeline.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.
Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Just a couple here related to the pricing and especially in the value category, gentlemen. Is your sense that it's just Henkel being extremely aggressive to try to regain that share? Or is there something else afoot here in the category linked to the consumer?
James Craigie: No, it's primarily just an aggressive competitor out there. I mean, I should mention good news is the liquid laundry category, which was down about mid-single digits in the first quarter, was down only about 1% in the second quarter. So the category looks like it's coming back, which is good news. And it's just that competitor who lost badly in share a year ago who was trying to regain the share this year. But again, as I told you on my call, our share growth is the best of anybody in the category, and we will defend ourselves aggressively, but that is meant that we kind of spend some trade spending to neutralize the actions of this competitor.
Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And then Jim, on the acquisition, you outlined again it's going to give you more scale in your U.K. operations. What's your acquiring here, is it transferable to other markets? What other things that this acquisition give you? And how do you see the opportunity, I guess, to ramp the sales base here fairly quickly?
James Craigie: Again, 80% of sales are in the U.K., but 20% are on the other countries, including other parts of Western Europe and United States. We do see opportunity to grow with in all of those markets. It's a very unique product. Dry shampoo is in one way is an old product but a very hot product recently. A lot of hair care companies are telling women not to shampoo their hair every day because it will strip their hair of oils, and as a result, this business has had quite a little pop out there. Again, the comp on average growth rate of almost 90% over the past 4 years over in the U.K., was quite impressive to us. The margins were impressive. The product's made in cold packers today, but we have the ability to bring that in-house possibly. And we just think it's got good growth potential, so it was kind of a unique product that we got at a fair price, and we think it has good growth potential going forward.
Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And other immediate plans, Jim, in meaning of the next 2 years or so to roll, to expand that very quickly in other markets outside the U.K.?
James Craigie: We're still in the process of making those kind of decisions.
Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Final question is related to the share repo. Generally -- historically you haven't really had any. I guess, following on alluding to an earlier question, should we view this anything more than to offset the share creep, I mean, as far as your opportunities with the available excess cash?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, you're right, we haven't bought back shares since the year 2000, and we've been generating an increasing amount of free cash flow over the last couple of years. Earlier in the year, we doubled our dividend because we had significant cash flow that we were generating, as I said before, $350 million annually after CapEx. The dividend is about $100 million requirement on a full year basis, so that leaves us $250 million. And as I said before, we have tremendous amount of available lines, existing lines of $615 million, and we can actually expand our revolver in addition to that if we want to do something larger. So there's no message with respect to the announcement other than we have the ability now to take share creep off the table.
James Craigie: Yes, I would just add to that. We have a great cash machine. Matt and his crew have generated the greatest percentage of free cash flow of any competitor out there. It's just to the point now where we probably have no debt. We are working hot and heavy on acquisitions. And this in no way will inhibit that, given the amount of cash we have, the borrowing capacity we have. So please don't read into this any change in our desire to continue to be a great acquirer in this category, and that's it, just don't. This is just an opportunity to buy back some shares because we have so much damn cash.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Longley of Buckingham Research.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Alice. Your guidance assumes gross margins are up in the second half. Can you mainly tell us why you think they'll be up? Some of the companies are guiding to even worse gross margin declines in the September quarter than the June quarter. And could you tell us what we're going to see in terms of gross margin comps in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, as well?
Matthew Farrell: Alice, we would never forecast the gross margin by quarter year-over-year. As we've said before, we have lots -- the things that influence year-over-year gross margin is the timing of our cost savings programs. And you probably remember that we accelerated some of -- to pull those some into the year. We started the year expecting $200 million or probably 200 basis points of costs savings, and we're now at 200 to 250. So across savings programs that we pulled into year are going to influence the second half of gross margins. The other thing, too, is we have the launch of some of these new products that Jim made reference to, the Tooth Tunes and neti pot, which are also high-margin products.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So if that's the case, won't mix be better in the second half than it was, you called it out as a negative, this quarter?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, we expect price mix in the second half to be neutral. It could be neutral to up a bit. But actually thought it was, we -- 90 days ago, we were pretty convinced it was going to be a positive trend in the second half. And now, we think, it's going to -- it won't be, and that's the reason why we went from 50 to 100 to 0 to 50.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And the way to think of price mix is that maybe price and mix together are plus 2 and dealing is negative 2?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, on a full year basis?
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Well, for the second half.
Matthew Farrell: One thing that is probably worth pointing out is that, if you looked at our gross margins last year, our lowest-margin quarter was the third quarter where we were at 44%. And if you look at our trend so far this year, first quarter was 44.9%, and second quarter was 44.5%. So you can kind of do the math on what you think the range will be in the second half. But that, so the comp actually has influenced it as well year-over-year.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Well, it's reasonable to think that gross margin's going to be up in the third quarter, right?
Matthew Farrell: Year-over-year? Yes.
James Craigie: Yes.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yes, okay. And then my other question is on the dividend, which you doubled last February, I guess. Could you sort of comment on your leanings for increasing that another 50%-plus when we come to the February whatever?
Matthew Farrell: Well, we doubled it, as you said, earlier in the year, and we do evaluate our uses of cash flow all the time. And the #1 destination for us is M&A. And as far as return of cash to shareholders, we've made one move with respect to doubling of dividend, and now we have decided we're going to address the share creep. But it is something that the management and the Board does address regularly. And I think at this point we wouldn't comment any further on our intentions.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then on detergents, I guess XTRA was up more than ARM & HAMMER this quarter. Should we expect that to continue to the rest of the year?
James Craigie: That's probably a pretty good assumption. And again, that's a good news bad news story. There's tremendous consumer appeal for our valued brands. And so when the ones -- the good news is XTRA has that tremendous growth and a record sales quarter in Q2. We expect that to continue be strong. The bad news on that, it's obviously a lower-margin product, so that affects some of the mix. But no, we think our value detergent business will continue to be very strong overall in the second half of the year.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: But you're expecting ARM & HAMMER alone, as a franchise, to also gain share or not?
Matthew Farrell: Yes. Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Gere of RBC Capital Markets.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I was just wondering if you could just talk maybe about the delta between the track and untracked channels, what you're seeing out there in terms of -- I know consumer demand is pretty bad out there, but can you talk a little bit about the difference between the 2 channels right now?
James Craigie: Well, first of all, the untracked channel is going to change a lot because Wal-Mart is going to become part of Nielsen shortly. So that'll be a huge -- so that was a wonderful move, to put a major competitor in there. The untracked channels are generally done very well. That's where the flow is towards the mass merchants and towards the dollar channels and some of the club. But I wouldn't say any major change in that over time. It's just their -- for a long time have flowed that way.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, as I'm just trying to think about the organic sales, and I appreciate the color that the consumer Domestic should see acceleration into the back half of the year with the spending. Can you just talk maybe about that 8 power brands versus the tail brands and then kind of how you're managing those tail brands right now? Like in the quarter, that 2%, how does it split between the 8 power brands and the tail brands? And do you see the tail brands starting to stabilize? How are you managing those businesses?
James Craigie: The bottom line of that one, Jason, is we always have put our focus more and more on the 8 power brands. They're all doing, like I said, we grew share of 5 out of the 8. We generally grow share on that 5, or 6 or 8 out of the 8. We put the focus there. The tail brands have done pretty well now. Matt mentioned earlier we intentionally, in the first half of this year, discontinued some bonus packs on our value toothpaste, which honestly were unprofitable and we took them out. And so that was part of reason our organic growth went down a little bit. And those brands lost some share, but it was a wise move for us terms of gross margin by getting rid of business that made no sense. Otherwise, our other tail brands are -- some are actually growing, doing well. This comes with our [ph] value base. But we manage those quite well, and the decline on those is very minor.
Matthew Farrell: Jason, this is Matt. Just to give you some -- a number. The value toothpaste that Jim made reference to, so Aim and Close-Up where we ended some unprofitable bogoes [ph], from a top line standpoint, that was a 30 basis point drag on our organic growth in the second quarter, but it was a conscious decision on our part.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay, and that drag should continue. I mean, I'm just trying to get a little perspective there.
Matthew Farrell: Actually, it was bigger in the first quarter. It's actually been tailing off, so it'll less of a factor in the second half, but it certainly affected the second quarter.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And just the last question. I think back at your meeting back in February for the year end. We were talking about SG&A, that this year, you were expecting to see some good SG&A leverage coming through. And I know there's been some legal costs and I'm sure there's probably some FX too. But when you look at the back half of the year, do you expect SG&A to get some leverage? Especially as the top line accelerates, you have some easier comps. And it sounds like the sales are a little bit second half weighted. So how should we be thinking about that?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, you're right about the legal costs, and those are things that are hard to predict and hard to forecast, so that is, as you would characterize, is a headwind. But we still -- since we have opportunity to get leverage on SG&A year-over-year but I wouldn't call a basis point number right now.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay, so that implies the second half should -- built into your guidance, is that there some improvement as a percent of sales in SG&A?
Matthew Farrell: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch: So just wanted to go back to the shelf space gains, right? You said in the power brands, you've been getting space, and I know that's been ongoing. But can you just talk more recently, I guess, about the trends and how much visibility do you have? Have shelf space gains accelerated and -- or distribution gains accelerated? And then, how much of that is coming from innovation versus what you think is just retailers emphasizing value products?
James Craigie: I don't quite know how to answer your question about acceleration. We actually put a chart out in a presentation recently at Wall Street, which indexed our distribution gains over the last several years, and I'd be glad to give you that afterwards. So -- and those are pretty much over for the most part of this year as far, because we usually cap it on the second quarter. And so we again had very good distribution gains across our 8 value, our 8 brands. To your point, it's probably innovation, and it's probably value. It's that our value brands have done very well. Our retailers are making smart moves to get more emphasis in the shelf for the value brands, so value brands like in XTRA and to some degree, ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent have achieved some of the share gains on the value proposition, but they've also had great new products. The XTRA with OxiClean has done well. The ARM & HAMMER for the sensitive skin has done well. So it's kind of a combination of both, Chris, but it's -- the bottom line, which was very good, is our new product innovation and our value-oriented portfolio have helped us to gain share almost across the board in all of power brands.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG: Matt, can you guys, can you just help me with the earnings other than now? Because sales were held the same, gross margin was brought down, you're going to keep the advertising level still in the same range. So how do you hold the guidance? And I know you said there's not a material change in the SG&A ratio, so is it lower interest and lower share count, is that the way to think about it?
Matthew Farrell: Well, I mean, our primarily levers when it comes to EPS are revenue, gross margin and SG&A. We would say marketing would be secondary because it's real important to how we drive the business. And revenue and gross margin are, certainly we got ranges in there. And SG&A, as I said to Jason before, we do see an opportunity to get some more leverage year-over-year on SG&A. And in the second half, of course, we have these new product launches that are also influencing factors. So we've got that built in as well in the success to Tooth Tunes, in particular, and that neti pot. So it's -- there are pieces, but we do see definitely a way home here for 10% to 11% EPS growth.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG: But is it more share repurchase driving at the point? Because I get all those things, but if you look at the guidance, you're still the 3% to 4%. The only change was the gross margin is worse than before.
Matthew Farrell: Now remember, we have a $0.03 range for the year, and the share repurchase at best would be $0.01. You're limited to what you can buy, and as I said, the run rate is 2 million shares a year, so even if we're to take [indiscernible] off the table, the best it would get you is around $0.01. So, I mean, that's not a big swinger.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, so the delta, I guess, is just better SG&A leverage? But I thought you said that's not going to be hugely -- You know what I mean? Because it's like, there's like a 50 basis point gap on the margin side, isn't there, with the sales the same?
Matthew Farrell: Well, it depends on where you come out with your top line, right?
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG: Yes, but that doesn't change, do you know what I mean?
Matthew Farrell: Yes, but where you're going to come out within the range, it's going to -- we haven't tightened it, so we weren't able -- we were going to tighten it to give you a better guidance, but we left it where it was.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, no, that's fair. And then just on gross margins side, would you'd want to quantify like how much of a drag the big specialty growth was in the quarter? Because I know mix has called out pretty aggressively. Was that primarily because the specialty business grew so much faster and maybe in the back half? I think you said you assumed it to slow a little bit and some of the consumer business were going to accelerate. Is that a big driver?
Matthew Farrell: It is a factor in the second quarter. But I wouldn't say it would be a big swinger for the full year just because I've said it. It'll tail off the whole dairy product spike in the second quarter. You're going to get a little bit more in the third quarter. But yes, specialty would influence this quarter, but it would be muted by the fact that you got 3 other quarters in the year.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, yes, that's great. And then one quick last one for Jim maybe. This dry shampoo acquisition, does this signal, like, a bigger portion to traditional personal care category? I know, like historically, you haven't really been big in, like, skin, and obviously the deodorant business has been a little bit tough recently. Does that change at all?
James Craigie: No, Bill, not honestly. It's just we're agnostic as to which way we go in household personal care and that, and this was just a great opportunity to personal care category, so we took. But no, it doesn't indicate any swing one way or the other.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays Capital.
Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital: I just wanted to first follow up on personal care sales. I'm just a little bit confused because sales were flat in the quarter. You talked -- I saw it in the press release it says that condoms were down, but then earlier, in an answer to your questions, you said condoms were up. We know that value toothpaste was up, and that Nair was good. So where was the softness in personal care this quarter?
James Craigie: As far as the different businesses within the personal care side, you mentioned right, we did lose some business. Matt quantified it when he told you the toothpaste.
Matthew Farrell: Yes, we had a good quarter, 6, somewhat offset the weakness in Trojan. With respect to Trojan, we said Trojan was lumpy. So up Q1, down Q2; but on the half, up, and also saying our prospects are good for the second half as well in the Trojan category.
Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital: Okay, so Trojan was really -- Trojan plus toothpaste, there really that -- it's simply that's what it is in terms of personal care in the quarter that was soft.
James Craigie: The Trojan was a quarterly shift, and the toothpaste was unintentional getting rid of profitable bogoes [ph].
Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital: Okay. Can you explain that, just the shift in Trojan for me? Just what was it that pulled sales into Q1?
Matthew Farrell: Well we had some accounts that reset in Q1 that normally would reset in Q2. And the other thing is we had a May price increase as a lesser factor, but you have a little bit small that swung into Q1 as early buy.
Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital: Okay, cool. And then for new product launch activity, and I might be misunderstanding, but I know that you guys highlighted your new products in the press release, but it sounds like some of the things like the sensitive laundry, the XTRA plus OxiClean -- have those launched yet, or are those still coming? Because I have -- maybe it's misunderstanding, but I thought they were more of a 2Q launch with the plan?
James Craigie: No, everything else is launched. The ones we mentioned were back half new launches on the Simply Saline neti pot items and on the Tooth Tunes. So everything else launched in Q2, and that's why we started to ramp up our marketing spending by over 200 basis points versus Q1. And we'll keep up and spend more dollars in the back half of the year. But those 2 are new ones, and especially we're really excited about this Tooth Tunes item. It's honestly an item, it's an item we bought from Hasbro company who launched it several years ago and delivered in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million in gross retail sales out there. They couldn't handle the product, the SKU complexity of the product. They couldn't handle the retailers that wasn't their normal retailers. And they discontinued the product. But it was a terrific product and we bought the rights to it. And we're relaunching it in a much, I think, smarter way in terms of fewer SKUs. We got some of the hottest artists out there, and the retail reaction so far has been phenomenal.
Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital: Okay, great. And then my final thing was, I thought it was -- Jim, when you mentioned working with non-competitive CPG companies to maybe consolidate purchasing, that -- really interesting. So anything you can share on that? How new is this? Is it something you're kind of starting now and hope to get some benefits in 2012? And just how broad is the work that you're doing?
James Craigie: It's new. I can't share with you who it is, but it's -- you can think we often talk to you about what our largest ingredients are, from things like corrugate and surfactants on that. And we're finding companies out there that we don't compete with that buy those materials from some of the same suppliers, and we're talking to them. And it'll have, begin to have some impact in 2012, but probably more after 2012. But it's a good move to create greater bursting [ph] leverage, so it will help us in the future on our gross margin.
Operator: Your last and final question comes from Lee First of Lincoln Shield [ph].
Unknown Analyst - : I have a question about the Simply Saline neti pot. Is that going to -- can you talk about the distribution for that? Would you be using like maybe similar or different from what -- where you are already?
James Craigie: No, it's very similar. It'll be out there in drugstores, mass merchants and very similar to every place we have Simply Saline today, which is in all type of accounts.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. Because it -- what about the natural foods or natural products channel, are you in there at all?
James Craigie: We do have few products in there, and that is an interesting opportunity for that channel. Thank you. We'll take a look at that. But mostly right now, we're going into our traditional channels, which are 98% of the volume in this country.
Operator: And there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?
James Craigie: No. I want to thank everybody for taking the time today to hear our call. Again, we're very happy with the first half, especially in this very, very tough business environment. And we feel very encouraged about the second half. Again, I told you, the month of July was an exceptional month for us. We're off to a strong start, and we certainly hope it continues. And we'll deliver the numbers we promised to you. So thank you very much, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-09 12:30:00) =====
Executives: Jim Craigie – Chairman & CEO Matt Farrell – EVP & CFO
Jim Craigie: Good afternoon. So then the entrée is here, but I want to thank you all for coming to our presentation today. Our timing is quite precipitous, you’d be in a foot of snow tomorrow, but we’ll guarantee to get you out of here before the snow starts hitting today. We have a very full agenda, I have a few opening remarks in a second, then Matt’s will be up here and give you some more color on the Q4 and tell the 2009 financials. I’ll let Matt give you some more details about the businesses in terms of share and what’s going on with our competition, and then I’ll tell you about our outlook in 2010, and then we’ll be glad to take any questions from the floor. If I were to say to you is, our business results reflect an organization that’s highly motivated and firing on all cylinders. Our product portfolio consisting of premium and value brands puts us in a position to thrive in any economy, as shown by our consistently strong EPS growth over the past 10 years. In the recessionary economy over the past year, our value brands, which are 40% of our portfolio have experienced exceptional growth. We spindly [ph] reinvested some of the profits from that into increased marketing spending in our premium brands, are having some exciting new products to drive share growth in those brands despite weakening consumer demand in many of our categories. Now on the cost side of our business, our supply team is working very closely with our business team to deliver exceptional gross margin expansion. We also kept a very tight rein on overhead costs, as proven by the fact that we have the same number of employees today as we had four years ago despite a 50% increase in sales during that time. And finally, we squeezed more dollars out of our working capital to drive a significant increase in our cash flow. That increased cash flow and a strong balance sheet has enabled us to smartly invest in our future through investments in our supply chain, such as the brand new laundry plant we just finished in York, Pennsylvania, that will further lower our cost structure and strengthen our future competitive advantage. All these factors make me feel very bullish about my company’s future despite the very tough – and I’d say toughening business environment we face going forward. In my bias opinion, no other consumer package this company, this is well suited to thrive in any type of business environment as Church & Dwight. We were delivering exceptional EPS growth before the recession. We are delivering exceptional EPS growth during the recession, and we are taking actions to ensure that we continue to deliver EPS growth going forward regardless of the future economic environment. Now before I go forward, let me just say, that was my opening remarks, that’s our pretty product line. Safe harbor statement, we are going to make forward-looking statements today that are based on best intentions and our best forecast, but, of course, they are based on factors that could be out our control. So, if you believe in anything we say today, proceed at your own risk. And with that I will now the turn the podium over to Matt who is going to come up here and provide greater insights on our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the total year.
Matt Farrell: Okay I am going to start with the fourth quarter. I am sure everybody has read the release. I think one thing is most remarkable about the third quarter is although we had 3% organic growth total company, that we had 5% organic growth for the total consumer. And of course the difference between our -- that is specialty products business and specialty products business had a really rugged 2009 and a very great 2008, and that took our organic growth rate from 5 to 3. Gross margins have been up all year long, so again 400 basis points in the fourth quarter, and operating margin up to 10. There is so -- some of the numbers, just a couple of things to point out here, you know that our model is such that when we expand gross margins we also spend back on our marketing – and we have seen marketing was up in the fourth quarter 120 basis points. Now this is the fifth consecutive quarter that we have put marketing into overdrive and Jim is going to talk about that a little bit later on what impact that is going to have on our 2010 call. Get down the page a little bit more SG&A. SG&A was a little bit high in the fourth quarter. Reasons for that is R&D, so we were up about $8 million year-over-year, and SG&A 92 going to $100 million. And $4 million of that was R&D, and we’ve got another 2.5 was FX. And you can see the rest, effective tax rate was up a little bit year-over-year and EPS up 26%. And in fourth quarter, five of our eight power brands grew share in the fourth quarter. As you know, we talk about our power brands all the time because its 80% of our revenues and profits. In 2008, we have eight out of eight group shares, and in the fourth quarter we had five out of eight, and I am going to show you the slide in a minute for the full year. Here is the full year number so EPS up 22%, and organic up 5% for the company and 7% for consumers, so that's domestic plus international combined up 7%. And I am going to show you chart in a minute that’s going to show you the breakout between the volume and price mix of that 7%. And remember the reason its five total company and 7% for consumer is because this is specialty products business drag. Gross margin is consistent with the fourth quarter, full year was up 430 basis points, and free cash flow was up to $339 million. That number by the way excludes our new plant. We had $85 million of spending on our new plant in York County, Pennsylvania. And we have set a legal settlement, which after-tax helped us by $12 million in 2009, that is also excluded from the 339. And here is just the numbers, if you roll down the page again, you could another appreciation for what our model is, is at 7% consumer growth. And, so that's the backdrop with a call for 2010, which is 5%. So now going down the page, you see marketing as a percentage of sales up 190 basis points, so it’s about half of the gross margin increase. Operating margin up 220, and again EPS and free cash flow up significantly year-over-year. And here is the slide I mentioned before, were as in the fourth quarter, we had 5 of 8, on a full year basis 7 of 8 power brands were up year-over-year and we have a similar objective for next year. Here is how the quarters work down in 2009, and you can see we were up double digits each of the quarters. The sell side analysts here are consumed with the quarterly numbers, we are not. We are more focused on the full year, but if you look at how this shake-out for 2009, reason in here is because 2010 is going to look just like this. So we expect our very first quarter to be our biggest quarter, and Jim is going to talk about that call in a few minutes. And here is the last three years, so the backdrop has been up 5, up 7 and up 5. This is organic growth total company. This is all in, but this is the backdrop for the 4 to 5% call up [ph] for 2010. And here is a little more detail, if you look at what are the components of the 5% total company growth in 2009, you see consumer in the far right is up 7%, but Specialty was down 11%. So that’s net down to 5%. And the highlighted number on this slide is volume. So consumer volume in 2009 was up 5%. Price mix helped despite to -- that’s how we got to seven, you don’t expect price to be up in 2010. But the important thing is volume; headed volume performance in 2009. So again, since 2010 is going to be more of a volume year than price, this also gives us a lot of confidence. And here is the gross margin history. You see 39.1 going to 44.8, since 2007, up 430 basis points in 2009. I will stop on this one. This is a little bridge. Where did the 430 basis points come from? So, we like, all CPG companies have the benefit of lower raw material prices in 2009. That helped us by 200 basis points in gross margin. We have a good to great program, which we talk about all the time. Now this is a program where we have hundreds of products that are directed towards improving the efficiencies within our company, and Europe contributed to gross margin expansion. And then price mix, we took lots of price up in the fourth quarter of 2008, and we got 130 basis points in that – help from that. And then let finally Orajel, we acquired Orajel in July of 2008, so we get a full year benefit of that in 2009 and that added 50 basis points. So that is the math to get to 430 year-over-year. Free cash flow, we’re very focused on free cash flow within the company. A 25% of our incentive comp is tied to free cash flow targets. And so our definition of free cash flow, by the way its operating cash minus CapEx. So we’ve just used base CapEx in this equation. That’s because we spent $50 million in 2008 and $85 million in 2009 on the new plant. So, the base CapEx is around $50 million, so we go $200 million, $280 million, $339 million. And free cash flow conversion again, that’s a comparison of free cash flow to your net income. Again, we are well over 100% into the last three years, and we’re targeting a similar result in 2010. And here’s the CapEx slide. So you can see 2007, '08, '09 base CapEx 49, 47, and 50, and you can see what we’ve spent on the new plant in 2008, it was 51 and an 85 in 2009. But we typically are around 2% to 2.5% of sales for CapEx. And looking ahead to next year, you may have noticed in our release that we’re doing an SAP upgrade within the company, we expect CapEx to be $60 million to $70 million in 2010. The lion’s share of that increase is the SAP implementation. And it is our balance sheet, you know, Jim talked a lot about our strong balance sheet. This is the reason why we are always in the hunt for new acquisition, and you can see we have been improving that markedly over the last couple of years. To give you some statistic we have about $450 million of cash in the balance sheet right now, and we have a $180 million of un-drawn lines and you can see our net debt-to-EBITDA is 0.7. So strong balance sheet, and I am going to add on this, why, here you know this company is totally focused on total shareholder return. These items here are in order deliberately. So number one is, TSR accretive acquisitions. The acquisitions we acquired something generally about every 18 to 24 months. So we bought Orajel in 2008; we bought Oxiclean in 2006. New product developments, and the biggest one there you have seen more recently is Arm & Hammer with Oxiclean. CapEx organic growth, obviously we spent a lot of money on that plant. Debt reduction, we were very vigilant about our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Our is target is 2:3, but we have been well above for a good period of time. And return to cash to shareholders, this is last on the list, but this is something that we on the board re-evaluate just about at every board meeting, but we have concluded that the best use of our cash is -- the number one use of our cash would be TSR accretive acquisition. And with that I am going to bring Jim back up.
Jim Craigie: Thanks, Matt. I will try to give you some insights on the business right now going forward. I would say of the insult [ph] when you asked about my competition in the Q&A. This is one of my favorite slide. I always want to show this, I mean, what a great we have. We are involved with 688 trillion choco-chip cookies. We have 7 billion gallons of milk coming from animal division business. We have 5 billion teeth brushings every year from our business. We have 740 million loads of laundry done with OxiClean, and $520 million sex act and they don’t necessarily happen in that order, but anyway, it’s a fun company to be involved with on everyday basis. We have over 80 brands in our company, but we have eight power brands, as we call them, they do 80% of our sales and profits. And that’s where we focus the bulk of our marketing spending, and our success heavily rides on those. And those brands are very premium brands and market leaders across the board, as you can see from that chart. Now this is the part, you always think its certain delight, you have to think of this. Our company is very unique. Nobody else that I know of had this kind of a portfolio. 40% value of our revenue base, 60% premium. Now, hey, okay you can us lucky, whatever you want to call us; in a recessionary economy value brands are thriving. And just I want to show you, what does that mean? That’s not $0.10, that’s a lot of money. In the laundry category, our biggest business, a very big driver where consumers constantly purchase. Here’s the index, if you look out, they are comparing the key brands in the marketplace. Tide, the most premium brand out here, you give that a 100 index, how does everything else compare? As you can see on this chart, ARM & HAMMER would be a 48 index to Tide, XTRA would be a 32 index to Tide, half to one-third the price of Tide. Now, I want to also make a point you’ve heard a lot about price declines out there recently by one our competitors. Shear and Era [ph] who have taken price declines on. Shear used to be a 100, it’s now at 86. Who cares? Era, usually about a 70, its now at 54, a little closer, a little more to worry about, but you're talking about a one and a half share brand, maybe two at its best day, a third of our size. So don’t get overly worked up about what's going on with the competition. We still have a significant price advantages in the marketplace, first, the bulk of our competitors, which is why our brands have done so well. Folks this is what's going on. It makes total sense, consumers have shifted from premium and mid-tier brands, the value brands. This is Neilson Homescan data from the marketplace. We didn’t make this up. It's straight from out there hardcore data. You can see the kind of shift going on in the premium brands and the mid-tier brands, the value and extreme value. Get this number. We have captured 90% of the growth in the value tier over the last year. Better yet, we have captured 80% of the liquid laundry growth in 2009 for the total category. We had a great year. People are coming to value. It makes total sense. It’s a recession folks, 70% of this country is unemployed. You are going to ask. I beat you at the question, “Hey Jim, is the economy recovering? Is this going to stick to the ribs, it’s going to flow back to mid tier and premium tiers.” I won’t answer the question; I will let two creditable sources to answer the question. Adage in May of this year did a whole study, whole point was -- consumers are now trading down. They are making smart choices in their own research. We had nothing to do with this. Based on pie they picked it out, god knows why. 90% of Tide [ph] users were trading down and they said 80% of those people are likely to keep trading down. Better yet, a little known consulting firm name McKenzie did a study in August and November of this year. Talk about the new normal for consumers. Two things they saw, two shifts going on. Changes in the ability to pay. Hey, no kidding, people don’t have as much money as they used to, and better yet changes in perception. And as a result of both shift this is a quote from McKenzie, “the majority of consumers plan they will stick with lower price brands.” What does that mean? Question, what about liquid laundry]? Well McKenzie did this study, gave these numbers across many categories. I will give you the ones on laundry, most important to us. McKenzie’s numbers 20% of consumers have traded down on laundry category. 48% of those consumers have better experience than they expected. Net 10% of the business they see shifting down in the business. We love that. We are the ones that are there waiting for it. Here is the other good news, not only our value detergents growing, but, that’s driving the growth of laundry out of this like OxiClean, Shower [ph] and things like that. That category is up 10% in 2009, and 55% of that growth is coming from the growth of value laundry buyers. Hey, why? That’s just not again being stupid, that's being very, very smart. If you take a value laundry detergent like our XTRA, it costs about $.065 a load. For a really, really tough stain, you can throw in a scoop of watery additive like OxiClean, costs about a $0.11 a load. For a total of $0.17 you can get the cleaning power of a premium detergent, which cost you 29% more. So really smart consumers are realizing they can get the same performance of a premium brand for almost 30% less by buying a value detergent and a laundry additive. And I told you many times before, for everyday sweat all you need is a detergent, you don’t need a laundry additive. For really tough stains, blood stains, grass stains then throw in the laundry additive or buy the premium brand but smart consumers are realizing, they can save significant dollars by buying a value detergent, and when necessary tossing in a scoop of a laundry additive. You guess what brand that benefit. Thank you. OxiClean, our number one brand in the laundry additive category. Our sales were up 16% last year, our shares up to a 38, almost up three points last year. Keep in mind we bought this business three years ago with a 26 share of market, we have grown that with our marketing power and sales power to a 38 share. You might also wonder somebody else entered this category this past year, and now you know why. That's our value business, value business has been doing great, let's talk about the premium side, the 50% of our business. We have smartly taken the growth we’ve had in the value side, taken some of that, taken some of the growth margin growth and put in the higher marketing dollars on our power brands. Why? You can always go back on the Graw-Hill the research few years ago, back in the 80s, the lastly recession, companies in this case we just held their marketing spending, didn’t cut it versus companies that cut it, did hugely better than the years after the recession ended. It makes total sense, research proves it. What have we done? This past year we increased our marketing spending by $60 million, and two years before that was up $77 million in total for a $137 million total over the last three years we invest in our business. What have done with that money? Well, look, we’ve done a lot of studies. In our eyes when you share a voice, you share the advertising, the category gets to an index of an 150 over your share market, it really drives your business ahead, results in share increases and we’ve shown all the categories we have done that in the past two years. What’s the results, okay this past year? Arm & Hammer and liquor laundry Trojan grew eight times faster than the category. Xtra grew six faster than the category. OxiClean two times faster than the category that had some good growth last year, I just told you. Arm & Hammer Clumping Cat Litter grew three times faster in the category. Condom, not too much growth, but we grew 1.5 times faster in the category, and I got a really good success story in that one coming up. SpinBrush, top category, premium toothbrush obtained at least six bucks as much as a 100 bucks for a toothbrush here. A category that was hurt last year in recession, we actually grew. Same thing with diagnostics, very expensive. Pregnancy kits cost anywhere from eight to twenty bucks, category actually suffered this past year; we grew because we increased the marketing spending in the category. So, across the broad our increased marketing investments is paying off. We are growing fast in the categories we are gaining share. In fact, if you look over the last three years over our eight power brands, so that’s 24 opportunities over three years, eight times three, we had been in the category growth 20 out of 24 times. I defy any other CPG company to show that chart for their power brands, I can’t believe those will even come close to that. Let me talk about 2010 for a minute. Business environment, though it’s going to be even tougher than 2009, you’ve got four things going on. You’ve got a minimal economy rebound. Do the numbers, there is going to be more unemployment over the course of 2010, even if it stays where it is right now, and then there wasn’t 2009 where it was building. So you got a rough economy. Two, you got companies spending more on trade spending. They are trying to buy their share back. As add to the fact there won't be any pricing in 2010, which help businesses out there. So no pricing and increased trade spending. Three, you got continue SKU rationalization. You saw the news the other day, as that was quite shocking but it's very typical, glad and hefty. We’re thrown out of the sandwich bag category in one of our major customers. If that big, it's not just a little guy, it’s just their pressure is across the board. And four, commodities which were favorable in the past year are a headwind. So you've got what’s in my mind is a much tougher business environment out there in 2010 than even 2009. Yet we will be very successful in that environment for all the reasons I’ve told you and more to come here. First, we have and I’m this is the best new product pipeline ever out there. We’re going to continue strong marketing support, we’re going to continue our gross margin improvement, and we’re positioned well for acquisitions, and I will tell you about each one of these here. The pipeline is great. Again the best I have ever seen. In laundry detergents, we’re launching what we called Power Gels, which has the new formula on the detergents, there is much more power in the cleaning of the laundry detergents going out there better than watery liquid. We will be launching shortly in our ARM & HAMMER line. On OxiClean, we have a whole line called Max Force, which gives you better stain fighting than ever before across the line, it will come in every form including the new little powder puck [ph] going out there. That’s unsuccessful for one of our competitors, so it's the very good, better cleaning line in OxiClean going out there. Condom, I know one fell off the podium here, hang on a second. This is so hot I can't stand still here. This story, the condom business is on fire literally, but the second quarter of last year we launch Ecstasy which is the new shape condom, more sensitive. This is already in six months the number one selling condom in America. It's the best new product launch we ever had. In fact, we couldn’t keep up with demand on this until late in the fourth quarter of this year. We are finally catching up with demand for this product. We are going to -- that success is going to ride in 2010. On top of that we are about to launch a new product call Fire and Ice. If you see the lubricant category, it has been very successful for KY Jelly with kind of leveraging kind of off that idea with our own version of it. It’s got very interesting lubricant for both the inside and the outside of the condom, a very unique experience. So literally this business is going to be on fire. We just hit an all-time record share in this four weeks for almost 77. I am optimistic that this business is going to get at 80 a share in 2010 based on the success of these two new products. SpinBrush, the number one battery toothbrush for the past 17 quarters. We had a huge success in 2009. We launched Sonic battery powered SpinBrush. Sonic SpinBrush has been much faster than a normal spin brush would. Better cleaning power out of it. Highly successful, the fastest growing brush in the category. Just in this past month it has got a best five rating by top consumer magazine. I am not allowed to say their name, but you think who is the top consumer magazine out there. It just got a Best Buy of all toothbrushes out there in, which is their top rating. We are leveraging successful launching every chargeable version of that out there. In 2010, since you got all the benefit of rechargeable brushes out there at about 55% lower costs. So, great technology at a low cost, had a great success in driving our SpinBrush business again. We were one of the only guys in the whole toothbrush category who were up last year in a down overall category. First Response, this is a business again, had a tough year last year. If you know the history of pregnancy, kit everyday sooner you can get a reading before the missed period counts. When the world has four days, begin then with five days, big jump in the business. We were the first guys coming out with the Test [ph] Flow Read six days before the missed periods. A date doesn’t sound like much, but if you are pregnant or you don’t want to be pregnant, that day is an eternity. And with the first folks out there with it is just launching at the marketplace, and then last year was so rising success, we launched our fertility test kit out in the marketplace, its been very successful. So big new news on FIRST RESPONSE. Last but not least there, we had great success last year with a brand called product – a called Shower Power, about 90% of women love to shave their legs in the shower until that product is launched you couldn’t use a (inaudible) it washed up before it had its effect. With this product you could actually apply to your leg, go and take a shower, in the shower it’s great but it also have all the benefits of (inaudible) which takes the hair off right at the skin whereas a razor or blade leaves nubs (inaudible) and it lasts twice as long as shaving. So we hit that last year, we are launching in a new form this year with a pump, again and continue good success for that business. And there is more to come. We have one or more major product innovation to launch in the back of the year, I can't tell you what it is, I don’t what to you tip off the competition but it is big and you'll hear about it as soon as this is ready – as soon as we announce it to the trade. Strong marketing support, what I will tell you on this, we're going to be 14% plus or minus of sales. Again we went up a 190 basis points from the last year, an extra 60 million in spending. We will be in that neighborhood in 2010, very strong levels. And keep in mind, our share of voice that will give us share of voice greater than share of market in almost everyone of our segment, and not just slightly bigger but way bigger. So again, we're going have that share of voice out there with that kind of starting to continue to drive share gains in the marketplace. Again, as Matt showed you before, four to five I think I’m a little surprise, some of you look at it like, that’s like something new for us. That’s not new for us at all. We've done 5-7-5 in last two years. In fact in 2009, as Matt told you, the consumer business, which is 90% of our business did 7. So actually we're stepping down a little bit to 4 to 5, an SPD, which was a drag last year is no longer a drag. The milk market has come back around and SPD there will be a growth by this year. So we feel very comfortable coming out with the number that you might think is pretty aggressive, but again our history says that not aggressive and we feel very comfortable coming out in a tough environment with our great new product pipeline, and with our marketing support. And I am sorry, I have to brag a little bit. I have already -- we’re going to have our first billion dollar brand. Arm & Hammer will cross a billion dollars in 2010. I know some of our competitors have 21 or 22 or 23 of those, but we have our first one. We are crossing one of the big leagues and this one we’re very proud of it, that this brand continues to grow. Gross margin improvement, it’s going to continue. If you look at what’s going on with gross margin interest, and we’ve got a new laundry plan that we have been bragging about. We just commissioned it couple of weeks ago and it’s incredible. New York, Pennsylvania, if anyone (inaudible) visit it, we will set up a date and go see it. I have seen a lot plans in my time but never seen a plan as incredible as this plan. We are pumping out laundry bottles like crazy. It came out ahead of schedule and ahead of budget. It’s going to deliver significant savings to us, and keep in mind this is our biggest business laundry. So it’s very important. Cost savings from the good to great program. Our crony [ph] name is going to continue, lots of various projects going on of our businesses to save money. But three headwinds, raw materials, which were up favorably, coming into this year, we think, are going to drag on the year. Trade spending, hey, you are reading about it. We have seen it out there. Competitors are spending more in the trade line to try to win back their business, and business mix, not that’s kind of funny one. As PDS [ph] is going to have volume growth but because its margin is lower, it will be a slight drag in our gross margin. Net-net, we are going to be up on gross margin. We always target about a 100 basis points. We did a 100 the prior four years up until 2009. We did that over 400 in 2009 itself. We are targeting a 100 basis points. It will be plus or minus. If things go on that can be out there with promotional spending, we will react to it. We are not going to let anybody have an advantage from us. So we will be in that ballpark. A little early in the year to call exactly, it will definitely be up. It will be about that range whether it’s a little less or a little more, wait till you see what happens. That’s a picture of our new plant, 1.1 million square feet our New York, Pennsylvania. Incredible facility, over 200 trucks a day goes flowing out of there with products. It’s just an unbelievable automation, and this has been going on, and it gives us ability to compete even more effectively in the laundry business going forward, and it helped continue to drive our gross margins up. And it all ends up with continue strong EPS growth. At this point in time we are coming a little bit aggressive at 13 to 15% so you can honestly see that's not unusual for us in that past, having done 19, 16 and 22. I would tell you, just try to put together your pro formas. Put four to five on the top line, put 13 to 15 in the bottom line, you figure out the rest in between, things will flow around, I’ll guarantee you those two numbers. And finally we’ll position for acquisition. (inaudible) was sitting on $450 million in cash, we have $180 million in undrawn facilities, our debt to EBITDA is very low, and we got $300 million more of cash flow coming in this year. So we are actively working on that. You can’t account them till you find the papers. There is opportunities out there, which nobody know what happens until the day come, so we are well-positioned for that, as matt said to you, we had a great history here. Now keep in mind, we are not going to buy junk, we are not going to overpay for anything premium. We want businesses that have primarily number one or two share brands. We want higher growth, higher margin brands, want asset life, I don’t want plants, I don’t want headquarters, we want to just totally integrate into our current business, leverage that capital base of ours with manufacturing, with just some purchasing and deliver sustainable competitive advantages. And we’ve had a great track record. This chart shows our track record since the year 2000. You’ve heard us say before, we have eight power brands that do 80% of revenues and profits. We acquired seven of those in the past ten years. We hope to add to that going forward to buy another and another power brand add to our portfolio, that stick to dynamics I just told you. So, we are working on it. I do think the M&A market is heating up, it’s good or bad, there is now because of the capital markets have opened up, people who wanted to sell are now going out to try to sell. I will tell you the competition is a little fiercer. I think a lot of other companies who don’t have the organic we have, are seeing acquisitions as the only way they can drive EPS accretion on the bottom line. So I think you’ll some more competition out there, so again. We are actively working on it. We are well positioned for it. We are in a great position money wise, and we hope it happens this year. However, we make it perfectly clear, all the numbers I quoted to you, 4 to 5 and 13 to 15 EPS, there is nothing built in there for acquisitions and there is nothing built in there right now for any use of our cash other than its sitting in the bank. Okay. And I guarantee you over the course of this year, if we don’t make an acquisition we are not going to sit with money in the bank. So, whether we buyback stock or do something we will figure that out. But right now we are actively working on some acquisitions. We are keeping our powder dry and if they don’t happen some time this year, we are likely to take some action with our cash, but right now we prefer to find a next-great acquisition to add to our power brands out there. First quarter, a little guidance for you, organic about 5% and EPS, as Matt told you, the first quarter historically is our strongest quarter. So don’t get funny on me, I would say take your calculator or take your brain out, do four times this is 420 to 440, you only call four bucks. So it’s about three time of four bucks Jim. Now, it’s always our strongest quarter. Don’t go crazy on it, we are telling you right now, we think we will be in that range and then we will come down a little bit off over the other quarters like we do in every year. That’s about it. We’ll be glad to open the floor now and Matt will do our best for Q&A, but I would just tell I feel great about our business. We are in great shape. We just had another great year, but it’s going to be tough. It’s going to be even tougher than ever out there in 2010 given the economic environment that all companies are facing. But again I think we are well positioned if not the best positioned to take advantage of it because of our unique portfolio, because our great new product pipeline, because of our increased marketing spending. We have been spending out there, and I think it will continue to pay off but it will be tough. But take the numbers that I gave you and put them in the bank.
Unidentified Analyst: (inaudible).
Jim Craigie: It will be the largest driver of the gross margin. I won't give you the number.
Unidentified Analyst: (inaudible).
Jim Craigie: In fact no. No. No. It will be big, I don’t want to quantity. The plant actually came up a little faster than we scheduled so we got little benefit and little tiny benefit in 2009, but still the bulk is coming in 2010.
Unidentified Analyst: (inaudible).
Jim Craigie: But we have other cost saving projects too, that we have a whole slew of other stuff going on with the cost saving. That plant by far will be the biggest benefit to it. There is other positive benefit and there’s some drags. So, your netted out will be in the ballpark of a 100 but I can't, I don’t want to get in the quantifying the exact, everyone of those go on. As we go through the quarters of the year, you’ll watch because, otherwise how do I, promotion activity by competition. It changes everyday. I get news on that. I have to react to it. That’s a drag. Commodity, I mean, look at oil, oils are popping up and down like the cork out there in the ocean, as we hear things going on foreign government. So there is a lot of balls in the air right now juggling. I think we know enough about our capabilities in this plant. We feel comfortable saying target around 100 could come in a little less, could come in a little more, should be confident enough to give to that ballpark right now but if there is probably more balls in the air right now than there had ever been in any year right now. Thank god we have new plant, we’re very happy. I would tell you too, I should have seven [ph] I mentioned that plant, that plant has space to integrate other businesses, and we already have one project of bringing another business to that plant, to be able to generate savings more in 2011. And we have land next to that plant, with that plant we could expand that plant another 50%. So this is our new super plant that’s going to help us not only this year, but in future years, drive future gross margin improvement and already actions are on way to do that for years to come. So, it was a big new thing. It was big at almost -- we talked about as an acquisition. It was $150 million, we sunk [ph] it into ground at New York, Pennsylvania and is having the kind of benefits that an acquisition would have to us, so but I will not give you a number.
Unidentified Analyst: Two questions, I guess, can you talk a little bit more about the commodity front where we spend a day, typically you do some hedging on food buying, okay where you are lot gaining and where are you more exposed? And then also, I know in the past on acquisition you said you don’t care whether it’s personal care or household, a lot in terms of value versus premium, is there a strong then after going through these past two years? maybe you like that more exposure beyond limited laundry and pregnancy kits in terms of being value exposed?
Jim Craigie: I will take the second one first, and let Matt answer the one on commodity hedging. We are agnostic between household and personal care. I would tell you we probably -- we actually prefer more premium than value a side, not that I would look at the value business, but I already feel we have very strong value side of the equation and lot of the categories, I mean, we have again value laundry. We have value toothpaste, we have value pregnancy kits out there. So we already have had a good value side. I don’t think I would buy into a large value-based business out there at this point. I would be much more prone to buy premiums. I don’t feel that we want higher margin, higher growth. So that’s kind of where our heads are on buying more premium power brands out there. Matt, on the hedging?
Matt Farrell: Yes, with respect to our commodity you probably know that the other big ones for us would be resins, surfactants and we have things like fatty acids distillates, latex, diesel and the paper. Every one of those is right now is up. Some as much as 7% year-over-year. We have hedged, we have physical hedges, and we also have some financial hedges, financial hedge is typically on diesel. So right now we have 25% of our diesel need, that’s locked in for next year. And for, remember the other ones we have even higher locked in for physical hedges in our contract. So we acted a little bit earlier with respect to 2010 and its going to payoff for us and you can see that on our clause [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: For 2009, I guess it was more share gain than category growth given destocking, can you just talk a little bit about the four to five, what are you assuming in terms of share gains, maybe the planogram reset that are out there or, and then on the same context, category growth you see there is really more second half weighted or do you think the innovations that you're seeing from your competitors is going to try and get people to start spending again?
Matt Farrell: Yes, let me try to answer that book. If you look at 2009, at just FDMX excluding the big (inaudible) Wal-Mart, only six of our categories showed dollar growth, only one of our categories had unit growth, pretty scary. That’s’ pretty typical what's going on out there. Now think for 2010, there is no pricing by anybody, anywhere on those. So pricing, which benefited dollar growth in 2009 isn't there for 2010. So 2010 to me is the year of units and some of you have been very live and said that in your reports. It's all about unit growth next year, so it’s all going to be about. If you want to gain – grow revenue, you got to grow your share. And I think you'll see companies realizing that and getting more aggressive on the promotion side, because they are not going to be layback and take price increases and have the price increase flow through, they’re dealing with an economy where people are trading down and actually honestly buying less as shown by the unit growth in 2009. So I don’t see that getting better as far as first half second half. I mean I don’t - I just think overall the year is going to be a pretty sucky year, as far as that’s a technical economic term. That’s as far as, if you are counting on dollar growth, your category, you better have a pretty good reason for it. It’s going to be unit growth here. It’s going to be a share reward year. And the company is out -- therefore how do you win that great new products, increased marketing support whether it's on the ad line preferably, or on the trade line, if you have to. And you better be out there battling for it. It’s going to be tough. Any one can get the retailers get in tough on SKU consolidation. It’s a really tough environment. So what I think again, we didn’t wake up yesterday. We invested in the marketing. We just saw over the last three years a lot in this past year pipeline, new product pipeline has been pumped up. I wouldn’t be this, you know me, I am usually conservative. At the start of the year I wouldn’t be this bulls man at the door if I didn’t feel good about it. I feel good about it, that you mentioned distribution, I am not going to talk accounts at all, but I would just tell you so far it’s positive for us. What we know about shell set, we plan out there. So again I feel good about that. You know we had some blips last year that we had to deal with. So far, no blips this year and so far the shell sets that we have been told about is positive for us. So that’s good for us going forward because he owns the shelf -- would generally does well in the share side. So a bit tough -- it's going to be a tough, tough, year.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, hi. In this morning’ release there was a remark about a decrease in trade spending being behind the decelerating growth in laundry? And I was just wondering if you can comment quickly on any other reason either competitive or environmental, that might have been behind that and secondly something you guys, maybe don’t talk about as much as any differences you see in a performance Xtra versus Arm & Hammer brand in that category?
Jim Craigie: Right. No, what happened was -- as you know we were starting up our new plant in New York, Pennsylvania in the fourth quarter and shutting down our plant in New Jersey. We didn’t want to flag to the world but we are literally taking lines out of one plant and switching into the next plant. We were concerned, we had great schedules, great people working on it, and in the end it all come up ahead of schedule, we were concerned that if there were any blips we wouldn’t able to supply merchandising setup to our customers. And the last thing I want to do is upset a customer by having them setup a promotion and you can't supply it. So we intentionally pulled back a little on laundry merchandising in the Q4 this year. We didn’t want to sell anybody that because competitors will take advantage of it. We pulled back a little bit, and of course it had an unfavorable impact on our volumes in the fourth quarter. The plant came up actually a little ahead of time, ahead of speed, producing great. We've restored all of our promotional spending on the laundry business, and I think especially as you see the first quarter come along, you will see us comeback very strong in the laundry side of the world. So that's what that was all about. It was an intentional move to avoid any out of stock risk, in case our new plant had blip starting up. They didn’t happen but we want to be cautious because we didn’t want to offset customers because we have been doing so great in the business. They’ve been big supporters of us and so we didn’t want to short them on any supply going out there. So, that's everything back up to speed and doing great. And XTRA versus – no, XTRA and Arm & Hammer, they both doing fine. Again we pulled back somewhat possibly a little different than the two. I don’t really want to get into details of that, but you saw the value advantages, XTRA’s you can't get better value in the marketplace than XTRA and Arm & Hammer’s. They are doing great, and the new Power Gel line and Arm & Hammer is getting us increased distribution out there, which I think will lead to a terrific year on Arm & Hammer and XTRA continued to do fine with this huge pricing again that’s out there. Connie?
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, I have two questions. First, can you describe a little bit more about the SAP implementation, you called it both an implementation and an upgrade. So, I forget if you already on this, but if you are what the upgrade and if you are not could you talk about the timing now versus some years ago?
Matt Farrell: Yes, thanking for asking that. We already are on SAP, what we are doing is a major upgrade across the world on that. It will be lot of work behind the scenes in 2010. It will have -- it will not start up until some time in 2011. So, I know one of our competitors has reported some blips on that thing, but there is no way that project will have any impact on 2010 because none of the work will actually go into implementation during 2010. It’s more 2011. And so just to enable us, we honestly consider one of our great advantages is we speed the market, and right now our systems don’t talk to us especially world wide as quickly as wish they would in getting data in-house and this will be an upgrade to increase the speed and the depth of knowledge out of our systems today. Actually should minimize any kind of issues we have some times on volume forecasting, getting the bill of materials collect the plans, and things like that. So, our systems were a little old and antiquated, and now we are bringing them up to life just like we built a new plant that gives us the state-of-the-art plant, so, but nothing, nothing will impact 2010.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and then secondly, on the quarterly flow of earnings, the reason that the first quarter’s growth is so high, does it have something to do with the timing of shipments, so you ship a lot in the first quarter and advertising doesn’t start till later on?
Matt Farrell: Yes, kind of, sort of -- the first quarter, one of the anomalies in the first quarter is when our quarter ends, so last year it ended on March 27th. This year it ends on April 2nd. So it’s a number of days in the quarter is an influencing factor as well on top line and bottom line. That’s one. The second thing is obviously is the marketing spend, and of course, our lowest quarter for marketing. And the third thing would be timing of the shipments. We have less new products going on sort of some pipe in Q1 and also Q2, so it’s a question of when they go out of the door. That may be we have plans for that, but sometimes that can shift between Q1 and Q2.
Unidentified Analyst: Just one more question on the flow of earnings. In the way you've mapped out your budget for this year given what would look like tough comps for Q2 through Q4, are you budgeting for any other quarters to decline?
Matt Farrell: Yes, there is kind of flip side to this. Just as Q1 is a longer quarter. Q4 is the shortest quarter. So that’s one of the reasons why Q4 year-over-year would be have tougher.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Matt Farrell: Yep.
Unidentified Analyst: First question is on the international business, and where that fits, particularly looking into 2010 and beyond in terms of the acquisition priority list, if you will? And then second question is on laundry compaction, do you think there is another wave coming and if so how far out is that?
Jim Craigie: Yes, our international business is actually gets stronger over the course of the year. We’re particularly doing very well in Canada, Australia, Brazil’s had a nice quarter. We’re doing a nice job of building our laundry business in Canada in particular. And got a lot of new gains up there in distribution and merchandizing, so we were very happy with that. As far as acquisitions on that, again we are agnostic. I love to go to the international business, about 17% of our total business right now. But I am not going to intentionally go out there and only say the first priority is international business is – we generally whenever we done acquisitions, part of the acquisition pickup has been international, sometime more, sometime less but honestly we’re still largely in North American business, there is no joke about that. But if I found a great business outside and met the criteria (inaudible) I’d buy it. That’s got to meet those criteria, I am not just going to buy to grow Western Europe or to grow Asia, just buy anything out there. So what's the second part of your question? Oh, compaction, laundry compaction. I believe one of our competitors has announced compaction coming in the powdered side of the world. Thank you, we like that. We will be glad to follow that. On the liquid side of the world it's possible. It’s little more difficult for some of our competitor because of the composition of their products. I believe they are smart enough to figure around that, and I believe at some point in time in the future you will probably see one more -- at least one more compaction of the liquid side of the world. There is still lot of water in the bottles and there is no need for that especially in this sustainability environment. So, but -- as in the past nobody wants to leave that because smaller bottles generally means, consumers do that as being cheated. So, as in the past action one of the key retailers draw their -- in the same timeframe, we all followed, it was terrific. We all liked it, consumer has one. They are going to carry home less. Retailers won. They could save money on shipping. We won, less plastic, less shipping for us. So it was a win, win, win, but it has to be coordinated across the industry and that’s very possible, and if that happens we will be very glad to follow that too.
Unidentified Analyst: Just coming back to laundry, you talked about not being overly concerned about Era [ph] and Cheer [ph], how you scenario plan around talk to you perhaps doing something more aggrieve with types? Would your price US just to be modeled look like it was threshold of price reduction they have to do to really move the needle against you guys?
Matt Farrell: There is again, they are 100 and we are about 48 and 32. Obviously, if they do as they have been doing more aggressive stuff on laundry, there is some impact. But we are still so far away from -- they have always, you are going to have more impact on the mid-price tier which they have had for a long time, which is why the mid-price tier has suffered the most over the past 10 years. So, I am not to say I don’t watch what they do. I have the highest respect for that company since I recognized their marketing power. I live everyday thinking about them, and what they do? I don’t see to them, I think our results speak for themselves as far as in the market place. And I think in the laundry side we have had such a huge advantage in pricing and we have been very aggressive on our new product activity.  I feel pretty good. So we watch them, I’m a little distressed, not distress, but couldn’t believe this past weekend they ran to buy ‘one get one free’ coupon on their number one brand, it speaks for itself. I guess they are feeling some pressure, but I think we're well positioned. I’m very, again our new Power Gel line, I think is going to do terrific, it’s gained incremental distribution, we got great marketing plans behind it. Consumers want value, McKenzie, AdAge, all tell you consumers are trading down and realizing what a great experience it is, and going to stick with it. So, I feel good but trust me I watch all competitors, especially them.
Unidentified Analyst: And just a quick one on the financial leverage side, maybe clearly not building in much of anything into the model this year. How should we think about financial leverage as the contributed earnings growth looking into 2011?
Jim Craigie: Well, I'll let Matt say too. But I think you are always going to find us, we're always going to be M&A oriented as far as looking for accretive acquisitions. We usually buy one every 18 months and then pay it off over the next 18 months, and then we are ready to buy again, depending on the size of it. But that’s always going to be our first priority.
Unidentified Analyst: And so you try to get at interest expense?
Matt Farrell: It's (inaudible).
Jim Craigie: Okay, we wouldn’t be public on that.
Unidentified Participant: Who is that side, Goldman Sachs?
Unidentified Analyst: That’s right. What are doing on those retained earnings?
Matt Farrell: Staying on, well, really talking about pricing, I guess the assumption here is that pricing is neutral in 2010 and we've already seen
Unidentified Analyst: Well, neutral from the price increase line, I wouldn’t say its neutral from a promotion line, but go ahead.
Matt Farrell: Well, that’s what I'm getting at, is we're probably going to see negative pricing in laundry detergents, that’s already started to happen in the category. So I just wondered if assuming to follow and have to do more aggressive pricing in laundry detergents, where would you offset that?
Matt Farrell: Yes, it's all built into our gross margin expectations. We do expect there will be some additional promotional activity across laundry or maybe across some other categories too. But that’s why we have built some of that thinking already into our gross margin assumptions and that’s why we keep saying to you, thank god again for this new plant. We somewhat -- I wouldn’t say we saw this coming, but we always knew we wanted to do something to help the margin laundry side and because of that other cost savings we will be able to afford. There will be a limit to which we can afford and there will be a limit which we’ll cut into gross margin, but I don’t know I am fearful. I am fearful folks who have lost share out there may do stupid things, excuse me, on the promotion side. I will not let anybody have an advantage from us. We fought too hard to get to where we are. We have the capability to fight full force and we will. That may have somewhat of impact on gross margin, but I think we have some of the other things in our -- wicker on this one. And don’t forget we have increased marketing a ton. If I had to shade that a little bit to deal with competitive activities and our promotion, I will, and still have share -- the share market advantages out there because we are so high above that rate now. But I hope sanity rules the day here, but if not, I am not going to be the one less standing behind watching my shares erode.
Unidentified Analyst: But even if you don’t take a list price reduction, the kind of promotions you are talking about, will come off the top line, wouldn’t they?
Matt Farrell: Yes, our trade spending -- comes out of the gross margin lines and they are.
Jim Craigie:
 :
Unidentified Analyst: When we say 45% top line, we have baked into that an expectation that this is going to higher trader spends. So just remember if there is a gross margin we say that’s a negative to gross margin year-over-year. We have also baked into the call of 4% to 5% top-line, so we thought about it.
Unidentified Analyst: So do you think volumes could be more like 7% to 8%?
Matt Farrell: No, I am not going to call volume number.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Matt Farrell: But Doug, I do think if you watched, I mean we, yes, the liquid laundry is our biggest business that you just saw on the fourth quarter where we intentionally pulled back, and it wasn’t a big grower for us, our premium of those businesses is just fantastic. We had terrific quarter around things like cat litter and condoms and other businesses. Matter of fact our personal care portfolio had very strong performance, and we even got brands like little Old Aim [ph] double-digit some things like that a value toothpaste doing good so. Liquid laundry is our biggest one. It's very important to us but Church & Dwight is much more than liquid laundry detergent, I think we’re proving that with the results returning in right now because we have invested. And now we got great new products, we’ve had and we are going to continue to have great new products, so liquid laundry will always be number one in my head but it's not the only one. And we’ve got a whole portfolio working to our advantage right now.
Unidentified Analyst: (inaudible).
Jim Craigie: Especially by stepping will the better, and that's my cow experts, I let him talk about this for a second so.
Matt Farrell: I have been prepping for this one all morning. Actually, some of you know that I did spend four, five years in the chemical business once upon a time. So specialty products, half of that business, both chemicals half of is animal nutrition. So the business it’s been dragged down, it's animal nutrition and that's tied to dairy. So the Soy with respect to animal nutrition is that there are way too many cows out there so there an oversupply, and the price of milk is plummeted in 2009. So, the way to think about it is the price of milk in ’08 was about $17.30 per 100 grade, that's a 100 pounds milk. Last year it was like 11 in the quarter. So it’s just way down, and now the future’s right now the average for 2010 is about $15. So, dairy farm, as you are going to start getting help there in 2010 and that’s good news for us, because do you remember the slides we looked at earlier, our SPG was such a huge drag for us year-over-year. We no longer have that drag. So when we look at 4% to 5% for next year that means domestic, international and specialty products business are all going to be pulling on a rope. So that’s going to be a healthier business. First quarter is probably going to be flat up on the top line and then thereafter you are going to see organic growth quarter-over-quarter in quarters two, three and four. I would also tell we are working some exciting new adventures in the specialty products group, I can’t say anymore about it now, but I hope over the course of 2010 we’ll tell you some new things we are doing that business to help drive growth in that business in the future, some very exciting stuff.
Unidentified Analyst: So you guys, beside the press release some investment that you are making in 2010, is most of that capitalized or is there some S&A implication running through the P&L?
Jim Craigie: Call me and I will get back up here. – Yes, Chris, say that first part of that again?
Unidentified Analyst: With the investments that you guys had, I guess it’s mostly SAP or maybe it’s not I mean, (inaudible) bright side of that, you know, some investments in 2010.
Jim Craigie: Yes, the SAP upgrade, think about it, round numbers is about 15 a CapEx and about $45 million of expense. And you’re right it’s not always all CapEx, so that’s how we are going to be picking up and mostly SG&A.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. And I know, I guess, in the environment you are facing now that it doesn’t seem like I know Jim you are saying that. You are saying there is no pricing out there?
Jim Craigie: (inaudible) yes exactly.
Unidentified Analyst: So what is it (inaudible) doesn’t seem likely now, I know there is no pricing out there at all. But commodities were to continue to run off, I mean, is it possible that the entire category has a real tough year, or do you think you would see promo ease a little bit of commodities were to just continue to move upward?
Jim Craigie: Great question. I think what you would expect to see us promotions ease up first, because there is more spending going into the marketplace on promotion. I think you’d see people pull that back. I think you’d see pricing second. I have a sense so that the big guy in Eatonville [ph] is not going to be take kind to any kind of pricing unless it was really out of this world. That’s just a guess. And so I would think promotional spending would come back first, and yeah we’re count on anything on pricing up as far as in 2010. And we think there will be some pressure from promotion side down as we are already seeing in the marketplace. And we’ve already baked into our plans whether there is more getable deal and if there is more, we’re not going to lead it, but we’re not going to lag it if it happens. Alice.
Unidentified Analyst: (inaudible).
Jim Craigie: Yes, it’s been a pretty volatile marketplace, the upfront had certainly declined in the double-digit range of your side. And then as always happens in the ad market its supply demand is crazy. Some players came into the marketplace like that kindles in that who would never bid even players in the outstanding rate and came in and sucked up a lot of spot very quickly in Q4 and somewhat in Q1. And when everybody thought, the week upfront that the spot market could be weak just the opposite happens, at least short-term, the spot rates have sky rocketed. So, and it's even hard at this point to buy spots, it was hard in Q4 and somewhat still in Q1. Well that will continue its supply demand coming up but it was always that way in prior years. It's not the Olympics through there, but I think it seemed the Olympics stuff hasn’t been that bigger news because the winter Olympics right now, so right now it’s still getting benefits versus prior year’s overall with the upfront by -- but it’s just weird, it’s you know, again this was an unexpected jump in the market place by some West Coast players with their new electronic stuff which drove up spot rates, whether they continue that or not we will see. But I think generally you are going to see some savings on the media side of the world from the rate, but that could change.
Unidentified Analyst: In the fourth quarter you have commented R&D was up $4 million year-over-year, was that a specific project or was that part of your plan to spend that you are -- I mean was that a one offer you were expecting?
Jim Craigie: It’s a bunch just out there. We just have the opportunity. There are a bunch of projects to invest in, have the money so we let it loose some. Those projects will be helping us more in 2011 and that.
Unidentified Analyst:
 :
Jim Craigie: On your first one, we are still in the Camp (inaudible) more. I believe, I will recall my staff about two years ago we launched about 50 plus new products. This past year 2009 we did about 35, will be in that same ballpark this year. We are literally trying harder and harder every day to only launch stuff which is truly going to have a meaningful impact on the business. No more ideas. There are just a couple of million dollars. We are looking for stuff that’s at least, what you call eight digits, type impact on the business. So we are just doing that. And I feel a lot of the projects, I talked about today almost saw on their camp. And what was your second part of your question?
Unidentified Analyst: (inaudible).
Jim Craigie: I couldn’t give you the answer for that. We definitely believe we're going to get gain from shelf space and we definitely gain from new products out there. Like I said shelf space so far, and the thing about shelf stage you have to understand is the world is no longer once a year resets. Almost all the retailers out there are trying to find the best answer to drive growth, they are struggling. And so if they do a reset and it works great and if they don’t they’re thinking and on the fly. So nothing said in stone for a year anymore. Right now what we know is a plus and we are happy. Second half of the year things may change and the retailers says I certainly then could have drove them I can to stay in the positive side of the equation, I think our new product pipeline will do that but you never know. And then for new products, again I told you, I think for the best new product pipeline ever, I’m thrilled with this new products pipeline, these are winners across the board. The TROJAN stuff is awesome, FIRST RESPONSE, we've been working, I can how many years we've been working to get that six day claim. It’s a very tough thing to get through the FDA, and has taken us years to get there improve that to, I mean we got it. That was huge, the SpinBrush leveraging the Sonic thing which was a big winner last year, was great. We actually had a positive year on the toothpaste business, the whitening booster which was over here was a big winner for us. I think it’s all in your bags, in the 30 bags we have here today. Again the laundry stuff, Power Gel line is huge, the Max Force line and OxiClean is huge, and then, that is too great. Everyone of those, that my new products team which went into effect in 2005 just keeps getting better and better and better, and we're putting the money there to the R&D side, and we are forcing them to kill the little puppies and focus on the big stuff, and its really paying off better every year.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a quick one on the Q1 organic growth rate. What's the impact of six extra shipping days in the quarter? I mean if you do the straight math on that, it looks like your guiding to no organic growth, which I know wasn’t the case, so I just want to make sure I understand that right.
Matt Farrell: We won’t know until we get there. The quarter ends, so it can vary from one quarter to next with respect to the last week and how much we shift. But it is going to be an influencing factor. So, we know it was a record four to five for the year. It would be higher than four to five in the first quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: (inaudible).
Matt Farrell: Yes, right. So it says five plus for the first quarter, because I am uncertain as to how high is high? Right.
Jim Craigie: I wish I was in the food business, you know, those terms are good for the food business. Probably going to store yesterday, I couldn’t get a parking lot outside my supermarket. People in there are buying like crazy. So, (inaudible) I have 15 years in the food business, and those terms are good, really good. They are bad for restaurants; they are good for food businesses. So check your food stocks out there. They more so sound like this people are going to load those pantries up and eat at home. What else you’ve got there, any other questions? Okay, listen, thank you for coming today. I appreciate it. If you have any further questions, give Marine [ph] a call. We will be glad to help you out. I just want to tell you, feel great about my business. Thank you. By the way, there is goody bags for all of you, and by the way, you are welcome to take the free samples on the other things that --
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-05 12:00:00) =====
Executives: James R. Craigie – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Matthew T. Farrell – Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Church & Dwight’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year. 
James R. Craigie:  Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for taking the time to join us today. By the way this is being webcast and also to tell you that any comments we make today about forward-looking statements let the buyer beware. As you all know, the entire business world is in uncharted waters today. Consumer confidence is at all-time low. Retailers are struggling to survive. Commodity costs and foreign exchange markets remain extremely volatile. I personally believe that the worldwide economy will get worst before it gets better. This business environment makes it very difficult to forecast accurately, as they say I don’t know what I don’t know.  Can you hear me in the back? Okay. But let me tell you what I do know. Despite these challenges Church & Dwight delivered outstanding Q4 in total 2008 results in terms of organic revenue growth. Gross margin expansion, increased earnings per share, and record cash flow. Second, consumers love our brands. We grew share on all eight of power brands in 2008 that represent over 80% of our revenues and profits.
.:  And finally, we will now let this recession deter us for making investments to drive our future EPS growth. We will maintain our advertising share of voice and our power brand, and we will continue to invest in delivering future cost savings, as exemplified with the startup of new state-of-the-art laundry plant that scheduled to start in Q4 of this year. If you have listened to me for the past four years, you know that I’m realistic and pragmatic. Church & Dwight have never missed an annual EPS target in my four-year reign as Chairman and CEO. We’ve had significant gains to the tune of 35%, 13%, 19% and 16% this past year.  Our 2009 plan reflects a realistic and pragmatic outlook. It assumes lower organic growth in the last few years due to the recession and retailer actions. It delivers very strong gross margin expansion; it provides a strong marketing support behind an impressive pipeline of new products, there is continued aggressive management overhead cost, and we’re targeting very strong EPS growth. I’ve always told you that this consumer packages industry is the safest place to invest in during rough economic times. And Church & Dwight is the best bet within the CPG industry, because we have the best value orientation of any CPG company. I believe in our ability to meet our 2009 plan, and I have great confidence that we continue to deliver strong TSR to our investors. Now, let me turn the podium over to Math, who will provide details on our Q4 and total 2008 results and I’ll return to talk to you about 2009.
Matthew T. Farrell: Okay. Thanks everybody. We’re going to start with the slide, I’m sure many of you are familiar with which is our total shareholder return model. This is an evergreen model, we refer to it that way, it’s an explicit model and I think it’s important for everybody to remember how we use it. It guides our annual operating plan. So, we pull this out and say are we delivering in accordance with this plan. The second thing is it guides us with respect to evaluating acquisitions. So we want to make sure acquisitions can also support us achieving this particular model. And the third thing is our incentive comp is tied to it. So this matters to us. Three key goals you should be familiar with is the top line 3% to 4% organic growth to 100 basis points of gross margin, which is second, and you run your eyes down to operating margin 60 to 70 basis points annually. So what we’re after every year is 12% to 14% EPS growth, 12% to 15% TSR that would include the dividend. We’re going to go through the quarter and then the year. So here is the fourth quarter results, you can run your eyes down to page. We had exceptional performance on all key metrics. So we surpassed our evergreen model, EPS of 44%, 11% organic growth, gross margin up 180 basis points, very wide expansion of our operating margin, 310 basis points. And finally free cash flow $92 million in the quarter. Here is some other numbers we should pay attention to. The 11% organic growth breaks out about eight volume and three being price mix. We had slightly less marketing in the quarter as a percentage of sales, which is 12.7 versus 13% last year. We got some SG&A leverage you may recall that we acquired the Orajel business. So, we got 100 basis points of leverage. [Huge] margin expansion as I pointed out before. Tax rate was a little bit higher. You probably read in the release that we had a higher mix of earnings in the United States. We also had some true up with respect to state taxes. Here is the full year, full year again exceeding all of those metrics that we looked at on the very first slide exceeding our evergreen model. So, EPS up 17, organic growth 7%, gross margin a 140 basis points, 40 basis points by the way of that was Orajel. We have a slide on that little bit later on. We will look at gross margin expansion year-over-year. And you see operating margin of 80 basis points, remember our target is 60 to 70 on an annul basis. And our free cash flow hit a record of $289 million. You’ll see on a lot of these slides, we say excluding the new plant. So we’re building a new laundry plant in York County, Pennsylvania. It’s going to cost us $170 million. We spent $15 million so far in 2008, another 100 million in 2009, and remaining 20 million in 2010. And the EPS associated with that is also stripped from our numbers. Most of that frankly is just accelerated depreciation on that plant that we’re going to shutting down. So back to the numbers, you take a look at this slide here, again the 7% is the organic growth rate for the quarter, pardon me for the year. And that splits about evenly for the year between volume and price mix. You see the 140 basis points, 40 of which was Del. Marketing you see is up 30 to 50 basis points and you are going to see a slide later on from Jim. It shows you that over the last three years, every year we’ve increased our investment in marketing 50 basis points up year-after-year. And finally, margin up 80 basis points. So, just a terrific year for the company. Just a quick look back at the quarters, the quarters were a little more evenly distributed last year with the exception of the first quarter. I’m sure many of the sell side analysts in the room remember the first quarter. And the first quarter, we were helped by a lot of one-timers and some timing, just to remind you, we had a divestiture gain in the first quarter with some mark-to-market accounting favorable on a gain, on a diesel hedge and we also had the timing of slotting very low in the first quarter. So, we expect 2009 will be a much more balanced year. So Q1 is a difficult comp for us. So low 80’s would be a reasonable expectation for the first quarter. Okay next slide, remember we said up front that our target is 3 to 4% organic growth rate. So I think it’s helpful to go and look back at the prior years versus that particular model. You can see we’ve exceeded the target in four out of the last five years. You’ll see back 2006, yeah, we did have a 2% year, but we did hit our model that year with respect to the EPS growth rate. We’re exiting this year with very strong momentum particularly in the laundry business. And Jim will say a lot more later regarding our current thinking with respect to our call for organic growth for 2009. Here is the gross margin, 140 basis points of gross margin expansion, and every quarter in 2008 was up 100 basis points or better. You may remember at the beginning of the year, like many companies we had raw material input increases put us behind the eight ball. So we had resin, soda ash, surfactants, diesel, packaging materials everything was up tremendously. So we had a 300-basis points hurdle that we had to overcome. We had a lot of margin improvement programs, we had laundry compaction helping us, we had price increases on over 50% of our products, and also the backbone of our company frankly is our cost reduction program, which we call good to great. Sounds corny, but it delivers a lot of benefit year-after year-after-year. So, our track record gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver margin expansion in the future. Now, we have three slides I want to take you through to illustrate the emphasis that we put on free cash flow in Church & Dwight. So you can see here this is free cash flow conversion. So it’s free cash flow divided by net income and our definition of free cash flow is cash from operations minus CapEx. And CapEx in this case is our base CapEx, which runs about $50 million a year. So, we don’t have the York members in here. So, we had a significant improvement in our cash conversion cycle during the past, because we had a major focus on worldwide receivables and inventory. And that working capital effort has just supercharged our free cash flow number of this year. So that’s free cash flow conversion, well over a 100% in each of the last three years. Next is working capital. So working capital is a percentage of net sales. And you see the definition there, accounts receivable plus inventory minus trade [a pay]. Now, why is this important, it’s because we view the ability to manage working capital as indicative of the strength of the internal processes within the company. It’s very difficult to knock working capital down at this rate, unless you have a lot of different functions working together. And so that 9.3 number was really supercharged by the effort that we had in the company this year. And here is the last one, here’s free cash flow as a percentage of net sales. Again this is obviously a reflection of our success in 2008 and just another solid trend, this the first time we've been in double figures with this particular metric. Let’s now move on as far as CapEx goes. CapEx is managed in a very tight band. So if you look back over the last few years, you could see, we’re generally between 2% and 2.4% of sales again excluding the new plant. And if you look at the last three years that was 6, 7 and 8, you see around $50 million a year. That’s what we should expect as well for 2009 absent the plant. So, this is an illustration that our business really is not very capital intensive. Now, looking at the balance sheet a little bit more. So our total debt-to-EBITDA again that green band is what we say is our target. So two to three times leverage you hear us, talk about many, many times. This is total debt-to-EBITDA. So, our leverage ratio is below two to three as we end the year, despite that we had a $380 million acquisition of Orajel in July, and then four of those five years on the screen we completed an acquisition. So we do have a conservative target in two to three times levered and it’s helpful to remind everybody that we do stick to it.
 : I’m going to end on this slide as far as how we use our free cash flow, and this in order of importance right now for us. So, at the top of the page is M&A, and you can see that the most recent acquisitions we have made Orajel on ’08, Oxiclean in ’06. Next, well you’d say the new product development would be second on the list, Arm & Hammer with Oxiclean was a very important and successful product launch for us in 2008, it drove a lot of our organic growth. CapEx would be number three. So we’re building a new plant. Number four, obviously that lower on the list now because we’re under our target leverage ratio. And finally, the return to cash to shareholders, we are try to increase the dividend at the same rate that we’re increasing EPS. Okay, I'm going to turn the agenda over to Jim right now?

James R. Craigie:
 : Your investments in our company and this slide [kind of] says it, why should you invest in Church & Dwight. Two reasons, we’ve had an outstanding track record of delivering superior total shareholder return. And two, we believe we have a sustainable growth model in place to continue that strong track record. Two charts, kind of interesting. This is a chart that compares Church & Dwight total shareholder return starting from your right, 10 year, five year, three year and the past year and against what we consider some major CPG competitors out there. And you can see we have a phenomenal record. We've had an average 10-year TSR of 17.9%, number one versus all those other competitors you've looked across the page. The only guy who outperformed us in recent times is [Chatem] a great little company about one-third of our size that's got a phenomenal record. But still, look at what Church & Dwight has done even in the last year we're the only guy in the positive zone on that. Now, compare that with stock market indices and this was a stunning one to me. If you invested in the S&P 500 10 years ago you have lost an average of 3% a year. You'd have been better off putting your money in a 2% money market. But certainly versus those averages which are all negative except for the Russell 2000 which barely cracks a 10 year plus. We have just blown those away. So obviously we had a great long-term track record of returning gains to our shareholder. I was talking to one of our shareholders here. And they are very happy to be an investor with Church & Dwight for a long time. So we have a good record. We're not overnight wonders. Our company is very well balanced, we have about 47% household, 41% personal care, and we have this unique business Specialty Products division, that's animal nutrition, number one, kidney dialysis solution, all of the uses of the baking soda in commercial ways. It's kind of funny. Last two years I was getting beat up all the time, why aren't you bigger internationally, and now everybody is like thank God you aren't bigger internationally. The 21% international so what's going on with foreign exchange right now, it's flipped about 20, 25% in the last three, four months. So, it's a hit for us next year, but it’s manageable, compared to the companies who have monstrous numbers to deal with there. What are the reasons why we have strong TSR growth? There’s five. The strong revenue growth, steady margin expansion, aggressive overhead cost management, accretive bolt-on acquisitions and we have a very experienced motivated management team. We have over 40 brands in Church & Dwight, but there are eight brands that make up the bulk of the profits and revenue. And these are the eight brands. ARM & HAMMER about 35% of our company, this brand is more out of the grocery store than any other brand in America and it’s an 86% in US households. Trojan number one condom brand Oxiclean number one laundry additive brand, SpinBrush number one battery powered toothbrush brand, First Response number one pregnancy kit brand, Nair number one depilatory brand, Orajel number one oral healthcare pain relief brand and Xtra which is a pretty major value brand there. Again over 80% of our revenues and profits come from these eight brands. And I can probably say in 2008, all eight of these brands grew share last year, and you can see the numbers there. I also want to point out, the two small numbers on that page, you might say Arm & Hammer look to 13.6% and Xtra [about] only 4% we make up 10% of the dollar share in the laundry category. But we make up over 20% of the unit share in the category. One out of every five-laundry bottles sold in America comes from our company. That’s second only the P&G. And you can see the share growth, we had across all those categories last year. One of the big reasons, why we’ve been accelerating new product development, since I came on Board, we created a separate new product development team. They’ve launched a record number of new products last year. We’re not into numbers anymore. We’re trying for fewer new launches of bigger and better new launches. And it shows in the chart, we got 7% organic growth last year, terrific number. Here is the bunch of new products we’ve launched Arm & Hammer with Oxiclean was the most successful in the laundry product they’ve been launched Arm & Hammer [Inaudible] Trojan is doing very well. Odor Alert with the cat litter, where it turns blue where the cat soils the cat litter, which is great because you want to get all the sold product out to keep smell down. Other products there, the SpinBrush, Swirl was the lowest price battery-powered toothbrushes did very well, digital pregnancy kits, Shower Power. The first time a women to take depilatory in the Shower, where most women remove their hair on their legs, couldn’t do before would wash off too quickly now you can do it in the Shower and get the benefits of the depilatory products, which is smoother legs and longer lasting hair removals. At the same time behind all this new products, we’ve been increasing market investments. As you can you can see we’ve gone up a 150 basis points in the last three years. So more new products better marketing support for them. Here is one of the best example, Arm & Hammer are biggest brand. When I came to this company 2004 it was growing at 1% pretty pathetic, four years later 11.3% growth last year, phenomenal. Let’s talk about steady margin expansion we’ve grown gross margins over 400 basis points in the past four years do the math, that’s the 100 basis points a year. We’ve proven we can do this, we believe we continue to do this. Our goal is to keep doing that, we want to reach a 45% gross margin by 2012. That’s averaging again 100 basis points a year. A half of that will come from internal efforts, organic efforts, half of that through buying margin accretive acquisitions. Let’s start with overhead cost management. This is my favorite slide in the whole deck. In the past four years, four year ago we’re 1.5 billion in sales. We had 3,741 employees that works out to $391,000 per employee. Four years later we’ve grown sales 60% to 2.4 billion, yet, we cut employees by 5% to 3,530, that’s works out to $6,000 per employee up 75% growth in that number. That beats anybody in the CPG industry including big guys out in Cincinnati who are 40 times our size. That’s a phenomenal result. So, it’s pretty terrific when you can grow the top line, grow the margin and not spent back some of that on the SG&A line actually have it lower, so terrific thing of our company. How do we do that, a lot of ways, but I want to tell you the truth, it’s not over, we’re continuing to restructure the organization, we’re continuing to consolidate our worldwide supply chain. Last year we sold out of Spain, we closed the plant in England that’s all going to benefit this year. And we have very tight control over healthcare cost. So that trend is going to continue. That’s all about acquisitions. We love them, but we have a very defined criteria for them. We will only buy number one or number two brands, we want higher growth, higher margin brands, we prefer asset light brands. We want to take those businesses, we want their brands, we don’t want their people, we don’t want their plans, we don’t their headquarters, we throw it all in the back of our existing organizations. And we believe that the strength of our company in sales and marketing we can drive share growth in those businesses. I showed you before there is eight brands that drive 80% of our revenues and profit. We didn’t own seven of those brands in the year 2000. We have acquired them since then and built them. That’s the model, all those brands of the criteria except for one the 2003 acquisition Unilever did not fit our model criteria, they weren’t number one, number two brands and honestly we look back and we had a second choice, we wouldn’t have done it. And those brands have not done that well. But everything else has been terrific you can see we have tripled our revenues since 2000, driven by those acquisitions and organic growth. And here is the case in the last three acquisitions. The Spinbrush Oxiclean and Orajel.  You see in all cases we paid between 100 to $400 million, we picked up 100 million to $200 million in sales. They all had higher margins they were in categories we knew about, so we didn't have to hire new people to run them, they were in oral care and laundry, two are biggest business. They were number one in the marketplace, and they all very asset light. I mean Oxiclean is one of the best thing, OxiClean was a family owned business of Denver, Colorado with about $200 million of sales. As an independent company, they were making $15 million and had to pay for headquarters and sales forces, they were co-packed, we bought that business. We got rid of their headquarters. Out of the 150 people we hired 10 people. We brought their products out of their co-packages to our plant at cheaper costs. In one year, we tripled the profits on that business. And since then we’ve grown the market share in that business from the mid 20s up to actually 40 shares in the latest Nielsen report. Finally, I've said before and I'll say it again, the experienced motivated management team, my management team comes from was trained at all the great companies. I came from 15 years of Kraft, Matt came from years of Allied Signal, my Head of Marketing has 25 years of J&J, my Head of HR came from Bethlehem Steel. Let me tell you something. You want to get an HR manager, get it out of the steel industry. They know how to deal with tough situation, my Head of R&D, Reckitt Benckiser. We are very proactive, we are highly committed, we are very passionate and we are very action oriented. By the way, all of us after having 10, 15, 20 years in those major CPG companies. We probably spent 3 to 5 years in the private equity world, a very different world, very aggressive, more action oriented, basic goal of double the size of the company in three to five years and sell it. We will guess what in the past four years; we doubled the size of Church & Dwight. It took 150 years to get to one place and four years we double that. And we walk the walk in overhead controls. Nobody in my company has a company car including me. We don't have golf club memberships and we don't corporate jets. I think we're a little ahead of the world in this trend. And the management team, we are 100% in the game. Our bonuses are tied to the four factors that drive total shareholder return. 25% of our bonus is based on our revenue targets, 25% gross margin expansion, 25% operating margin, 25% free cash flow. Our equity compensation is 100% stock options. If stock doesn’t go up they are worthless, we don’t have restricted stock that's worth something no matter what happens. We don’t have performance-based units based on some crazy formula. It's pure stock, just you when you buy our stock. And we're required to have skin in the game. We have to invest in the company stock. All right. That's great, Jim, about the past. We want to know about the future. We believe we can sustain that kind of growth in the future, again it starts with the eight key power brands, it's focused behind four trends I'll talk to you about. We have a strong pipeline of innovative products and it supported by increased marketing spending. These will drive our strong revenue growth.  Here again are the eight power brands, the four trends that those are largely focused on are value, pets, green, and sex. How is that for four trends? Hey, I don't even talk about the world. The world is going to value right now. The rising unemployment out there, the rapid contraction of housing prices, declining consumer spending, tight credit markets. I said earlier on, I think it's going to get a heck of a lot worse before it gets better out there based on my belief, and its very sad but it’s a tough world. This is why we are different than other CPG companies. Over 30% of our portfolio is value based, but here is very specific facts. And that 30% basis makes us recession resistant than any of the CPG companies. Our laundry brands, Arm & Hammer and Xtra are 50 to 55% cheaper than Tide, the category leader. Our fabric sheet business also Arm & Hammer get 50% lower than Bounce, number one fabric sheet business. We have toothpaste brands like Aim, which are 50% lower than Crest and Colgate. We have pregnancy kit, we have two we are the leader at premium price First Response. We also have a value brand, Answer, growing at double-digit that 30% lower than other brands in a category, and in cleaner category, a small but we have brands like Scrub Free that are 45% lower than Scrubbing Bubbles, a category leader there. Private label, lot of talk about private label, it is a threat, we believe it’s a manageable threat. You see in most of our categories, today private label is a fairly small share. It's only big in three parts, cat litter, baking soda and pregnancy kits, but we listed here in 2008 how much private label share gains where. As you can see for the most part they are not big. As Nielsen just finished a study recently and said the biggest drop in private label will come in categories, where private label already big, hey it make sense people have already tried it. So when they are hurting for money, they've already tried it before and they will try it again. In categories they have never tried it, they will be resistant to try something they've never tried before. But you can see there, and I can show you a baking soda yes, where 80% share, private label 20% share. There is nobody else. We lost two points from last year. We took price increase and the category had profit growth to it. Pregnancy kit is a big factor, but we actually gained share in pregnancy kits last year with the great work we did in our First Response brand and the gain on the Answer brand. Talk about pets for a second, it is an interesting fact I love. Almost two-thirds of the households today have a pet. Only one-third have a kid. America is becoming a pet world. That's why all the people in CPG want to feed them, and we take care of the other end.
 : People are throwing away tons of plastic bottles filling our landfills, and only 7% recycle. Big opportunities there, about 2.5, 3 years ago, we launched a sub brand of Arm & Hammer essentials, we first launch in the laundry detergent, that in the fabric softeners, then underarm deodorant, then cat litter and just most recently in cleaners. Nice little business, growing double we have over $35 million in net sales so far and this is a nice steady safe business going forward with the consumer trends. Talk about sex. We folks are not a sexually healthy nation 19 million people in this country every year are infected with sexually transmitted disease. 1/14 girls have an STI. AIDS, which was on a decline, is now back on a rise again. Nearly 3 million unintended pregnancies in this country and there are 2 billion unprotected sex acts a year. One out of four sex acts in this country between two people who don't know each others sexual health, only one out of four use a condom, three out of four times people take a risk of getting sexually transmitted disease, that's why we have those horrible statistics there. Hey, we win either way. Either use our condom where we have a 75 shares, or don’t use our condom, you’ll use our pregnancy kits. So and we have record with a record shares in both businesses. However, I'm being kind of funny, our condom business again is only used one out of the four times it should be used. We would like to drive that number north and we’ve been trying desperately through new product that marketing campaigns to do that. And I’d like to show you, you’re the first to see this, this will be a commercial running on Valentine’s Day this year, which happens to be one of the five highest points in the year for sexual acts. So take a look at our new TROJAN commercial. [Commercial Advertisement]  You guys aren’t laughing? Come on, we’re trying to get people wake-up; this is what’s going on America. The spread of diseases is out of control and we’re trying to get people to wake up above, use a condom every time. So, on pipeline innovative new products, here is a smattering of them, a new in the fabric softener world. We are combining both the liquid and the sheet into one. A two in one product, a hot trend in a lot of category, You are going to throw this into the dryer and you get the benefits of both liquid and sheet fabric softeners. A new form of OxiClean spot treater, doing tremendous, off to a great start. Condoms, two things. We have what we call the condom card. One of the biggest issue with condom usage as people say I didn’t have a condom on me, when the act occurred. We now have a new condom card it comes with a very heavy plastic case that actually I think snaps in two, you can put one into your wallet or purse, it’s very discrete doesn’t scream condom on it. And you can have it in your purse and won’t get crushed in your wallet over time. We expect to do a lot of business on this one, especially at C-stores and people can run into and get something out quickly and then I will be preserved in your pocketbook or wallet in that. A new condom that’s had a new shape, that's actually more sensitive called Ecstasy coming out. New things on Nair, for different forms of the Shower Power very successful, and a Nair version of exfoliator for skin. That's a new Orajel product and a new SpinBrush. Sonic has a much higher speed SpinBrush, a more powerful cleaner. These kind of brushes usually cost anywhere from 50 to $150. We're launching this one for $15, should be interesting. And again we’ve increased marketing support, I've told you we've been increasing steadily over the years. I'll tell you in a few minutes we'll hold flat on dollars next year, but the spot market on marketing spending right now is down between 10 to 20%. So we'll get a lot more impressions for the same amount of money. So in a sense our spending is going up, but we don’t have to go up to get impressions. All right, let me talk about 2009. Once again the model, start with the models as Matt said, this is our evergreen annual model we target to, but every year has little pluses or minuses on each one of those with one exception. We want to get the 12% to 15% total shareholder return. Look at our model. Look at what we're telling you. We only believed in this world right now with what’s going on with consumer trends, what's going on with retailers that 2% are realistic guidance right now. Honestly, I believe the worst is yet to come. I will be honest with you in the 11 out of the 12 categories we compete in category, not our business, but total category. Consumer buying was down exiting last year, and I don't view the end of last year, as a rough time, rough time; it's going to be a lot worse. So when I look at this next year, it’s going to continue to decline across the year. And I think calling 2% is very realistic. Other CPG companies are mostly calling between 2 to 5 I think 2% is very realistic going forward. And I can get 12 to 14% earnings growth with only 2% organic revenue growth. Margin, we’ll do better than or equal to a 400 basis points next year, good year on margin. Market is [little] technical, we are going to hold dollars flat in that case. SG&A overhead, lower next year. Lower dollar spending in SG&A, I’ll tell you why in a minute. Tax rate is about 36% that leads when operating margin of over 100 basis points and that leads to 12 to 14% EPS growth. Hey, beginning of the year, we usually come out and say at this point in time with all of the uncertainty going on in this marketplace, we think it’s an appropriate start, 12% to 14% to my knowledge is the best EPS call in the CPG industry of any CPG competitor out there. So we’re at the high end of the range. Let me tell about the reasons, 2% organic growth. What’s the good news? Pricing last year, we priced 30% of our portfolio that will lap into this year. We got a strong pipeline of new products, almost all of which are margin accretive. And we exited last year with very strong share trends, very strong share trends, good news. But big but lower category volumes due to consumer spending. I just see a continued decline in consumer spending across the year. Private label, every retailer in this country will talk about growing private label. They see this is the right time to do it, they see the time when consumers are looking for value. The majority of private label brands are value, and retailers are pushing hard to grow their private label brands why, they make more margin.  So they believe this is the time if ever the time to grow private label. We think that will cause pain. I told you before private label is not big, but with almost every retailer out there pushing, it’s going to be a year with some pain to share. I don't think it will last long personally. I think a year from now they will all back off somewhat and go back to brands, but I think 2009 is going to be a year of pain from private label. The other thing, retailers are in a big effort to reduce SKUs now. They want to get their inventory down and they’re reducing the inventories and pay SKU harder than ever before. You add that up in my mind, and I think a realistic and prudent call on organic revenue growth is 2% at this point in time. I hope I’m wrong, but I think it is prudent at this point in time. Gross margin this is great news, we have five factors driving gross margin. Three are common industry. We’ve had pricing and mix action again we put pricing over 50% of our portfolio last year. That's lapping into this year we are not going to lead any price decline. Lower commodity costs, you‘ve seen what’s happening there’s a big drop off in a lot of commodity costs a few that are up, but the bulk of them are down that’s a cost saving benefit, as Matt said this corny program called Good To Great but it works. It’s reformulation, reducing packaging, reducing SKUs, hedging on commodities. We've had tremendous costs benefits on that, a very strong program in our company. But every company has those three basic factors. Two that are very unique to us that help us deliver better gross margin expansion like anybody else. The acquisition we bought Orajel middle late last year, the bulk of the benefit will come through that year that’s a 60 plus gross margin business $100 million you do the math. Laundry compaction was completed about the middle of last year. It was a nice benefited gross margin on laundry business. So we will get benefit in the first half of this year in which it wasn't totally compacted last year. Hey folks we are not stopping, we are looking beyond 2009 to 2010 whereas we speak we're building a fantastic new laundry plan in York County, Pennsylvania. It’s going to be about 25% more efficient than our plant in New Jersey and everything is going very smoothly on speed and again we will get benefits from this starting Q4, but mostly 2010 to help our gross margin again get to our goal the 100 basis points a year. Marketing wise, again, dollars are flat, we have increased as I said before marketing spending over 150 basis points last three years, but advertising cost less right now. I have seen the spot marketing were 10 to 20% lower than was a year ago. So, the same amount of dollars we can buy by more impressions and that allows us to maintain or grow we hope our share of voice for all of our categories. SG&A, we are just mongers about this. We had continued tight control, we consolidated our worldwide supply chain to take cost out and we benefited from divesting businesses last year in Spain and selling a plant in U.K. So SG&A dollars lower in 2009. So it all adds up to a very steady record that we've had in this growing EPS. Again 12 to 14% is actually the low end of what we’ve kind of done the last in the four years. But I think, it’s an economy right now going on there, it’s a very aggressive call again. I don’t know, if CPG company who is over 10% right now. So I think calling 12 to 14% is aggressive where it is right now. Be nice to beat that, but I think it’s a very prudent call right now in the business world. As I said earlier, if you believe [in the future] buyer beware. With that Matt and I will take questions that you may have.
Operator: [Inaudible]
Unidentified Analyst: Just on the Orajel side, if I'm doing the math correctly, this 40 basis points that’s the gross margin now, has been able to keeping moving from 30–40 basis points in there and in fact that and then 70, all I need is another 60 basis points for proposed to do it?
James R. Craigie: Yeah, the way to think about 100 basis points, because what we say, we are expecting to meet or exceed 100 basis points. Netted in that 100 basis points, as we are actually overcoming a big drag from Fx transaction. So what that means is that in Canada, Mexico and some European countries to the extent we source in U.S. dollars, cost of goods sold for those countries it is going to be significantly higher to see about 10 to $12 million. It’s actually totaling about $.0.11 in EPS. But that is a drag that we are overcoming as well in our 100 basis points. So that alone will be about 50 basis points that were covering. So but you are right. The impact from Orajel next year would probably about 50 basis points.
Unidentified Analyst: Jim, can you maybe help us understand your, I mean the prudent caution. Are you seeing in January first part of February de-stock retailers focusing on private label versus your brand, slow down in sales or something or is that just caution on what could happen remainder of the year?
James R. Craigie: I expect the year to get worse, we are seeing a little bit of it right now, we expect the situation deteriorate over the course of the year, based on what we are hearing from retailers and based on the consumer trends we are seeing. So it is a projection, the year is actually also a pretty decent start, but we are seeing signs of what’s going on out there that make us nervous, make us very nervous. And if I had said at this point in time, we can’t get the 12 to 14% earnings growth with only calling 2% organic growth and I think in the end, I wont call it a worse case, but I think at the end we are prudent realistic case in the year. And again I mean the other guys are – other major companies were only calling from the most part 2 to 5. We are not like minus 5, we are in the plus 5, and they are doing what the hell are you doing. We are very much closed to arrange – into the range we’re just calling in our eyes are low end of the range based on what we see out there. But again early, it’s largely our forecast what's happening.
Unidentified Analyst:  Just I have a follow up on the first quarter you’ve called for this 2% organic growth for next year and you just reported 11% organic growth. So one might I think that maybe your shipments were ahead of consumer concession in the fourth quarter and ticking and that’s coming out of the first quarter. So could you just comment whether your organic growth in the first quarter is above or below that 2%?
Unidentified Company Representative: That would be above. And as Jim points out, we expect a deterioration and category spending throughout the year. And there was no inventory loading in the fourth quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: And may be a reason for that 2% organic growth was just the tough comp in the fourth quarter for next year?
Unidentified Company Representative:  That’s part…
Unidentified Company Representative:  That is an issue…
Unidentified Company Representative:  Yeah, that’s going to be a difficult comp for us once we get to the end of the year and kind of the countries is in worse shape.
Unidentified Analyst:  Okay and then the fourth quarter could you take apart that 17% increase a little bit more. How much were your detergents up and did that match your sell-through at retail in your view?
Unidentified Company Representative:  You’re referring to the 17% in your eyes is the retail growth number, organically 11% for us. But in general yes, our laundry business is doing exceptionally well right now, it’s all of the value oriented businesses we have are doing very well right now, but I will also tell with you again we grew all eight of our power brand last year. Every one of our brands had a very good fourth quarter last year, but laundry was exceptionally good in the fourth quarter. There was no meaningful inventory low.
Unidentified Analyst: So, detergents were up something like 25%?
Unidentified Company Representative:  We don't comment by category.
Unidentified Analyst:  Could you comment on how much your market shares in detergents were up at retail including all of the retailers like Wal-Marts?
Unidentified Company Representative:  Most probably I don’t have a numbers in front of me.
Unidentified Company Representative:  Arm & Hammer Liquid Laundry up year-over-year. Is strong – it is strong.
Unidentified Analyst: Did you gain 3 points of share?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, no, not that much at all, no…
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, I was if you could talk a little more about the pricing environment I guess the commodities coming down retailers pushing back harder if you have a very weak demand environment, maybe some of the competitors get more promotional what gives you the confidence that you're going to see the pricing environment hold about as well as you are?
Unidentified Company Representative: I would just say so far so good in all of our businesses I've not heard of one price decline actions. I said we're certainly not going to lead any actions we only have lead the world and categories where we are large Trojan, banking soda business are the ones we lead and the rest we follow and the category leaders in all of those other categories have not show any kind of taking place to drive. So I'll be honest with you, I think on the other categories, the leaders in those categories had much more significant foreign exchange problems than we do they got to make up for those in some race and I think – I think the big guy in Cincinnati have been very clear. They do not intend to lead any price declines. But then again if there is continued significant decline in commodities and those pressures from retailers who knows, I'll just say the same thing they said. I don’t intend to lead price declines but again I only believe in a couple of category, rest of the – both of the categories we follow. But everything I'm seeing the competition is nobody else there is saying they are going to be taking place decline they only have – heard about out there is pro-acting in the coverage bags and we don’t compete in that category.
Unidentified Analyst:  And then just a quick one on the self space comment, you elude that private label picking up space did you go through and you have private label shares that are less than 5% in the book of the categories. Is there any one category in particular were you seeing, have your increases and private label self space and I get what if they are coming from such a small base and the gains are coming from categories where prior label and higher share positions…
Unidentified Company Representative: I would say every category, but in a lot of the categories we are in, we are hearing what the retailers are talking about pushing private label harder, they are going to do that, they are going to increase their shelf space for the brands, that means other guys lose, that’s how we see. We see that happening, it is pretty much across the board, it is the talk of the talk in the retail industry right now, every retailer out there is talking about my share of private label is this, I want to take it to this, and they’re looking for every opportunity they can do it, and to do that they’ve got to take more shelf space up to their brands, more merchandising space, more merchandising effort up to their brands and it is an early call, but we are nervous about it. Even though in the end, they’re not going to become category leaders, but there is going to pain by everybody in those categories, if the retailers who control distribution, who control merchandise, they can control pricing, are going to have the ball in their hands to what to do and all they are talking about right now is going private label. So, we are nervous.
Unidentified Analyst: So, no sense that you think you can hit disproportionally versus other brands?
Unidentified Company Representative: Not at this point in time.
Unidentified Analyst: I mean, just last one, on the marketing spending side, do you guys tend to buy a lot more spot or upfront? 
Unidentified Company Representative: We are about 50-50.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: But which is honestly even more than I think most people are, it is about half of our budgets in the spot side, and that’s right, the upfront has held amazingly, the networks are refusing to renegotiate the upfront from what we’ve seen, spot market is always is a daily thing and the spot market right now is generally down between 10 to 20% versus year ago.
Unidentified Analyst: So we should we think of your ad spending rates being down 5 to 10 versus flat in [collars] than your weights are up 5 to 10, is that a reason we can think about it?
Unidentified Company Representative: That’s reasonable.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Jim can you just talk about, you talk about destocking, I mean is there any fair dilution, because that the destocking is so far, looks like it’s been more at the distribution center side, but have any of your brands or anybody else has actually just been thrown out point blank?
Unidentified Company Representative: I’m not going to comment by category, but that is a risk, Bill, that retailers are again, it’s just sort of like private label, they talk about it for years, but now they are really doing stuff on both private label, Inventory, SKU reductions, destocking like never before. And so yes, there could be, in particular accounts we lose some businesses, but also I’ll tell you truth in a lot of our top brands we’re gaining distribution, but we see overall, I would say it's a net negative this year, because the retailers are more than ever doing and we can't control it. We can go and argue with them, but if they decide to reduce the SKUs or knock an item out or two in that and their account, I mean they control the decision. And like I said we just never seen it at this level before going on. So, it will be a, that's why we’re, without that I would certainly call higher organic growth. But I just think over the course of the year, there is going to be pain to pay for it, and again I think 12 to 18 months from now, the retailers in large part will realize their business grew less than it would have if they kept the brand assortments, they've had or kept the SKUs they had. But they are convinced right now is the time to go private label and they're pushing it harder than ever and they’re delisting SKUs harder than ever and they’re pushing inventories lower harder than ever. They are cash strapped. You've seen the same-store comp sales. They are not good and these guys are cash flow junkies as we are and they’re looking for ways to preserve their cash, grow their margins, and they again decided private label is the best time ever to push it.
Unidentified Analyst: March is sort of planogram season for most of your categories, right? So wouldn't you know what's staying and what’s going?
Unidentified Company Representative: It’s something in discussion right now, that's where there is early signs with some of the retailers on a large number of the businesses. What we're seeing is we haven't seen final plans, but we've seen enough to make us worry. We've seen enough to make us worry what's going on.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: And that’s why I say it’s realistic and prudent in our eyes to take a lower position, a low-end of the zone of CPG, in the 2% zone right now to see what happens. God forbid, I hope I'm wrong. I hope I’m wrong. And I am hoping some of the retailers may reverse any decisions they make before the year is over and put stuff back in. But at this point in time it's a prudent position to take I think of calling, because again we can get the 12 to 14% earnings growth, which is the 2% organic growth call.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and hypothetically, which one of the products might be at risk to?
James R. Craigie: I’m not going to go category-by-category in that. Almost anything is at risk for competitive reasons and retailer reasons, I just don’t want to get into what we know from each. Retailers get upset if we even told what they were doing. We’ve been warned even competitors don't know what’s happening by certain cases on that. So, we've been warned too many times. We can’t talk what retailers are doing because they do it as, we don't want to even know we are doing stuffing like that. So, we have enough insight at this point in time to make us nervous.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then what was the input cost headwind and basis points this year and what you are expecting for ’09?
James R. Craigie: For ’08 it was 300.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
James R. Craigie: So 300 basis points a hurt in ‘07 going away.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And do you have an outlook for '09?
James R. Craigie: Yeah. We have done the slide for ’09 with the gross margin bridge from ’08 to ’09. No, in another words am I going to call what, how many basis points improvement we are going to get from commodities, but it’s going to be substantial.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Are there any adverse hedges like a layover from July when you probably locked up some stuff?
James R. Craigie: Yeah. We had to hedge for a couple million gallons of diesel oil for '09, by about a $11 million annually. So, a $2 million of the $11 million and because of mark-to-market accounting that’s been marked down to the low price as of 12/31. So, that’s not going to really hurt us next year other than on cash side.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
James R. Craigie: But not from a P&L standpoint.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. But the gross margin would have been even better if you didn’t have these hedges in place this quarter than the 108 basis points, yeah.
James R. Craigie: No, that hedge is not going to hurt us in this quarter. It's only going to hurt us to the extent that oil goes down to $20.
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
James R. Craigie: If that happens.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and then lastly just on the specialty chemicals business, I mean that's a more economically sensitive business. I mean its still about 50% of sales, right, I mean what's the outlook for that that piece?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yes. There is two prices to the specialty products business, half of it is dairy, and half it is chemicals. On the chemical side, the big part is of it is chemicals. On the chemicals side the big part is bulk sodium bicarbonate, and if you think about bulk sodium bicarbonate, where does it go, it goes into food. So, craft the food companies would bulk sodium bicarbonate would also be used in industrial, but water filtrations et cetera. So, there are things on that side that actually, kidney dialysis as well. So, there are a number of things that keep that business pretty steady, and who we went to look back at previous recessions and saw that side of the business is pretty strong. On the other side of the business, the dairy business, the dairy farmers are struggling because price of milk has come down, inventory levels are also rising a bit, that's because that exports are down as well for milk. So, what has to happen on that side is that the number of cows have to be taken out of the system and that's happening right now. So, to the extent that happens over the next 6 to 12 months, price of milk would start going back up, they can get healthier. So, there is going to be some softness on that side of the business, animal nutrition.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks very much.
James R. Craigie: Okay. Question is by Connie?
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: Hi. What do you estimate the days or weeks of inventory of your products to be at retail is it growing or declining?
Matthew T. Farrell: Specifically four to six weeks with the supply.
James R. Craigie: And it's been relatively flat, maybe a little down. We've not seen a huge de-stocking issue across our brands.
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Do you also think some of your customers will file for bankruptcy of this year and if they do with that disrupt your sales and shipments as that inventory works its way around?
Unidentified Company Representative: We monitor our retail is very, very closely, not only the retailers, but the other side that is equally as important is our vendors. We do have less co-packers and people that ship as raw materials and some of them aren't that big. So we've got a process in place to study both in very closely but right now, I wouldn't say we have a big exposure to our sales base as a result of the economy.
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: And does the tight credit markets affect your supply chain in anyway?
Unidentified Company Representative: It can affect smaller suppliers to the extent that they don't have a credit line and they are dependent upon their weekly monthly cash flows. So that’s why the smaller vendors were more concerned about it. It hasn’t gotten to the point now, people are looking for us to bank them, it hasn’t gotten to this.
James R. Craigie: Yeah, we had a wake up call last year, the largest trigger spray manufacturer in this country went bankrupt suddenly caught everybody by surprise, everybody in industry the cleaner industry using trigger sprayers was caught short, we had a source around the world and it cost us an extra money. It woke us up to the fact that how on the edge some of these suppliers are, it led to a major effort [inaudible] group to study everyone of our suppliers out there very careful, because there was risk, we had gotten dual sources and things like that. So that won’t happen again. And luckily, we managed it okay. It didn’t affect supply, but it got very close at certain points in time.
Unidentified Analyst: Right and just a follow up question what were Orajel sales in the fourth quarter?
James R. Craigie: Well, we typically don’t call the sales of an acquisition but the thing you should remember that the annual sales for Orajel were about 100 million, and it’s a pretty linear business, so you can do the math.
Unidentified Analyst: Jim, excuse me, can you talk a little bit about the M&A environment. What do you think the odds are you will be able to execute another acquisition in this year?
James R. Craigie: Good question, but M&A, there is a lot of opportunities out there. As usual, a lot of it is junk, a lot of strategics are doing some strategic portfolio looking right now or looking to shed business, which is good news a concern is though that there is not a lot bidders of the doors as usual because of the credit market so tough, private equity is not at the door it's slowed some of the auctions. But even some of the strategic players are not been able to source cash right now. So, it leading to some of the sellers, we thinking whether they want to sit back and wait, because in most cases these are big companies they don’t need to sell and they are deciding whether or not maybe [I’ll wait 6 to 12] months for the credit market opened up then have a bigger line of the door have a more competitive auction. So in some sense because of that it may result a little bit of slowdown, but I would say we are actively on the trials, the couple of opportunities right now but again we don’t know in the end of the seller, we will go through with the deal. But I still hope so, we are in a great shape, we’ve got Matt showed you, how much, $700 million, if we push what we have availability on?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yeah, as far $200 million of cash and $200 million of undrawn lines and we have given our rating and on the level of cash flow we will be able to access our credit line, we have an accordion feature where we can borrow another $250 million.
James R. Craigie: So plenty of, our usual range is 1 to $400 million for an acquisition, so we have the money we can make deals right now. It's just the case will sellers be willing to sell without thinking they could wait a little long and get a little better price.
Unidentified Analyst: Are those strategic sellers mostly the big pharma companies. 
James R. Craigie: They are the key players. That isn't all of them though.
Unidentified Analyst: Would it be a preference to stay in the OTC pharmaceutical area?
James R. Craigie: No, we like that area, we are in that area, but no, we again, we’re always I would say agnostic between household and personal care. Orajel was one of our best acquisitions every in the household side, I’m sorry OxiClean was. Orajel was great, I mean we will go anywhere at the number one or two brand, margin accretive, asset light and growth opportunity.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
James R. Craigie: That’s where we don’t care. Any other questions?
James R. Craigie: Well, all right. Hey I think I said to you my mantra going forward is in these rough economic times and again I’m probably more draconian than most, I think it’s going to be a very, very rough year for us not that only the U.S., but the world. The consumer package industry is the safest bet you can place out there. Within the industry we are probably the safest bet in there, we’ve got a long track record of delivering the numbers. I think our strategies are on track and our great momentum, and I think we’re realistic and prudent at this point in time, 12 to 14% EPS growth, I think is the top on anybody is calling right now and I’ve a pretty good assurance in my mind we can deliver those numbers, so I want to thank you all for coming today and if you have any other further follow up questions we are always available down in Princeton, New Jersey or by phone. And have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead sir.
Jim Craigie: Thank you, Chantal and good morning to everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you particularly when we have good results to report. I'll begin this call by providing my perspective on our excellent third quarter, which you've read about in the press release issued this morning. Let me start off by saying that I'm very proud of my company for both the quality and magnitude of our results particularly in this recessionary worldwide business environment. Our business results reflect an organization that is highly motivated and firing on all cylinders. Our new product pipeline and increased marketing spending is driving strong organic growth despite softening consumer demand. Our business teams and supply chain organization are working closely together to deliver exceptional growth margin expansion despite the volatility in commodity prices. Everyone is continuing to keep it tight around on overhead costs. This is proven by the fact that we have the same number of employees today as we had four years ago despite of 50% increase in sales during that time. We are squeezing every dollar out of our working capital to drive a significant increase in cash flow. That increased cash flow and strong balance sheet is also enabling us to smartly invest in our future through accretive bolt-on acquisitions and building new plants to further lower our cost structure and strengthen our competitive advantage. While we are feeling bullish about our company's business momentum, we are very cognizant of the very tough business environment facing all companies these days. Consumer confidence is at a record low. Consumers are trading down and we believe that consumer spending is going to get worse before it gets better. However, Church & Dwight had handled this crisis exceptionally well so far in 2008. As demonstrated by our strong organic revenue growth, our gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share increase. No other consumer packages company that I can think of is as well suited to handle a recession as Church & Dwight. We've achieved share gains in 2008 across almost everyone of our core category, including liquid and powdered laundry detergent, laundry additives, cat litter, battery-powered toothbrushes, depilatories, diagnostic kits, and condoms. And we face less of a threat of consumer trading down because over 30% of our domestic portfolio consists of value-oriented products. Finally, we have a superb plan in place to continue to deliver on our goal of growing gross margin by at least 100 basis points per year. We promised that result for 2008 at a time when oil was less than $100 per barrel. We delivered against that goal in the first nine months of 2008 with a gross margin gain of 130 basis points despite oil rising as high as $140 per barrel. We will continue to deliver against that objective. You may wonder how Church & Dwight can still do this when most other consumer packages companies are showing gross margin decline. The answer is that Church & Dwight has four key factors driving gross margin. The first two are common to other consumer packages companies that in we have all taken pricing. In Church & Dwight case, we have priced over 50% of our revenue base in 2008. And I assume the other CPG companies have been cutting their overhead costs wherever possible. On top of these two common industry factors, Church & Dwight has two unique factors. First, the compaction of liquid laundry detergent product which started in September of 2007 and finished its national rollout in June of 2008 has generated significant cost savings that have more than offset the cost increases in this commodity sensitive business. Second, we had $10 million of manufacturing cost synergies starting last October for the integration of the acquired OGI brands primarily OXICLEAN into our manufacturing facility. Not only did we have these four factors driving gross margin expansion, but when commodity prices started to rise dramatically in early 2008, we exceeded our assumptions on all four factors through an extraordinary effort by the whole Church & Dwight organization. In this regard, we took more pricing than originally forecasted. We achieved more cost savings than expected, the liquid laundry detergent conversion went better than expected, and we exceeded the cost savings on the manufacturing synergies on the integration of the OGI acquisition. When you combined this incredible effort on cost savings with the great pipeline of new products, increased marketing spending, site overhead controls, and squeezing working capital, you get the high quality business results achieved by Church & Dwight so far in 2008. Organic revenue growth of 4% in Q3, and 6% year-to-date. Gross margin expansion of 100 basis points in Q3, and 130 points year-to-date excluding the new plant charges. Earnings per share growth of 6% in Q3 and 10% year-to-date excluding the one-timers and free cash flow increase of 15% in Q3 and 61% year-to-date excluding capital expense for the new plant. These results are not surprising to us as we expect to continue to deliver solid organic revenue growth of 3 to 4% and gross margin expansion of at least 100 basis points annually. I will provide more detail in my outlook to the year in a few minutes. I will now turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide you with greater insights on the financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date.
Matt Farrelll: Hey. Thank you, Jim. Good morning everybody. I'm going to start with EPS. Our reported third quarter EPS was $0.69 per share, compared with $0.75 in 2007. The current year quarter included a $0.04 charge for restructuring costs related to the closing of our North Brunswick complex which we'll be closing in the fourth quarter of 2009. It's also noteworthy that last year's third quarter results benefited by approximately $0.04 of earnings from a property sale in Canada and also $0.02 of tax benefits. So, if you exclude these items, EPS was up about 6% from a year ago and a strong sales performance and gross margin expansion that Jim referred to was the drivers of the third quarter earnings results. One other thing, in our press release, we noted that we sold our business in Spain for a small net gain. The transaction created a low effective tax rate but it had a little effect on EPS since it was offset by the pre-tax loss on the sale which is included in SG&A. You'll see both of those numbers in the release. Our revenues now, revenues were up approximately 9% of which about 1% was due to currency and 4% due to the sales of products acquired from the Del acquisition. So .the organic growth for the quarter was 4%. And of the 4% organic growth, the majority is due to price mix as oppose to volume. So, now let's go through the segments. The domestic business had a strong quarter. Revenues were up about 9.7%, 5% of which was from the Del brands. The organic growth was driven by XTRA liquid laundry, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry, OXICLEAN powder, ARM & HAMMER Powdered Laundry, Arm & Hammer Dental Care and ARM & HAMMER Super Scoop cat litter and about half of the domestic organic growth came from volume and the balance from price mix. We successfully raised prices earlier in the year you'll remember for ARM & HAMMER Powdered Laundry Detergent, TROJAN, and baking soda. New product launches also contributed to domestic revenue growth year-over-year. One other thing, we also announced 10% price increase in mid-October on our liquid laundry detergent businesses, OXICLEAN Powder, SpinBrush, and dental care products. In each case, we are following the earlier pricing moves by competition. Turning now to international, international posted a 4.3% increase, primarily due to favorable year-over-year foreign exchange rate changes and the impact of Del. Organically, however, the international sales were down slightly due to higher sales in the prior year's third quarter in advance of an announced price increase. International represents approximately 17% to 18% of our full year consolidated sales and earnings. The strengthening dollar will result in lower reported international sales growth in the future. However, we are fortunate that as a US-centric CPG company, the effect of the strengthening dollar will have a lesser effect on us than others in our peer group. Now, Specialty Products. The specialty product business had another great quarter, primarily due to price increases for dairy products and specialty chemicals business. Specialty Products enjoyed higher year-over-year prices in Q3 for most of its product but began lapping price surcharges that began in August of 2007. So, the growth rate for Specialty Products for the past four quarters has been bolstered by year ago price increases that we've now lapped. So, the growth rate for this division is expected to return to our perennial 3% to 4% range in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin, turning now to the margins that are reported, third quarter gross margin was 39.8%. Excluding the $4.3 million charge related to the shutdown of the North Brunswick plant, our gross margin expanded 100 basis points. And remember that the gross margin expansion is net of diesel hedged losses caused by fall in diesel prices as well as significant year-over-year commodity increases. So, very pleased with our gross margin performance in Q3 and also for posting gross margin improvement in each of the first three-quarters of this year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect a healthy expansion of year-over-year gross margins in the fourth quarter and expect those to exceed 100 basis points. Marketing, marketing spend was 12.6% of revenues which is a 60 basis point increase over the prior year spend of 12%. Marketing expense was about $10 million higher for the quarter than year ago and included spending behind the newly acquired Del businesses and behind our new ARM & HAMMER Essential Cleaners, ARM & HAMMER liquid and OXICLEAN powder. And this higher spending is one of the drivers of our organic revenue growth and the success of our new products. Our third quarter spend was about $80 million and we expect to spend above this level in fourth quarter. I'm not going to cover SG&A. SG&A year-over-year was up $14.7 million. The quarter included a $3.5 million charge related to the divestiture of a subsidiary in Spain and last year included a $3.3 million gain on property sale. The balance of the difference, if you adjust for those two items is primarily due to the transition and amortization costs related to the Del acquisition, litigation costs, and also foreign exchange. Again, looking ahead, for the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter SG&A spend to be comparable to Q3 due to higher R&D spending as we continue to invest in new products. Operating profit, the reported operating margin for the quarter was 13.6% compared to 15.3% last year. If we exclude the plant restructuring charge and the pre-tax loss related to the Spain divestiture, you’ll find that operating margins were 14.8% and if you take a similar approach to 2007 third quarter, we're actually up 10 basis points if we adjust last year for the land sale gain in Q3, 2007.  Other income expense is up $2.2 million for the quarter and reflects lower interest expense as both interest rates and our debt levels are lower than a year ago, but this was more than offset by $3 million of foreign exchange losses that impacted the quarter. Next is income taxes. As you can see in the release, our effective rate for the quarter is 34.4% compared to last year's 34.7%. It's important to note that the current and the prior year quarters were both impacted by favorable tax benefits. However, in the current quarter the lower effective tax rate had little effect on earnings per share. Remember that the tax benefit from the Spain divestiture is offset by the pretax loss included in SG&A. So, the underlying tax rate for the quarter was actually 37.4%. We are forecasting an effective rate of approximately 36% for the full year, that's the all-in rate and this also -- this includes not only Spain, all aspects of Spain, but includes the 50 basis points benefit of the reinstatement of the research tax credit which will be recorded in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn to free cash flow and debt, we generated $65 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. Netted in our free cash flow is $27 million of CapEx which included $19 million of expenditures related to the new facility in New York and Pennsylvania. We have 175 million of cash on hand and approximately $195 million of available credit through our revolver and asset securitization facilities. We also converted our 100 million convertible debt in the quarter into 3.2 million shares of the company's stock and we completed the 380 million Orajel acquisition on July 7th, which was financed with a $250 million addition to our bank credit facility as well as some cash. So our total debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA per our bank agreement was approximately 2.0 at quarter end, putting us at the low end of our long-term leverage range of two to three times EBITDA. We expect to generate over $200 million of free cash flow in 2008. And remember that this is after absorbing approximately $43 million of CapEx in the second half of 2008 related to the new plant in York County. In conclusion, the third quarter results reflect 4% organic sales growth, good gross margin expansion, progress in integrating the Del acquisition, continued reinvestment in marketing as well as strong free cash flow. Back to you, Jim.
James Craigie: Hey, thanks Matt. I'd like to spend the remaining few minutes of our portion of the call talking about two subjects. First, the strength of our new product pipeline and its impact on our current and future organic revenue growth, and second my earnings guidance for the rest of 2008. On new product front, we are continuing to see the benefit of a corporate new product team that was created in 2006 to deliver more innovative new products with strong consumer appeal. Last year this group launched over 50 new products which was a record for our company. This year the new product team will launch fewer new products in total but the revenue impact of these new products in the first half of 2008 is over 50% greater. Let me repeat, over 50% greater than the new products launch in the first half of 2007. The new product launch is affecting 2008 sales include the following. A new sub line of our ARM & HAMMER brand called Essentials which provides consumers with environmentally friendly products at a value price versus category leaders. Our first entry in the Essentials line is a liquid laundry detergent product launched in 2006. This product is in a key driver of our total ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent business which has been growing at over 40% compounded rate over the past five years. Over the past two years, we have successfully expanded the ARM & HAMMER Essentials sub line into three other categories, fabric softener sheets, cat litter, and underarm deodorant. In third quarter this year, we expand that line again into a fifth category, household cleaners. This line of cleaners is built on following three simple ideas. First, they include plant based and other biodegradable ingredients that work as well as traditional cleaners. Second, consumers only have to buy a small refill cartridge after the initial purchase which helps reduce the amount of packaging that ends up in landfalls like 52% and third, the consumers save money with refills up to 25% cheaper than the category leaders. In order to help you better understand this product line, think of it as similar to Clorox's Green Works new product line in the [bottle] dispensable cleaners, but without the bottle, without the water, which is about 95% of what's in the bottle, and about 40% cheaper than Green Works. We believe that our line of cleaning products will be very compelling to consumers because it leverages two hot trends. First, providing consumers with environmentally responsible products that work as well as traditional cleaners, and second, providing consumers with a better value. We are supporting this initiative with significant marketing support in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. Now it's too early to judge the retail success of this new line of cleaners but I'll just say that the early results are in line with our expectations. Other significant new products impacting 2008 sales include Arm & Hammer laundry detergent with OXICLEAN stain fighters offered in both powder and liquid form. This new co-branded product delivers premium laundry detergent cleaning performance at a value price. It started shipping in the fourth quarter 2007. It is on track to be our most successful new laundry product ever. All new ARM & HAMMER products are being supported by more appealing and unified packaging, a trademark advertising campaign, and increased levels of marketing spending, almost 50% higher than last year as part of new ARM & HAMMER mega brand marketing campaign that we started in 2006. Since the start of that campaign, net sales of all ARM & HAMMER brands has grown from 1% in 2004 to over 6% in 2007 and over 9% in the first three quarters of this year. We've also launched innovative new products in our other core categories in the first half of 2008 including the following. Two new additions to the TROJAN line called Thintensity and Magnum Thin which capitalize in the growing thin segment of the condom category. A new near depilatory product called Shower Power, which enables women for the first time to use depilatory product in the shower with the majority of women remove hair on their legs. This new product has become the number one new product in depilatory category in 2008.  A new SpinBrush toothbrush called Swirl, a value-oriented product which was designed to encourage manual brush users to trade up into the battery-powered toothbrush category. And finally, the FIRST RESPONSE brand has launched a digital pregnancy kit and a daily ovulation kits that are doing extremely well. Let me switch gears now and talk about the future. While we're pleased with the solid third quarter and year-to-date results, as I often state, we are never satisfied. While the current and future business environment will be extremely challenging, Church & Dwight has a sustainable growth model that will enable us to continue to deliver strong earnings growth. Our eight power brands being ARM & HAMMER, TROJAN, OXICLEAN, FIRST RESPONSE, SpinBrush, Nair, Xtra, and Oraljel are powerful brands representing over 80% of our total net revenues and profit they are all growing in 2008.  This growth is driven by two key factors. First, our improved competency in new product development has generated strong pipeline of new product innovations at every one of our core categories. Second, we've been steadily increasing our marketing spending behind these brands to continue to build equity and deliver or exceed our 3% to 4% organic revenue growth target.  In addition to our strong portfolio of eight power brands, the next major factor driving our sustainable growth model is our ability to deliver solid gross margin improvement and earnings growth despite an unprecedented level of year-to-date cost increases for raw materials, packaging, and transportation. We have a well established pipeline and cost saving initiatives in the areas of manufacturing, purchasing, distribution, and trade spending that is being executed to deliver significant cost savings now and initiatives are already underway to deliver significant cost savings as far as out as 2010. In addition, the strength of our core brands has enabled to us raise prices while still delivering or exceeding our organic revenue growth target and record shares on most of our core brands. In that regard, as Matt stated, we have announced price increases on over 50% of our company's product portfolio so far in 2008. These cost savings and pricing initiatives are being bolstered by manufacturing synergies from the OGI integration, liquid laundry detergent compaction, and volume scale leverage. The net effect of all these initiatives is expected to lead the further steady improvement in our gross margin in Q4, 2008 to deliver our annual average target of at least 100 basis points improvement. In fact, based on our year-to-date results of 130 basis points improvement through the first three quarters of 2008, excluding new plant charges, we will exceed our 100 basis point full year target in 2008. The improvement in our gross margins has enabled to us increase marketing spending in 2008 to drive a strong organic growth. Finally, we will continue to keep a very tight lid on overhead costs as demonstrate by our ability to continue to grow our company's sales while keeping our headcount flat. Now, let me translate into specific guidance for the rest of the year. Our sustainable growth model, which has enabled us to both grow and reinvest at the same time, bodes well for our company and shareholders despite the weakening worldwide economy. In view of our solid organic revenue growth, gross margin improvement and tight overhead expense control, we feel confident that we can deliver our previously announced EPS forecast of $2.83 to $2.85 for 2008, and that's a 15% to 16% increase over 2007. This excludes the previously announced charges for the new manufacturing plant of approximately $0.08 per share. Based on that fact that we have delivered $2.20 EPS in the first three quarters 2008, this means that we expect to deliver between $0.53 to $0.55 of EPS in Q4, which is a 37% to 41% increase versus a year ago. These results reflect continued solid organic revenue growth, a significant increase in gross margins, continued strong marketing spending, in fact marketing spend will be a record for us in fourth quarter behind our innovative new products and tight control of SG&A costs. Now that ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to questions that you may have which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Chantal, please go ahead.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Hi. I'm confused about something. Your guidance includes or excludes the $0.08?
Matt Farrelll: The $2.83 to $2.85?
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Yeah.
Matt Farrelll: Yeah, that excludes.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay. And was there inventory write-up associated with Orajel in the third quarter?
Matt Farrelll: Yes, it’s customary with any of our acquisitions. We always write-up the inventory to fair value, so that would have impacted the third quarter margins and earnings contributed by Del.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: How much was that as a cost in -- cost of goods sold?
Matt Farrelll: We typically don't go to that level of detail, Alice.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Well, I had estimated $0.03, does that sound right?
Matt Farrelll: As I said, we typically don't get into that level of detail on the brands. As you know, our histories, we don't quote sales or earnings by brand.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: All right. Raw material costs have come down, does that in your outlook for '09 -- does the benefit of lower raw material costs that you might have expected a couple of months ago, is it offset with any new negative versus what you might have thought a couple months ago?
Matt Farrelll: I think with respect to '09, you see anybody who read the release will see that we have our evergreen targets of 3% to 4% top line growth on a basis point to gross margin expansion of $0.60, $0.70 of up margin. We are aware of what's going on with respect to commodities. But like so many other companies, commodities for us were peaking in Q3 and in Q4. So, not all of them are actually coming down that quickly. We don't expect the benefits to begin to accrue to us until the late Q1 of 2009. So that were – so, it's based on our most current information, is why we are confident that we can hit our evergreen targets in '09.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: I guess that's it. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of Suntrust.
Bill Chappell - Suntrust:  To go back to your comments after the second quarter call. I think you originally said that 4Q was going to be a bigger EPS quarter than 3Q, due to the timing of marketing. I mean should we just look at this as shift of marketing from 3Q to 4Q or was there something else going on in the guidance?
Matt Farrelll: No. There are a lot of variables obviously that go into calling what Q3 and Q4 would be for the full year. Yes, you are right. When we came out at the end of Q2, we said that, we expected marketing expenses to be 13% of sales, Bill. We came in at 12.6. You probably know, we time our marketing to the extent that we hit certain distribution targets for our new product, suppose we have our new Essentials cleaner that's going out as well, more or so in the fourth quarter than third quarter. So, yeah, there's a shift in marketing spend from Q3 to Q4. That's a piece of it.
Bill Chappell - Suntrust: But it still sounds like the quarter came in a little bit ahead of your expectations.
Matt Farrelll: Well, we had a really good quarter. Keep in mind, we had to take a few hits along the way with respect to FX losses as well as the diesel losses. It was a good quarter for us. But given the uncertain environment that we're in right now, obviously, we'd be confident that we can hit the full year number, but we don't think it's prudent to go and start changing full year guidance.
Bill Chappell - Suntrust: Sticking on the marketing theme with the rollout of all the new products, was there trade promotion or couponing that impacted net sales, and was it meaningful?
Matt Farrelll: I mean look every quarter there's a significant amount of promotion and couponing. I will say slotting is something that that we often get questions on. Slotting was slightly higher this year than last year. With respect to couponing, that's not a big factor for us. We're not big in coupons.
Bill Chappell - Suntrust: Okay. Just trying to understand 2Q versus 3Q. If last quarter hit 8% organic growth and 3% volume growth this quarter, 4% organic growth and no volume growth, but you say you are seeing consumers start to trade down. So I am just trying to understand if it is just tougher year-over-year comparisons or is there something else going on?
Matt Farrelll: When you think about the second quarter, Bill, one thing to remember is that we had huge growth on the part of the specialty product business. So, if you went back and say what was your organic growth for specialty product in the first couple quarters of the year, it was both 19% to 20% or higher in Q1 and Q2. Q3 is 14% and Q4, as I said will be back down to earth organically. So, we have the deceleration of the add? from specialty products going from Q2 to Q3. I would say in that 8% number you quoted for the second quarter, it's about a point and a half for that. So that would say the consumer business worldwide was 6.5% in the second quarter. And we had lots of things were going out in the first quarter that helped us so we got some new distribution, we had new product launches, and we had some lower slotting year-over-year because we knew it'd be higher in the second half particularly fourth quarter year-over-year. So, if you adjust for those, you still -- you get consumer business more down to in the 4% range.
Bill Chappell - Suntrust: Okay.
Matt Farrelll: And with respect to volume versus price, the domestic business is still rock along pretty well. I guess the domestic business is half volume and half price. It's the other businesses international and SPD that caused us to say that of the 4% organic growth most of it is price. That's because for those other businesses, international, SPD, it's way more skewed toward price than volume.
Bill Chappell - Suntrust: Okay, that makes much more sense. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Lane of Jefferies & Company.
Douglas Lane - Jefferies & Company: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
Jim Craigie: Good morning.
Douglas Lane - Jefferies & Company: Just a follow-up on Bill's question, I mean, you can interpret your outlook for the fourth quarter today to be a little bit more cautious than it was at the second quarter given the third quarter upside plus it sounds like the Orajel contribution is going to be more than you originally thought. Is there almost flipside something in the fourth quarter that is maybe working against you now that was not quite so -- wasn't quite the case the second quarter release?
Matt Farrelll: No I wouldn't interpret the fact that we're at 50 or, pardon me, $0.73 versus $0.69 and not taking up the year as any kind of signal other than what we said before is that we did have far or less marketing spend in Q3 than we expected. So obviously, we expect to spend that in Q4.
Douglas Lane - Jefferies & Company: Okay. That makes sense. With the currencies, I know you don't have a big international presence, but can you just give us a brief on what the key currencies are and without getting into specifics just what do you think the currency impact will be to your sales and EPS next year if we stay where we are at today?
Jim Craigie: Yeah. Sure everybody is listening very closely to my call on currencies for '09. Here's the way to think about. We have four core markets, Canada, UK, France, and Mexico. So obviously anybody that's on the call can compare the spot rates today to the average rates in the first nine months of the year. There would be around 15% change. But I think we come back to the point that it's hard to call 2009 rates right now. We're fortunate that we're US-centric and so we have far less concern than some of the competitors with respect to what kind of impact that's going to have.
Douglas Lane - Jefferies & Company: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Have you seen distribution gains with some of the value laundry product because of the softening consumer environment?
Jim Craigie: Nothing like that. Bill, not really. Glad you asked. Let me try to give you some facts on two issues. One, I call trading down, and the other private label. Obviously, everybody knows what's going on in the economy. We are seeing consumers trading down and as you know about 30% of our portfolio is a value for us versus competitors particularly laundry detergent, liquid and powder. We also have value toothpaste business, we also have valued pregnancy kit business and our cleaners business such as in new ARM & HAMMER Essentials line is a value and we are seeing good growth in those businesses, particularly the laundry side of the business is seeing good growth, but also the other ones that are seeing; laundry business is over 10% growth in this quarter and the other businesses are all seeing high single-digit growth. So, in those businesses ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent half the price of Tide, we are seeing a benefit consumers rating down. There in private label, yes, you are all hearing private label is growing but the honest truth to us is private label for the most part is not a threat to us. If you were to look at all outlet shares for private label, in the majority of the categories we competed, private label is very small. Just give you some hard core – hard numbers, private label liquid laundry is less than a five share of the total market. Powdered laundry, less than a three share. Stain fighters category as we call OXICLEAN is less than two share. Carpet Deo about two share, toothpaste, private label is less than a 1 share. Battery-powered toothbrush, private label about a two share and then in condoms, depilatories, underarm deodorant, private labels all less than a 1 share. So, on those businesses, we don't really worry about private label and if you hear private label in those categories is growing double-digits, my answer to that is, big deal, we don't care. Now private label is a bigger threat in some of the -- couple of categories we are in. Two we worry about most are cat litter and pregnancy kits. Private label is about a 15 share of cat litter and about 30 share of pregnancy kits. But in both those categories, our business is doing exceptionally well. We've had share growth now for nine straight quarters in cat litter and then pregnancy kits, we've gone from number two brand and number one brand over the last two years and in both cases we are having very strong share growth, so the private label threat there is not big to us. Private label is a player in three other categories that are relatively small to us. That's fabric softener sheets and baking soda and household cleaners but those are businesses where our share is up in fabric softener sheets and up and doing well in cleaners with our new Essentials launch, and baking soda, we're about an 80 share, so we lose a point to private label because of pricing we took, it's not a big threat. So, the overall, I give you a lot of facts there but the bottom line is we are going to see consumers trading down. For the most part, we are benefiting from that, from our value parts of our portfolio and the private label threat is pretty, I wouldn't say nonexistent but a very small threat to us overall.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, great. And then for '09 guidance, I think you said in line with your long-term shareholder return model so because you have Orajel coming through, does that mean we should look for 12% to 15% next year even with the currency hit?
Matt Farrelll: No. we're gong to get – no we're we are going to give specific guidance in the first week of Feb like we always do, but right now, it's too early to start calling numbers. That's not our practice.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, just because in the press release it says '09 should be in line with long-term plan.
Matt Farrelll: Our long-term perennial goals are the three we stated.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. Got you. All right, that makes sense. And there is there going to be any mix impact to gross margin as you look at some of the categories that are slowing? It’s sort of high margin OXICLEAN. Even on the condom side price has been great, but volume is pretty much flat which actually kind of surprises me because I didn't think that was a very elastic category. So what happens on the mix side of things, because I think the laundry detergent business is lower gross margin than the fleet average and that should grow faster than some of these newer to higher margin products.
Matt Farrelll: It is true that personal care products have a higher gross margin than households. So to the extent that the mix changes, yeah, that could have an impact on gross margin. But the good news for us is that our household margins, particularly, in laundry have been growing significantly over the past couple years particularly with respect to concentration. So, that should mute any effect that would have on it.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. And then just one more, I am sorry to keep going on this. But if you look at liquid laundry detergent business at 10% price increase and sort of a de facto 10% price increase from compaction. That's sort of like a 20% price increase. Are you seeing a lot of pantry de-loading now and will that catch up at some point? Because I think just probably initial kind of shock value to the list price and then people have to start to buy again later, but right now is there any pantry loading going on?
Jim Craigie: Now Bill, we were watching that. Honestly, we really haven't seen much that I know some competitors have talked about that. But maybe they are more sophisticated, but I don't know. But we have not seen that. Our business continues to do very well.
Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella of JPMorgan.
Mili Seoni - JPMorgan: Hi. This is Mili Seoni for Carla Casella. Could you provide an estimate for your cash contributions to the pension plans for next year?
Matt Farrelll: Well, that's something that we'll be looking at in the fourth quarter, like many companies certainly the market has had an impact on the gap between our fair market wherever our assets and our liability. So, we're looking at that right now, but given the amount of cash flow that the company generates, I don't expect that that's going to be a material amount to the company.
Mili Seoni - JPMorgan: That's great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jim Craigie: Hi, Joe.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: First question. In terms of the price increases you guys taking in 4Q, did you see any pre-buying ahead of that in the third quarter? 
Jim Craigie: No.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Nothing meaningful?
Jim Craigie: Nothing.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Okay. Secondly, in terms of the essentials household cleaners’ line, how is that doing relative to expectations in terms of sales and distribution?
Jim Craigie: It is right in line with our expectations. We started shaping that product in Q3. October was really the first big month of trial efforts and strong advertising. And we don't know the results from there yet. But everything we've seen so far is in line with our expectations and we have somewhat conservative expectations for that, but that everything is going well so far.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then, lastly, in terms of the acquisitions you mentioned, Jim, earlier that you are at the low end of your leverage range at this point and I would probably guess you want to integrate Orajel before you do anything sizable, but what's your attitude right now in terms of doing another deal at some point?
Jim Craigie: Joe, we're ready to do a deal anytime. As Matt told that we have a strong cash position. We have strong credit lines out there. I would tell you the market is very active. We're very active in looking. And we would make a deal tomorrow if there was a good one out there. So I’d say, through the market is,? there are some people out there who don't have the cash that maybe we have. So we're not going to wait till Orajel is integrated later next year to make another deal. I don't have one today, but we're not waiting for that to finish.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: When you say it's active, it sounds like there are a lot of properties for sale, but in terms of valuations have they pulled back?
Matt Farrelll: Not really. Not from what we've seen. I got nothing specific, but I would say there has not been a major change in valuation.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: What were the annual sales of the Spanish subsidiary so we can model it?
Matt Farrelll: It's about $9 million.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: So, okay, it's really minor.
Matt Farrelll: Yeah, it's small.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Did it always operate at a loss?
Matt Farrelll: Well, always is a long time, Connie. It was operating at a small operating loss over the past year and a half.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Why do you have an FX loss in the quarter? Where did that come from?
Matt Farrelll: It came from inter-company receivables, payables that we have between certain countries. Those get treated as transaction losses.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. So that's transaction loss. Okay. And the size of your international business, with all the parts and between the international consumer and the international part of specialty, is that about $600 million in total?
Matt Farrelll: Well, we -- what you would do, is you just take international business and you would add a portion of that for international piece of specialty product.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: So it's something like 20% to 25% of total sales? Would that be about right?
Jim Craigie: No, we say no.
Matt Farrelll: No, no, no. No, it would be nowhere near that big. Remember, 17% for international business. And I think you’ll probably add around $80 million of that to come up with the combined international and SPD.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, so the specialty international is around 80 million?
Matt Farrelll: Yeah.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Would you expect there then to be -- if the change in currency, does it affect you more on the top line or more on the bottom line because of transaction impact as well?
Matt Farrelll: Well, on the top line, as I said before, with 17% of the company, all things being equal, if you translate the P&L, so you're going to have an impact, if you have a 15% change, you'd have 50% down top line as well as earnings. Those also with respect to transaction, you could have some of that too to the extent that you are manufacturing this in the US for other entities, but we always have the option of co-packing locally to overcome that.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: So, do you think that you'll be able to overcome the transaction impact? Is that the plan?
Matt Farrelll: We feel confident about '09 as we said in the release with respect to hitting our perennial targets. So, if we say 100 basis points of gross margin expansion that would include the impact of currency as well as commodities.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: So the impact on the top line in the fourth quarter, let's say of the change in the dollar, would that be something on the order of dampening the sales growth by about 2%?
Matt Farrelll: I think it could be that high, Con. You're going to have to make your own guess with respect to where currencies are going to be.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. But assuming they stay where they are right now.
Matt Farrelll: It could be that high.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And that would be, assuming…
Matt Farrelll: That's on reported, remember.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Sorry?
Matt Farrelll: That's on reported.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Right.
Matt Farrelll: Right, yeah.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: And assuming they stay where they are then that would be 2% to 2.5% increase for the next three quarters as well?
Matt Farrelll: Did you say increase?
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Dampening, sorry.
Matt Farrelll: I mean look, if Q4 stays where it is right now, it's just math and so it's, yeah, it could be up to 2% and that would obviously impact our reported numbers in the similar fashion in '09.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And my final question is on ARM & HAMMER Essentials cleaners, are they -- how are these things shown in the store? Are they being all -- do you have end caps? Do consumers see them as a block of product, so are they scattered through the separate categories?
Matt Farrelll: It varies by store retailer, Connie. In some cases they block together, we definitely had end cap displays and so it varies just like it would for any other brand.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Is Wal-Mart doing a brown block on these?
Matt Farrelll: I'm not sure what the brown block is but Wal-Mart has done very significant merchandising support for this including displays and trial offers and everything. It's been a very strong supporter of this new product line.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.
Matt Farrelll: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of UBS.
Nik Modi - UBS: Just two quick questions. Just generally in October, have you seen any noticeable changes in just the consumer dynamics out there?
Jim Craigie: Not yet.
Nik Modi - UBS: Not yet, okay. Second question, assuming diesel stays where it is, I mean should we be looking at any diesel losses in the fourth quarter or are the hedges over?
Matt Farrelll: The change in diesel obviously will be measured from October 1 through December 31st, so yes, to the extent there was a change there that will be a P&L effect.
Nik Modi - UBS: Okay. Great. Thanks so much guys. That's it for me. 
Matt Farrelll: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of Wachovia.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Hey guys.
Matt Farrelll: Hey Jason.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Hey. Just a question about the innovation pipeline for next year, I mean this year you were saying you did fewer but bigger products and I guess just thinking about the consumer environment and the appetite out there, can you just talk about may be your risk appetite with new products and just some color around that?
Jim Craigie: I think about the same, Jason. We're going to continue on the theme of fewer but bigger new products in the future. So, you will probably see about the same number of new products launched next year as we launched this year. We're obviously will focus continue on our core categories to do that with and so far we feel based on the results this year which I said, our new products this year are delivering 50% more revenue than our product the year before. So, we like that fewer and bigger strategy and that's where we're going to continue into 2009 and 2010.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Okay. Then just changing topics here, just in terms of the pricing that you are taking this quarter, I might have missed this earlier on the call. I mean can you talk about your outlook? How much of that do you anticipate will stick in this marketplace? Any conversations with retailers, is it too early to kind of talk about, when you might see either a little bit more gross to net spending on the promotion side to kind of just factoring into a softer commodity environment that's going through?
Matt Farrelll: Jason, you hit the nail on the head. It's one thing to take price increases. The other thing is the actions of competitors are unpredictable as is the, what is going to be the reaction of the consumer. So, will we see consumption decline, and will they need to be stimulated by trade promotions. So yes, all of the above are going to have to be factored into what happens in the future, so hard to call right now.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Okay.
Jim Craigie: I would just say to you. We have announced it, consumers have accepted it, the prices will be reflect at retail over the course of Q4, and we certainly don't intend to do anything to unravel it at this point.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Okay. And did you quantify I guess on the liquid laundry, how much of your gains might have come from lagging behind, I guess, some of your competitors in terms of taking the pricing?
Matt Farrelll: No, we haven't quantified that.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Okay. So I won't push. Last question. I guess with the tax credit that just got implemented, how should we think about for next year? How big or how much could that impact your tax rate for 2009?
Matt Farrelll: Well, the impact on 2008, Jason, is 50 basis points.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Okay. So, it should be similar for next year as well?
Matt Farrelll: Yeah, it doesn't vary too much from year-to-year.
Jason Gere - Wachovia: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Jim Craigie: Thank you.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Andrew Sawyer of Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Yeah, sure. Hey, guys.
Jim Craigie: Good morning.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: I was just hoping to get two quick ones. One, I was just wondering if you could you help us a little bit with how we should think about the phasing in of compaction benefits in '08 versus '09. I know you completed the rollout in the middle of this year, but you also had some start-up costs. Should we get -- are the savings bigger '09 versus '08 or how can we think about that?
Matt Farrelll: There is actually some benefit in '09. Remember that the whole country was completely converted after the third wave, which started in April and probably completed sometime late June or early July. So on a year-over-year basis, there will be some help in the first half of '09, but not in the second half.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Were there some start-up costs in the first half of '08 as well?
Matt Farrelll: There's always start-up costs with a changeover like that, but we've never quantified them. So, obviously that will be gone as well, first half '08 versus first half '09.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: A second one, you guys have talked a bit about some of your more discretionary categories whether it's power toothbrush, OXICLEAN and I heard you mentioned you're launching a lower priced option on the power toothbrush. Are there other things like that we're going to see in some of those categories to help sustain consumption if you view the consumer spending continues to get worse?
Jim Craigie: I mean we have had a very strong focus on value part of our portfolio and in categories that we have premium production, like battery powered toothbrushes in that. We have launched more value-oriented new production and you, probably, will see that. The ARM & HAMMER Essentials cleaners’ line is other great example. We've launched that new line. It’s a great new product and [worth] as well as the leading brands, but it's environmentally based. And when you buy the refills, it's 25% cheaper than the leading brands. So we think it's a very smart strategy in this environment where the consumers are getting increasingly value-oriented. You'll see that from their panel changes and changing from the traditional retailers out there to the mass merchant channel. We think that's a wave that's going to happen for a pretty considerable time in the future. And you are going to see probably a good number of our new products that has strong orientation to our value.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Anything on the OXICLEAN side and I know you talked about laundry additives as a category where you feel like you have some discretionary exposure?
Jim Craigie: Nothing particularly in OXICLEAN additive. That is probably one of the most loyal from of all of our good businesses and we don't have anything in mind to my knowledge in line for a value offering on that business.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much guys.
Jim Craigie: Thank you everyone for taking the time today to talk to us the. Again, we're very proud of our Q3 results. We reaffirm our projection for the rest of the year and we're looking forward to very difficult 2009 business environment to continue to deliver the kind of business results we have in the past. If you have any questions, please give myself or Matt a call later today or whenever we end up. We thank you again. Goodbye.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-04 10:00:00) =====

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. James Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Church & Dwight; please go ahead sir.
James Craigie: Good morning everyone. It’s always a pleasure to talk to you particularly when we have good results to report. Let me start off by saying that I’m very proud of my team as I doubt that few consumer packages companies will match both the quality and magnitude of our second quarter and first half of 2008 results. These results reflect an organization that is highly motivated and firing on all cylinders. Our new product pipeline and increased marketing spending is driving strong organic growth. Our business teams and supply chain organization are working closely together to deliver exceptional gross margin expansion despite a dramatic rise in commodity prices in 2008.  Everyone is continuing to keep a tight rein on overhead costs as proven by the fact that we have the same number of employees today as we had four years ago, despite a 50% increase in sales during that time. We are squeezing every dollar out of our working capital to drive a significant increase in cash flow. That increased cash flow and strong balance sheet is enabling us to smartly invest in our future through accretive bolt-on acquisitions and building new plants to further lower our cost structure and strengthen our competitive advantage. While we are feeling bullish about our company’s business momentum we are very cognizant of the very tough business environment facing all companies these days. Consumer confidence is at a record low and consumers are trading down as shown by the growth in private label. We believe that consumer spending is going to get worse before it gets better. However Church & Dwight has handled this crisis exceptionally well so far as demonstrated by our strong organic growth and gross margin expansion. No other consumer packages company that I can think of is as well suited to handle a recession as Church & Dwight. Over 30% of our domestic portfolio consists of value oriented products. We’ve also just launched a major new product line that leverages two hot consumer trends; value and green. I’ll talk more about this in a moment. Finally we have a superb plan in place to deliver on our goal of growing gross margin by at least 100 basis points per year. We promised that result for 2008 when oil was less than $100 per barrel. We will still deliver on our objective despite higher oil prices. Now you may wonder how Church & Dwight can still do this when most other consumer packages companies are not able to grow gross margin.  The answer is that Church & Dwight have four key factors driving gross margin. The first two are common to other consumer packages companies in that we have taken pricing, in our case we priced over 30% of revenue base and I assume that other CPG companies have also have basic productivity programs in place to cut costs wherever possible.  On top of those two common industry factors, Church & Dwight have two unique factors. First the compaction of liquid laundry detergent products which started in September of 2007 and finished its national rollout in June of this year has generated significant cost savings that have more than offset the cost increases in this commodity sensitive business. Second we have $10 million in manufacturing cost synergies starting last October from the integration from the acquired OGI brands in to our manufacturing facility. Not only do we have these four factors driving gross margin expansion but when commodity prices started to rise dramatically in early 2008 we exceeded our assumptions on all four factors through an extraordinary effort by the whole Church & Dwight organization. In this regard we took more pricing then originally forecasted, we achieved more cost savings then we expected, the laundry compaction conversion went better than expected, and we exceeded the cost savings from the manufacturing synergies on the integration of the acquisition. When you combine this incredible effort on cost savings with the great pipeline of new products, increased marketing spending, tight overhead controls, and squeezing working capital, you get the high quality business results achieved by Church & Dwight in the second quarter of 2008; 8% organic revenue growth, 110 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% increase in net income, and 82% increase in cash flow.  These results are not surprising to us as we expect to continue delivering solid organic revenue growth at the high end of our long-term goal of 3% to 4% and gross margin expansion of at least 100 basis points annually. I’ll provide more details in my outlook for the year in a few minutes. I’ll now turn the call over Matt Farrelll, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide you with greater insight in the financial results of the second quarter and first half of 2008.
Matt Farrell: Thank you James, good morning everybody and I’ll start with the headlines as James mentioned. Second quarter EPS was $0.66 per share compared with $0.59 in 2007 and a strong sales performance in gross margin expansion were the drivers of our second quarter earnings results. Revenue is up 8.7% of which 1.5% was due to currency. We had some offsets there to net it down to 8% organic growth. Of the 8% growth approximately 3% was due to volume and another 5% due to price and mix. The pipeline for new products as well as expanded distribution on existing products also helped the quarter by approximately 2% of that 8%. Now let’s briefly review the segments, the domestic business had a strong quarter. Revenue is up 7.4% led by Xtra liquid laundry, Arm & Hammer liquid laundry, First Response, Arm & Hammer powdered laundry detergent and Arm & Hammer Super Scoop cat litter. We successfully raised prices in May for Arm & Hammer powdered laundry detergent and Nice and Fluffy liquid fabric softener as in February for Trojan, as well as baking soda. New product launches also contributed to the domestic revenue growth. Now the international division, international posted 3% organic growth as this segment performed well in many countries. The specialty products business had an exceptional quarter primarily due to price increases for our dairy products and the specialty chemicals business. The specialty products business enjoyed higher year-over-year prices in Q2 for virtually its entire portfolio of products. Now we’ll look at gross margin, our second quarter gross margin was 40.8%, that’s an 110 basis point expansion versus last year and we’re very pleased with this result despite significant commodity increases in packing in the business. As James said we have four levers that contributed to the margin expansion, cost reduction programs, pricing, OGI manufacturing synergies and the benefits of concentration of liquid laundry.  The cost reduction programs include product reformulations, plant automation, more sophisticated forward buying, and optimization of trade spending just to name a few. The price increases we have taken thus far this year began to impact gross margin in the second quarter and we will continue to access additional pricing actions on products as commodity prices continue to rise.  We are pleased with the progress we have made in the transition of concentrated laundry products and the benefits this is providing to gross margin. These levers serve to offset higher input costs for resin, corrugated paper, liner board, diesel fuel and many others. So we are delighted with our gross margin performance in this past quarter. Now looking ahead, and excluding the plant charges that I’m sure you’re all familiar with, we continue to expect a healthy expansion of year-over-year gross margin in both Q3 and Q4.  Now on to marketing, the marketing spend was 13.3% of revenues which is 120 basis points higher then the prior year spend of 12.1%. Our marketing expense was about $13.1 million higher for the quarter than year ago. This higher spending is the key driver of our organic revenue growth along with our innovative new products which James will talk about in a few minutes.  Our second quarter spend was about $80 million and we expect to continue to spend at or above this level in the remaining quarters. So we are targeting marketing spend to be about 13% of sales for the second half of 2008. SG&A is next, SG&A year-over-year was $7.4 million due to foreign currency changes, higher R&D and investment in information systems. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 13.7% in Q2 which is up from a year ago. Looking ahead we expect third quarter SG&A as a percentage of sales to be comparable to Q2 due to higher R&D spending as we continue to invest in new products. Remember also that the third and fourth quarter will also include integration costs for the Orajel acquisition that will be hitting the SG&A line. Operating margin for the quarter was 13.8% compared to 14% last year. Other income and expense reflects lower interest expenses both interest rates and our debt levels are lower than a year ago. Next is income taxes, as you can see in the release our effective rate for the quarter is 39.3% compared to last year’s 38.7%. The current and prior year quarters were both impacted by an increase in tax reserves.  The underlying tax rate for the quarter was 36.1%. We are forecasting an effective rate of approximately 37% for the full year. EPS is $0.66, a 12% increase over the prior year and finally free cash flow, we generated $57 million of free cash flow in the second quarter and ended the quarter with $256 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our total debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA per our bank agreement was approximately 1.8 at quarter end. We also recently called our $100 million convertible debt which will convert by the middle of August, August 15th.  We completed a $380 million Orajel acquisition on July 7th. The purchase price was financed with a $250 million addition to our bank credit facility as well as available cash. Now post the Orajel acquisition and after converting the debt our total debt to LTM EBITDA is expected to be approximately 2.2 in sometime in August, putting us at the lower end of our long-term leverage range of two to three times EBITDA. So in conclusion the short summary for the second quarter would be 8% organic sales growth, good gross margin expansion, continued reinvestment in marketing, and strong free cash flow. Now back to James. 
James Craigie: Thanks Matt, I’d like to spend the remaining few minutes of our portion of the call talking about two subjects. First the strength of our new product pipeline and its impact on our current and future organic revenue growth, second my earnings guidance for the rest of 2008.  On the new product front we are continuing to see the benefit of a corporate new product team that was created in 2006 to deliver more innovative consumer products with strong consumer appeal. Last year this group launched over 50 new products; a record for our company. This year the new product team will launch significantly fewer products in total but the revenue impact of these new products in the first half of 2008 is over 30% greater then the new products launched in the first half of 2007. The new product launches effecting 2008 sales include the following.  A new sub line of Arm & Hammer called Essentials, which provide consumers with environmentally friendly products at a value price versus category leaders. Our first entry in the Essential line was a liquid laundry detergent product launched in 2006. This product continues to deliver impressive growth and now represents approximately 10% of our total Arm & Hammer liquid laundry detergent business which has been growing at over a 14% compounded rate over the past five years.  Over the past two years we’ve expanded the Arm & Hammer Essentials sub line into three other categories; fabric softener sheets, cat litter and underarm deodorants. In total the Essentials line is projected to do over $40 million in sales this year across those four categories. And we expect continued strong growth in future years as this line leverages two hot consumer trends; being green and offering value versus category leaders. Other significant new products impacting 2008 sales include Arm & Hammer laundry detergent with Oxi Clean stain fighters offered in both powder and liquid form. This new cold [inaudible] product delivers premium laundry detergent cleaning performance at a value price. It started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2007, and is on track to be one of our most successful new laundry products. As I mentioned earlier these new Arm & Hammer products are being supported by more appealing and unified packaging, a trademark advertising campaign, and increased levels of marketing spending; almost 50% higher than last year as part of the new Arm & Hammer mega brand marketing campaign that we started in 2006.  Since the start of this campaign net sales have grown for all Arm & Hammer brands from 1% in 2004 to over 6% in 2007 and over 9% in the first half of this year. We’ve also launched innovative new products in our other core categories in the first half of 2008 including two new additions to the Trojan line, called Intensity and Magnum Thin, which capitalize on the growing thin segment in the condom category. A new Nair depilatory product called Shower Power which enables women for the first time to use a depilatory product in the shower where the majority of women remove hair on their legs. This has become the number one new product in depilatory category in 2008. A new spin brush toothbrush called Swirl, a value oriented product which is designed to encourage manual brush users to trade up into the battery powered toothbrush category.  And finally the First Response brand has launched an additional pregnancy kit and a daily ovulation kit. In the second half of 2008 I’m pleased to announce a major new initiative. We are expanding the Arm & Hammer Essentials line into the household cleaners’ category. This line of cleaners is built on three simple ideas. First they include plant based and other biodegradable ingredients that work as well as traditional cleaners. Second consumers only have to buy a small refill cartridge after the initial purchase which helps reduce the amount of packaging that ends up in landfills by 62%. And third they save consumers money with refills, up to 25% cheaper then the category leaders.  In order to help you better understand this product line, this of it as similar to Clorox Greenworks new product line and environmentally sensitive cleaners but without the bottle, without the water which is 95% of what’s in their bottles, and about a 40% cheaper price. We think that our line of cleaning products will be very compelling to consumers because it leverages those two hot trends; providing consumers with environmentally responsible products that work as well as traditional cleaners and providing consumers with a better value. We plan on supporting this initiative with significant marketing support starting in the third quarter of 2008. Now let me switch gears and talk about the future. While we are pleased with our solid second quarter and first half of 2088 results, as I often state we are never satisfied. While the current and future business environment will be extremely challenging Church & Dwight has a sustainable growth model that will enable us to continue to deliver strong earnings growth. Our eight core brands; Arm & Hammer, Xtra, Trojan, Oxi Clean, First Response, Spin Brush, Nair and Orajel are all powerful brands representing over 80% of our total net revenues and profits and are all achieving strong growth in 2008. This growth is driven by two key factors. First our improved competency in new product development has generated a strong pipeline of new product innovations in every one of our core categories. Second we’ve been steadily increasing our marketing spending behind these brands to continue to build equity and deliver or exceed our 3% to 4% organic revenue growth target.  In addition to our strong portfolio leading brandings the next major factor driving our sustainable growth model is our ability to deliver solid gross margin improvement and earnings growth despite an unprecedented level of cost increases for raw materials, packaging and transportation. We have a well established pipeline of cost saving initiatives in the areas of manufacturing, purchasing, distribution and trade spending that is being executed to deliver significant cost savings now and initiatives are already underway to deliver significant savings as far out as 2010. In addition the strength of our core brands has enabled us to raise prices while still delivering or exceeding our organic revenue growth target and achieving record shares on most of our core brands. In that regard we’ve already announced price increases on about 30% of our company’s product portfolio so far in 2008. In addition we are currently considering price increases in other categories such as laundry detergent, toothpaste and cat litter in order to remain competitive in those categories. These cost savings and pricing initiatives have been bolstered by manufacturing synergies from the OGI integration, liquid laundry detergent compaction, and volume scale leverage. The net affect of all these initiatives is expect to lead the further steady improvement in our gross margin throughout 2008 to deliver our target of at least 100 basis point improvement versus 2007. This improvement in our gross margin will also enable us to increase marketing spending in 2008 and future years. Finally we’re keeping a very tight lid on overhead costs as demonstrated by our ability to keep total headcount flat over the past four years despite a 50% increase in our revenues.  Now let me translate this into specific guidance for the rest of this year. Our sustainable growth model which enables us to both grow and reinvest at the same time bodes well for our company and shareholders. In view of our solid organic revenue growth, gross margin improvement and tight overhead expense control, we now feel confident that we can increase our previously mentioned EPS forecast of $2.77 to a range of $2.83 to $2.85 for this year; a 15% to 16% increase over 2007 despite a significant increase in commodity and energy costs in 2008. This excludes the charges for the new manufacturing plant which was previously announced from approximately $0.08 per share. We also expect second half earnings to be much more evenly balanced then prior years excluding the impact of the Del acquisition. To be specific we expect that the third quarter EPS will be slightly below the fourth quarter and year ago as we will significantly increase marketing spending in the third quarter particularly behind the new Arm & Hammer Essentials cleaners’ line and we have the previously announced one-time step-up charges for the Del acquisition in the third quarter. The fourth quarter will be significantly above year ago due to lower SG&A costs and the positive accretion from the Del acquisition. That ends our presentation and I’ll now open the call to any questions that you may have. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of William Chappel – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
William Chappel – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: I was certainly impressed on the gross margin guidance and EPS guidance but can you tell us how much of that is just the core business and how much of that comes from Orajel? I guess Orajel does have higher gross margins to start with, but I’m not really sure how the inventory write-up impacts the gross margins on the full year and on the EPS I guess you funneled it a little bit different then originally thought. 
Matt Farrell: We’re not going to get that much help in the third quarter. As far as the third quarter goes for gross margin and when we talk about gross margin we’re talking about excluding the plant charges, keep it simple. Remember the $0.08 that’s going to be running through the income statement in the second half $0.04 in Q3, and $0.04 in Q4, so we would expect Q3 gross margins to expand at a rate approaching the Q2 expansion rate and that would be including Del. So Del is actually going to be a drag on Q3 and some help in Q4.  The second thing that impacts Q3 gross margin expansion is we’re expanding into cleaners with Essentials so we will have higher slotting actually in the second half of 2008 then the second half of 2007. So half to half year-over-year, 2008 is higher then 2007. 
William Chappel – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: You still were comfortable getting the legacy business to have gross margin expansion excluding Del? 
Matt Farrell: Absolutely, the legacy business which is the core business is what’s driving the gross margin expansion this year. We’re not going to get a whole lot of help in Q3 and we’re certainly not counting on it to hit our target for the full year of being over 100 basis points. 
William Chappel – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Regarding consumer trade down, is that a big part of your business right now? Is it driving volume or are you seeing consumers even trade down further to private label in some of the categories, where do we stand in that cycle? 
James Craigie: We are seeing let’s call it the recession impacting some premium priced and discretionary categories. We’re seeing some category weakness in categories like battery powered toothbrushes, pregnancy kits, depilatories and carpet deodorization. But in all four cases we’re growing shares in those categories that more than offset the category weakness and then keep in mind that we have a very strong value position in other key categories that we’re benefiting from being the value laundry detergent which is our biggest business. We also have a pregnancy kit that’s a value kit called, brand called Answer that’s delivering double-digit growth. And we have value toothpaste business that’s doing very well.  Private label is a bit of a concern, it is growing in some categories, like liquid laundry detergent, cat litter and pregnancy kits. But again we’re growing in all those cases. We’ve just hit our seventh consecutive quarter of share growth in cat litter to record shares. Pregnancy kits are hitting a record share. We’re experiencing double-digit growth of liquid and powder, the powder laundry detergent is really taking off right now I think due to some consumer reaction to compaction on that and we’re delivering some exceptional growth in that category. So we’re watching it closely. We do see some trade down but in all cases our businesses are doing exceptionally well and more then offsetting that trade down and we expect that to continue. 
William Chappel – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: On pricing, I heard that P&G is going to move forward with some liquid laundry to price increases, is there any reason you wouldn’t follow that? 
James Craigie: We’re in the process of looking at that but I can’t imagine why not. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley – Buckingham Research
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: I’m looking for a breakout of that 8% organic growth, the 5% price mix, what’s price and what’s mix in there? 
Matt Farrell: We haven’t historically broken that out so price and mix we lump in together but suffice it to say that price would be larger than mix. 
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Then the pipeline you said was 2% is that all that Arm & Hammer Essentials home cleaning products? 
Matt Farrell: No, that’s more of a second half. Some of the other products that James talked about like Shower Power for example would be some of the new things—digital as well as for our pregnancy kits. 
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Could you tell me more about this Arm & Hammer Essentials household cleaner, it sounds like its something you have to mix as a consumer, is that right? 
James Craigie: Yes, think of it as a—the honest truth is again 90% 95% of what’s in a cleaner bottle is pure water. And in a world where shipping costs and diesel costs have tripled in the past two years, you’ve seen what’s happened in liquid laundry detergent, we took a fair amount of the water out and very successfully. We looked at the cleaners’ category and said why can’t we do the same thing; in fact take it all the way. And the consumer will initially have to purchase an empty bottle with a refill tube attached to it and then after that all they have to purchase is the refill tube. And that refill tube will be 25% cheaper then buying the full bottle, the replacement bottle.  The product is green, it’s environmentally friendly, it works just as well as traditional cleaners. So as I said before think of it as a green product like Clorox Greenworks line but without the bottle, without the water and in that case about 40% cheaper then their product which is a little bit premium priced. So we think we have a great idea out there. Consumers I think will love it especially in a time when being environmentally friendly or green is a hot trend and being value oriented is a hot trend. And it’s under the Arm & Hammer line and the sub line of Essentials which has already been a very big hit out there. So we think we have an opportunity to really take advantage of some hot trends out there with a very great product. 
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: I’m worried that consumers are lazy and have you done testing with this to see what percentage of consumers are willing to do all that mixing? 
James Craigie: Yes, we’ve done a great deal of testing on this. It’s very easy. In fact the bottle screws into the top—the little test tube type thing screws right into the top of the bottle, you don’t even have to break the seal yourself, so there’s no mess, no fuss, as you screw it in it breaks the seal into the bottle that you’ve filled with water and then you just put the sprayer top on and shake it up and you’ve got a great product. So it’s very, very easy to use. 
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Who is the category leaders? 
James Craigie: You’ve got a bunch, cleaners is actually a very fragmented category--
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: You said you were 25% cheaper then the category leader--
James Craigie: You’re talking Windex, 409, of the world. There’s three items in our line right now. We’d be glad to share all those details with you but you’re talking the 409s, the Windex of the world. 
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Okay, I thought you meant 25% cheaper then the category leader in organic--
James Craigie: No we’re 25% cheaper then the mainstream category leaders and then Clorox Greenworks tends to be a little higher priced so we’re actually about 40% cheaper than them. 
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Could you comment on the specialty category that was sort of unusual in the first quarter?
Matt Farrell: Yes, it had again super charged growth rates driven by price just like in the first quarter. 
Alice Longley – Buckingham Research: Was volume up in specialty or was volume down? 
Matt Farrell: Volume was flattish in specialty. So their top line was driven by price so one way to think about our 8% growth rate is that 2% of that 8% growth was driven by [inaudible] for new products and new distribution on existing products. There’s another 1.5% in round numbers that’s attributed to special products so that would suggest then that the consumer business grew about 4.5% in the second quarter which is way over our 3% to 4% target. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: Can you just talk about your input costs and inflation assumptions for this year and next?
Matt Farrell: That’s a difficult question to answer because as you know how volatile all of our input costs have been. Virtually everything, all of our major inputs are up double-digit year-over-year. So we’re not in a position right now to call 2009. Some of the things that we have done that I think are as a result of the growing sophistication of this company is that we’ve done a lot more forward buying and hedges beyond diesel for the current year and into mid 2009 already. So we’re not in a position right now to call what do we think and specific—or what we think is going to happen to resin and diesel, etc. but we do expect that there’ll be significant inflation as well in 2009 versus 2008 so we’re preparing for that now. 
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: What happens if stuff starts to roll over, are there going to be hedging losses then?
Matt Farrell: One thing that could roll over is for example in the specialty business we’ve had a surcharge, this is on the top line so we had a surcharge for PSAD which is one of our very expensive inputs, so as if PSAD pricing were to come down, then we’ll have in the specialty products growth rate then comes down because that’ll be rolled out of the invoice price to SPD. 
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: And then just on the compaction stuff, when you lap it next year, what the non-recurring start-up costs were so say with the--
Matt Farrell: No, I wouldn’t be in a position to quote that. 
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: So about the liquid laundry price increase, what’s the delay there? It’s kind of like a free gift, so I don’t know why you wouldn’t take it. 
James Craigie: I didn’t’ way we wouldn’t but the details brand by brand, price point by price point, the competition is we still don’t know those details yet to look at it and study if we want to follow it, but yes, liquid laundry business is most impacted by rising commodity prices. We’ve been able to hold off stuff because of the benefits of compaction but we’re studying it very quickly and we should know very quickly. Liquid laundry compaction has been a big issue; all manufacturers have now converted 100% on that. In the wave one markets which were the southern half of the United States which was the first to convert last September, we feel very good. Our share is up almost 100 basis points in those markets so we feel very good. We’re doing well in that. T he category growth rate overall has also done very well, its high single-digits benefiting from compaction and then I would also tell you too its important to us liquid laundry detergent is our biggest business and we just competed an analysis with the help of Nielsen that shows that liquid laundry detergent has good the most least sensitive recession business out there so that was good news to us that the recession won’t impact liquid laundry detergent. So we’re feeling pretty good about that business and the competition is obviously taking a price increase and we’re studying it quickly so all good news. 
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: Is you’re business running a lot faster in alternative channels, have you pulled a scanner data business by business, it looks like sales are down a little bit in those channels? 
James Craigie: The mass market and club channels are definitely growing faster than the traditional food retailers at this point in time. And there’s definitely a channel shift going on and you’ll even see it within some of the mass channels between some of the players there. You read the papers, you know whose growing and who’s not doing well, but there’s definitely a shift headed toward the more value oriented channels which are the mass channel, the dollar channels and the club store channels. We do very well in all three of those. 
William Schmitz – Deutsche Bank: So this new Essentials cleaning product is it going to be corn based, ethanol and coconut oil like Greenworks or are you just going to do the same MES you’re using in the Essentials laundry detergent? 
James Craigie: I don’t want to get into all that, that’s kind of competitively sensitive but it’s a green product and meets all the criteria. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: The shift into mass, dollar and club, what does your profitability look like in those channels vis a vie grocery for example?
Matt Farrell: We don’t typically quote what our margins are by channel and I’m sure the customers would be interested in hearing that but we’re not--
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: I’m not asking for numbers, directionally are you more profitable in these channels? 
James Craigie: We don’t want to get into that, that’s very sensitive with customers, we treat all customers fairly. 
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: In terms of your marketing spend, obviously up big this quarter and you saw about a 4.5% volume growth it sounds like in your consumer businesses, are you happy with the effectiveness of that marketing, is there an opportunity to increase it beyond 13% of sales or is that where you see the returns start to kick in? 
James Craigie: We’re very happy; our marketing team has done a superb job. I think I’ve told you in the past we’ve been I think smartly shifting money onto our eight core brands away from some of our minor brands and then managing the minor brands differently to also do well there. The eight core brands are all growing. Most of them are having record shares and we do see the ability to continue to increase the marketing support. At some point it will cap out but we’ve told the world it’ll probably be up 50 basis points this year from 11.6% last year to around 12.1% this year and I still think there’s room to grow after that. 
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: You mentioned the SG&A spend you expect to be flat year-over-year as a percentage of sales, I think in the year ago third quarter you had a gain on a sale, so are you including that in your estimate?
Matt Farrell: Actually I didn’t say it was going to be flat year-over-year, we actually expect to get some leverage on the SG&A line as a percentage of sales year-over-year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere – Wachovia Capital Markets
Jason Gere – Wachovia Capital Markets: Just thinking about organic sales in the back half, obviously you’re expecting to exceed the three to four, first have was up seven and you’re probably getting some additional pricing, are you building in the price increases on liquid laundry and some of these other categories into your expectations for the back half and can you talk about price elasticity with volumes, do you think you can maintain that 3% that you did overall in the second quarter? 
Matt Farrell: The question with respect to growth is to follow the comment on specialty products as we start to lap the surcharge onto the specialty products business; the specialty products growth rate then comes back down to earth. That’s why all along its been important to focus on what is the core consumer business doing, the other two segments, so that’s domestic and international. So you would expect the Q4 growth rate then to be lower then Q3 certainly so we’d see a deceleration from Q2 to Q3, and Q3 to Q4.
Jason Gere – Wachovia Capital Markets: How about in the domestic business when you think about the good volumes you got and obviously there could be some more pricing how do you think about that with the model certainly we’ve seen and the HBC land, there’s been a bit more pricing a little less volume as expected so just wondering your thoughts on the back half of the year. 
James Craigie: The price increases will probably have no impact on the third quarter; they’ll probably have some impact in the fourth quarter. We are definitely worried about the price elasticity with consumers there’s just got to be a breaking point at some point with consumers so we’ll be watching that carefully but that’s where our new product innovation, our increased marketing spending, its helping it so far in the categories where there’s been pricing. We’re still growing and still growing to the high end if not above our target range. But we are worried. There is some point where consumers just don’t have a deep enough pocketbook to pay for everything going on out there. 
Jason Gere – Wachovia Capital Markets: Can you talk about what was the growth of Arm & Hammer in the quarter; I know last quarter was 10%?
Matt Farrell: We’ll get it for you. Arm & Hammer as you know has been growing at 1% and 4% and 6% over the last couple of years--
Jason Gere – Wachovia Capital Markets: I know you were talking that it would pull back from that 10, I was just wondering how that played out in the second quarter. 
Matt Farrell: It was 8%. 
Jason Gere – Wachovia Capital Markets: I’m sure you’re thrilled that all the Unilever questions are behind you just thinking forward how you anticipate any change in that mid tier category with [Hewish] now owning the liquid laundry brands? 
James Craigie: I can’t comment too much on the process, I’ll just say we’re fully aware of the sale process. That opportunity to buy that business didn’t meet our stated M&A criteria for acquisitions. It wasn’t a case of a number one or number two brands with strong growth potential, it wasn’t better then company gross margins, and basically that business has been a falling [inaudible] for the past 10 years so that’s why we kind of didn’t have interest. We feel great about our current laundry business. Its been doing very well especially with the value positioning. The whole compaction process has gone well for us and we told you just recently we built a new plant which we feel will continue to give us a strong competitive advantage in that business going forward. So we love that business right now and I don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t continue to be a big contributor to our future success. 
Jason Gere – Wachovia Capital Markets: In terms of the four main factors in driving gross margin, compaction must have moved up this month, I think it was number four last time, can you just give that pecking order, compaction came in a little bit more on the—the accretion from compaction came in a little bit more then you anticipated and obviously your gross margins were pretty strong. 
Matt Farrell : We got a lot of ties here tied for first. Pricing did not help us much in the first quarter but obviously helped us quite a bit in the second quarter. So I’d say liquid laundry has probably moved up to the number two position. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: On the testing you did for the Arm & Hammer Essentials where does it rank in the lineup of other new products recently, what is the repeat purchase indication you’ve gotten from consumer?
James Craigie: We just launched this brand in July. It’s just hitting shelves as we speak. The testing would show you this product is good or better than the mainstream cleaners out there and as good as the other green cleaners out there so we’re not going to go out and claim competitive superiority, we’re certainly going to claim its as good as other products but its green and its got a better value price and that’s the positioning we think will be a winner in the marketplace. 
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: Did you get repeat testing data that gives you a lot of confidence about it? 
James Craigie: Yes in the test we did yes. Obviously we haven’t seen that in the marketplace yet but the test results were very convincing of getting us to go ahead on this major new launch. 
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: Could you give us the composition of gross margin change, how much commodities affected the second quarter and how they were offset by pricing and the other cost savings? 
Matt Farrell: We typically don’t get into those kind of details but it’s fair to say that the cost increases in Q2 2008 versus Q2 2007 would have been several hundred basis point drag on gross margins which we had overcome with the four levers that we typically talk about. 
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: We’ve seen from some companies an impact on the order of 400 to 500 basis points, is that a range that might do us well? 
Matt Farrell: I don’t know if I’d go that high. 
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: Is the gross margin for the full year; does that first half rate, its looks like it’s about 40.5%, does that sound like a good rate for the full year? 
Matt Farrell: Well we typically don’t call line items on the P&L as you know, I did say that we expected Q3 gross margins to expand at a similar rate as to Q2 and then Q4 there are a couple of things helping the expansion there, one is Del gets better in Q4 because we roll off from the inventory step-up. The other thing too is that everybody should remember is that in the second half of 2007 our gross margins in the specialty business declined to its lowest point in Q4 2007. So we won’t have that drag either sequentially from Q3 to Q4 or year-over-year so that’ll help gross margin expansion in Q4 as well. 
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: It looks like the gross margin expansion has to be pretty significant in the fourth quarter to get to what the implied guidance is for the full year. 
Matt Farrell: Yes, it’ll be a bigger expansion then Q3. 
Connie Maneaty – BMO Capital Markets: It looks like it would be the biggest expansion of the year, is that right? 
Matt Farrell: Could be. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Nik Modi – UBS
Nik Modi – UBS: In terms of the—can you update us on the group you put in place to stem the share erosion on some of your declining brands, from the value deodorants and toothpaste brands? 
James Craigie: We call that our tiger team and they’ve done one heck of a job. They’ve slowed the decline in that category from double-digits into mid single-digits and also that business because the base business has been growing so much and that business is now only about 5% or 6% of our total company and again they’ve slowed down the decline rate and done a nice job on the gross margin side too there so the actually drag from that small piece of the business has been dramatically reduced which is a nice component to helping the organic growth. 
Nik Modi – UBS: On this new natural cleaner line, do you think category growth is enough to give you the kind of growth you need or are you looking for, are you relying more on share gains?
James Craigie: I think you’ll see some of both honestly. The cleaners category with the launch of Greenworks and other competitive products is all of a sudden heating up so everybody, the incumbents are defending and the new entries are bringing in the great new news, so I think you’ll see a lot of excitement in what was previously a pretty sleepy category in the past and we think we’ve got a very unique item coming in from using the refill basis and the great value positioning so I think you’ll see some stronger then normal category growth and we certainly hope to get some pretty significant share growth. 
Nik Modi – UBS: Just looking out the next couple of years, any plans or thoughts about taking the concentrate detergents to 3X from 2X like the Unilever business has? 
James Craigie: Definitely a good idea. 
Operator: This concludes the Q&A session; I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. James Craigie for closing remarks.
James Craigie: I want to thank you all for taking the time today to listen to our results and I think they speak for themselves and I think as I’ve told you I think we have a very sustainable growth model in this company right now and I think it will continue to deliver some exceptional results going forward. Thank you very much.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding and among other things the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie: Good morning, everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I will start out by giving you a brief summary of the first quarter results. I will then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with the financial details of the first quarter results. When Matt is finished, I will provide some information on the factors driving our key business units. And finally, I will provide earnings guidance before we open the call to field questions from you. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter business results. Reported net sales were up 7.5% versus year ago. Organic net sales, which exclude the positive impact of foreign exchange, were up 6% versus year ago. The strong organic net sales growth reflected solid gains in all three of our reported business units. These gains were driven by an improved pipeline of new products, increased marketing spending, excellent sales execution and cost-justified pricing actions on approximately 20% of the company's product portfolio. On top of our strong organic sales growth, we delivered solid gross margin expansion despite significantly higher commodity and energy costs. Our gross margin was up 160 basis points from year ago to 40.5% of net sales for the quarter. Approximately 100 basis points of the 150 basis point improvement was driven by favorable timing issues and as such some of these costs will shift to future quarters of 2008. Matt will provide further details on this issue. However, even if you exclude these timing issues, we still expanded gross margins by 60 basis points in the face of significantly higher margin costs. This reflects an extra ordinary focus on reducing cost that actually began back in 2006 when commodity costs started to skyrocket. This effort enabled Church & Dwight to maintain a flat gross margin in 2007 versus 2006, but we were not happy with that result since it fell short of our corporate objective to deliver our 100 basis point of gross margin improvement annually. As a result, we've stepped up our attack on cost savings starting in 2007 to make sure that we deliver the 100 basis point improvement in gross margin in 2008. Our Q1 results on gross margin are in line with our expectations to deliver that objective in total 2008. Finally, our earnings per share increased 23% over the year-ago quarter to $0.81 per share. These excellent results have given us a strong start to what we expect will be another year of record sales, profits and earnings per share in 2008. I will provide more detail on our business unit results and my outlook for the year in a few minutes. I'll now turn the call over to Matt who will provide you with greater details on the financial results for the first quarter.
Matthew T. Farrell: Okay. Thank you, Jim and good morning, everybody. As Jim just mentioned, first-quarter EPS was $0.81 per share compared with $0.66 in 2007. The strong sales performance and gross margin expansion were the drivers of our first quarter earnings results. The revenues were up 7.5% of which 1.5% was primarily currency. So 6% was organic growth. Of the 6% growth, approximately 3% was due to volume and another 3% is attributed to price and mix. Now let's briefly review the segments starting with Domestic. The Domestic business had a strong quarter. Revenues were up 3.5% and this was lead by cat litter, Arm & Hammer liquid laundry, First Response, Arm & Hammer powdered laundry, Xtra liquid laundry and Arm & Hammer Dental Care. We also successfully raised prices in February for condoms and baking soda. And new product launches also contributed to the revenue growth. International posted 5% organic growth, as this segment performed well in many countries. The specialty products business had an exceptional quarter as we can see in the release due to the strong demand coupled with a price increase for our dairy products and higher volumes in pricing in the specialty chemical side of the business. Specialty Products enjoyed higher year-over-year prices in Q1 for most its products. With respect to gross margin, our first quarter gross margin was 40.5%. That's a 160 basis points expansion versus last year. We'd like to remind everyone that we have four levers that contribute to our gross margin expansion and they are cost reduction programs, pricing, OGI manufacturing synergies and of course the benefits of concentrated liquid laundry. Our cost reduction programs have been in place for many years and are embedded in the Church & Dwight culture. Those cost reduction programs include things such as product reformulations, plant automation, more sophisticated forward buying and optimization of trade spending, just to name a few. These are the levers that serve to offset higher input costs for resin, corrugated paper, linerboard, diesel fuel and many others. A couple of items also affected the quarter, which we called out in the release. Our slotting costs were lower in Q1 year-over-year and we had the benefit of having hedged a portion of our diesel purchases for the year. Those two items together added approximately 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. We should all remember that the timing of slotting varies from year to year as it is depended up on new product launches and also new distribution for existing products. So both of these items will have a bearing on future quarters. Nevertheless, it is fair to say we are delighted with our gross margin performance in the quarter, which was up a solid 60 basis points if you exclude the timing of slotting and diesel hedge. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect healthy expansion of year-over-year gross margins in Q2 as well as each of the remaining quarters in 2008. Now marketing, marketing spend was 9.7% of revenues. This is a 80 basis point expansion over prior year spend rate of 8.9%. Marketing expense was about $7.5 million higher for the quarter than a year ago. This higher spending is a key driver of our organic revenue growth along with our innovative new products, which Jim will talk about in a few minutes. Our first quarter spend was about $54 million and we expect to significantly exceed that level of spend in the second quarter. In fact, we are targeting marketing spend in the second quarter to be approximately 13% of net sales. Now, SG&A, SG&A year-over-year was up $6 million due to $5.4 million of asset impairments, higher litigation costs, higher R&D and of course foreign currency changes. These increases were partially offset by a $3 million gain on the divestiture of a small specialty product subsidiary. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 14.1% in Q1 and this is consistent with the year ago. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect second quarter SG&A as a percentage of sales to be comparable to Q1 due to much higher R&D spending as we continued to invest in new products. Operating profit, the operating margin for the quarter expanded to 80 basis points to 16.8%, again driven by the higher gross margins. Moving down to P&L, other income and expense includes a $2 million currency gain and reflects lower interest expense as both interest rates and our debt levels are lower than a year ago. With respect to income tax, as you can see in the release, our effective rate for the quarter was 35.7%. Remember that we started the year with an expected range of 36.5% to 37%. So we now forecasting the lower end of that range, an affective rate of approximately 36.5% for the full year. EPS, EPS of $0.81 is a 23% increase over the prior year. About $0.05 to $0.06 of the year-over-year EPS improvement is due to the timing of slotting and the diesel hedge gain. So, all in all, a very good quarter. And our free cash flow, we generated $56.4 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and ended the quarter with $208 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our total debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA, per our bank agreement, was approximately $1.9 million at quarter end, which puts us actually below our stated range of two to three times EBITDA. So we are in a very comfortable position to complete the Orajel acquisition in July. Just a few comments on the balance sheet, accounts receivable are up $14 million versus a year ago and that's primarily due to higher sales in the quarter and the effects of currency. Inventories, you'll see are flat versus year ago and this is a result of our working capital management efforts. And in conclusion, short summary for the first quarter would be 6% organic sales growth, good gross margin expansion, continued reinvestment in marketing and strong free cash flow. A little bit of guidance now. With respect to guidance we have provided in our release an EPS estimate of approximately $0.61 for Q2 and this reflects strong organic growth, continued gross margin expansion, significant increase in marketing spending and higher year-over-year R&D spending, reflecting our investment in new products. This would make for a very balanced year in comparing the first half earnings and the second half earnings. So, we have about 51% in the first half, 49% in the second half, thus would be the split for 2008. We would end the second quarter with first half EPS up 14%, which is right on track for our full year goal of 13% earnings growth in 2008. Now back to you Jim.
James R. Craigie: Tanks, Matt. I'd now like to provide you with specific details on each of our three key business units; our Domestic business unit, our International business unit and our Specialty Products business unit to give you a better sense of what is driving the company's results. Let's first talk about Domestic business unit. Overall, we're very pleased with a 3% organic growth achieved by our Domestic business unit in Q1, driven by innovative new products, improved marketing programs, expanded distribution, improved merchandising and cost-justified pricing actions. On a product line basis, the organic net sales growth was driven by sales gains for Arm & Hammer liquid and powdered laundry detergent, Arm & Hammer cat litter, Arm & Hammer toothpastes, First Response test kits and Trojan condoms. In total the Arm & Hammer brand grew 10% in the first quarter versus the prior year, reflecting the continued strength of our mega brand marketing campaign initiated in 2006. On the new product front, we are continuing to see the benefit of a corporate new product team that was created in 2006 to deliver more innovative new consumer products with strong consumer appeal. Last year, this group launched over 50 new products, a record for our company. This year the new product team will launch slightly fewer new products in total but the revenue impact of these new products is expected to be greater than the new products launched in 2007. The new product launches impacting 2008 sales include the following. A new form of the essential sub line of our Arm & Hammer liquid laundry detergent business, which was first launched in 2006 and is formulated from environmentally sensible plant-based surfactin to deliver the same powerful cleaning capability as regular Arm & Hammer detergent. We've had excellent sales results to date on the essential sub line. We are now adding a new form of essentials called Free that is dye and perfume free and which appeals to the growing segment of consumers that are both environmentally sensible and have sensitive skin. We are also expanding the distribution of Arm & Hammer laundry detergent with OxiClean stain fighters in both powdered and liquid form. This new co-branded product delivers premium laundry detergent cleaning performance at a value price. It started shipping in the fourth quarter 2007. It is on track to be one of most successful new laundry products. As I mentioned earlier, these new Arm & Hammer products are being supported by more appealing and unified packaging, a trademark advertising campaign and increased levels of marketing spending as part of the new Arm & Hammer mega brand marketing campaign that we started in 2006. This marketing campaign has driven net sales growth for all Arm & Hammer brands from 1% in 2004 to over 6% in 2007 and again we did 10% growth in the first quarter of 2008. We've also launched innovative new products in our other core categories, including two new additions to the Trojan line called Thintensity and Magnum Thin, which capitalize on the growing thin segment of the condom category. A new Nair depilatory product called Shower Power, which enables women for the first time to use a depilatory product in the shower where the majority of women remove hair in their legs. This overcomes a key barrier to depilatory usage so that women can now enjoy the superior benefits of using a depilatory being smoother legs and a longer time between hair removals. Our new SpinBrush toothbrush called Swirl, which is a value-oriented product designed to encourage manual brush users to trade up into the battery-powered toothbrush category. Finally, the First Response brand has launched both the digital pregnancy kit and a daily ovulation test kit. At the same time, as we are driving growth of our largest brands in core categories, we've been successful in reducing the decline in our weaker categories, particularly antiperspirant and value toothpaste. Overall, we are very pleased with solid organic sales growth of our Domestic business unit. Our efforts to launch innovative new products supported by more impeccable marketing campaign and increased marketing spending is working. Finally, let me make a few comments on the industry wide initiative to reduce water content and liquid laundry detergent by moving to concentrated offerings. The rollout of concentrated line extensions began last September in the southern half of United States, expanded to the Central and Northwest U.S. in the first quarter of 2008 and the final wave for the Eastern U.S. will be completed by the end of this quarter. Church & Dwight has fully supported this initiative since the beginning and so far this rollout has gone very smoothly. The results are in line with our expectations in terms of reactions by our customers, our competitors and, most importantly, our consumers. All major retail customers have accepted distribution of the concentrated product. All competitors appear to have met the conversion timetable with the exception of private-label and a few accounts, but we understand those accounts will soon convert. And consumers have accepted the concentrated product, although some have a slight tendency to bypass our specific directions and overuse the product. If everything continues to go well this initiative will be a winner for our customers, our consumers, the environment and for manufacturers. Now let me talk for a minute about our two other business units, our International business unit and our Specialty Products division. Our International business unit, which represents over 17% of our total sales, also had a strong first quarter. Reported sales increased 15% over the prior year. When foreign exchange is excluded, this translates into 5% organic growth. This increase was driven by strong results in many of our foreign subsidiaries, particularly Australia and higher export sales. In our Specialty Products business unit, which represents about 11% of the total company's sales, net sales grew 22% over last year's first quarter on a reported and organic basis. This significant growth was largely driven by price improvement in animal nutrition and specialty chemicals as the business aggressively pursued recovery of their increased raw material costs. However, the growth of these categories also benefited from continued strong demand for these products. Finally, I'd like to make a couple of brief comments on our recent signing of an agreement to purchase the assets of Del Pharmaceuticals. This acquisition, which consists mainly of the Orajel brand, is expected to close in July 2008. We are looking forward to adding this number one brand into the Church & Dwight portfolio starting in the second half of 2008. We expect that this acquisition will be neutral to earnings in 2008 and solidly accretive in 2009 as we integrate these brands into the Church & Dwight infrastructure. Now let me switch gears now and talk about the future. While we are pleased with the first-quarter results, as I often state, we are never satisfied. First in terms of dealing with issues, we've been able to absorb an unprecedented level of cost increases for raw materials, packaging and transportation and still delivered solid gross margin improvement and earnings growth. We have a well-organized pipeline of cost-saving initiatives in the area of manufacturing, purchasing, distribution and trade savings that is being executed. We've announced price increases on about 25% of our company's product portfolio so far in 2008. These cost saving and pricing initiatives have been bolstered by manufacturing synergies from the Orange Glo integration, liquid laundry detergent compaction and volume scale leverage. The net effect of all these initiatives are expected to lead to a further steady improvement in our gross margin throughout 2008 to deliver our target of 100 basis point improvement versus 2007. This improvement in our gross margin should also enable us to increased marketing spending in 2008. We will focus this increased marketing spending behind our strong pipeline of new product innovations in every one of our core categories. Finally, we are keeping a very tight lid on overhead cost. One example of the tight management overhead cost is that in 2004 Church & Dwight delivered $1.6 billion in sales with 3800 total employees. Four years later, we expect to deliver over $2.3 billion sales, over 40% more sales with no increase in the number of total employees. Now let me translate all this in a specific guidance for the rest of this year. In view of our solid organic revenue growth, gross margin improvement and tight overhead expense control, we are confident that we can deliver our previously announced earnings per share forecast of $2.77 for 2008, a 13% improvement over 2007, despite a significant rise in commodity energy cost this year. In line with these annual earnings per share goals, we expect a 14% growth of earnings per share in the first half of 2008. I would challenge any of you to name one consumer products company who delivered our Q1 results and is promising what we are in 2008. We delivered strong organic growth and we're promising continued strong organic growth. We delivered strong gross margin expansions and we are promising a 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in the total year. We've maintained tight control overhead cost. We're investing in marketing to drive our future organic growth. We are making smart accretive acquisitions and all of this is adding up to 13% EPS growth despite significantly higher commodity cost. I'm not aware of one CPG company that doing that. With that that ends our presentation. I will now open the call to any questions you may have, which Matt and I will do our best to answer. Operator, please go ahead. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will be from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Hi guys, good morning.
James R. Craigie: Hi, Bill.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Can you sort of extrapolate on what solidly accretive 2009 names for Orajel? Is it like $0.05 or like $0.20?
Matthew T. Farrell: Hi, Bill, this is Matt. As you know, it hasn't been our past practice to be that granular and call out what the EPS is going to be, particularly when we haven't even closed on the deal yet and that's going to be till July. But we took everybody through what the numbers were. Remember $28 million of trailing EBITDA and $10 million of synergies and it won't be till the end of '09 that we can be confident that we will have everything integrated into the company. So you would assume then the run rate would be $38 million at some point and we said how we are going to finance. We have a financing underway now for $250 million worth of new debt plus $100 million of borrowings on existing either our revolver or our asset securitization and the rest in cash. So the simple way to think about it is, I think I may have said this previously, just assume 5% interest rate on the new money. And then you can figure out what the EPS accretion will be, but it's really too soon to tell when the integration will be complete.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay, that's fair. And then on the U.S business, can you tell us what the volume growth was in the quarter?
James R. Craigie: This is for just the U.S business?
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Yes.
James R. Craigie: Yes. I think we can help you with that. Hang on a second. The volume for the first quarter for domestic would be around 2%.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: That's great. And then I'd say one last one. Can you talk about some of the gross margin drivers, what's the impact of energy and raw material inflation was, some of offsets were?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yes --
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: [inaudible] excess slotting and the diesel hedge.
Matthew T. Farrell: Yes, well we typically do that on an annual basis, Bill. We try to break out what the impacts of our cost inputs and the impacts of our cost reduction programs. It's fair to say that our cost reduction programs, which are the biggest drivers for us and that's true every quarter, every year and that's part of the backbone of the company. So we are no different to anybody else. We have significant price increases up and down the line. Some single, some double digit increases for resin, diesel, linerboard, corrugated, the works and we are able to overcome those. So we probably have comparable increases to other companies but we wouldn't call it right now.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell: Hi, Bill.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Just wanted a clarification, on the slotting fees and diesel, do they represent an upside surprise to you in the quarter or they are just the difference between last year and this year in terms of earnings growth?
James R. Craigie: Yes, it is the year-over-year comparison, Bill. And we weren't surprised by the diesel because we we put the hedge in January, so we knew it was coming. So we hedged at a significantly lower than what the spot price is right now. So that was a wind flow for us in first quarter but obviously that doesn't help you in future quarters. And with respect to slotting, that's just timing. If you want to think about some of the things that impacts slotting; so it's going to be timing of your first ships to the accounts, the shelf resets will vary by account. Mix can affect as well, slotting costs are much higher for household versus personal care etcetera. So a lot of factors that will influence and it's going to hit but they do hit eventually.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And does the hedge carryover and give any benefit in the second quarter?
Matthew T. Farrell: No.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay.
Matthew T. Farrell: Well, not unless these will got to $5
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Let's hope not.
Matthew T. Farrell: And then it really rockets.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And I guess this is a nice way of asking, with you beating Street estimates by $0.08-$0.09, are we that bad at modeling or was this better than expected and your kind of forward guidance is just staying conservative with everything going on consumer spending?
Matthew T. Farrell: No, there's no way, there's now way with respect to the Street estimate, which we have a casual interest in. It was about maybe $0.06, as you said if we came at $0.81 and $0.06 worth is the timing slotting in the diesel hedge, then it's only... then it's a lot closer to what the Street estimate is.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: So $0.03, $0.04 better than expected?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yes. Yes, it is. We had a very good quarter.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: No. I agree.
Matthew T. Farrell: Yes.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And then I guess, Jim, can you may be talk a little bit about the quarterly trend, January, February, March, do you see any changes in ordering patterns and are you seeing any kind of trade down from the higher price products to may be some of the Arm & Hammer products?
James R. Craigie: Yes, Bill, the quarterly pattern wasn't that unusual. We had a couple of strong months, one little soft month. Q2 outlook is pretty much in plan with what we expect. We are noticing across some categories some category softness, which I just think reflects that we are in a recession. We are noticing a little bit of growth at private label in some categories. But I think we have always told you, we kind of feel our company is pretty recession resistant in some sense. We do up some premium brands, we worry about like OxiClean and SpinBrush, but we also have a fair number of value-oriented brands in our laundry business, our biggest business. We have value test kits are doing very well, we have value toothpaste doing well. So we are very conscious of the economy out there. We are very conscious of what's going on. We think consumer spending will take a hit. That's why we have been so aggressive as we have in managing overhead costs and cutting costs we can in the manufacturing side. We think we are pretty well set up to handle that. I mean of course I just saw Goldman Sachs' estimate today that oil can go to $150 to $200, we're not set up for that, I don't think anybody is. But I think we are pretty well positioned to handle what the current outlook in the environment given our product portfolio, and like I said Bill, we have been bunkered down for almost a year on cost as we somewhat thought the commodity cost will continue to spiral and it's paying off right now in terms of the ability to grow gross margin, while most of our competitors are not.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And just finally on that, did you see a net benefit from compaction in 1Q and will you in 2Q?
James R. Craigie: Yes. We did Bill but it wasn't the biggest driver. In fact, a lot of times when we put the release together we tried to give some order to the factors and if you will notice, we had concentration last as the driver of gross margin.
 Matthew T. Farrell : As we have told, because of the roll of timing, the benefit of compaction will grow quarter to quarter to quarter. By the third quarter of this year, the whole country will be in compaction. So, that will help us deliver, as we've said, continued gross margin improvement as we go across the year.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
James R. Craigie: Hi, Joe.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: It's actually nice to hear that you have a casual interest in our estimates. So, it's heartening. But anyway, in all seriousness the $0.05 or $0.06 boost in the first quarter, how much of that reverses in the second quarter and how much in the second half?
Matthew T. Farrell: It's not that academic, Joe, because again the slotting costs are going to be again a function of all the things that I described but some is going to hurt us in the second quarter but also second half, it's not all Q2.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Okay. So, roughly a third, a third, a third; is that fair to say?
Matthew T. Farrell: No, I didn't say that. I said it can be as much of all of it or half of it.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Okay. Fair enough. And then in terms of the inventories, the inventories were flat year-over-year and they were flat sequentially and I'd expected them to start to build ahead of the new product launches, given that slotting fees, it sounds like, will be bigger in 2Q given the timing of the launches. So I am curious why you mentioned that your working capital controls are doing very well. But I was just curious why the inventories didn't build this quarter a little bit.
Matthew T. Farrell: You probably have heard us say that we are cash flow junkies and we are getting a lot of traction with respect to our working capital management. I think, this is still yet to come out of the balance sheet, particularly in inventories.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then last on de-stocking, are you seeing any de-stocking activity in your major categories from retailers?
James R. Craigie: I would say we have seen a little bit, Joe. We've seen a little bit in some categories. That's very typical for the retailers if they expect less consumer demand, to be careful managing inventories. There has been a little bit, but not much and that's part of the reasons we are being so careful on our inventories too. But we manage... our consumption is very strong. So whatever extent they lower inventories, they are going to have to buy back. But, it has been very minor.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell: Hi, Connie.
James R. Craigie: Hi, Connie.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Let's see, you said you were going to be expanding Arm & Hammer with OxiClean stain removers. Does that mean you are already adding new SKUs since the thing just shipped in the fourth quarter or you getting new distributions?
James R. Craigie: No, it's no distribution, Connie. We launched it in both liquid and powder form and it's driving growth of both the liquid and powder detergent businesses. The later has happened in a long time. So, it's been helpful in that side of the business, too and it's just getting better and better distribution out there as we grow, we don't have the power to get full distribution in a short time period like some bigger companies are. So our distribution growth takes a little longer.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, so you're not at 100% ACB yet?
James R. Craigie: No.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: How far long are you?
James R. Craigie: Pretty well, pretty well. We've started advertising, so we're more than two thirds of the way.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Do you think Arm & Hammer, the 10% growth through the mega brand in the first quarter is pretty impressive, does that last for the whole year?
James R. Craigie: I don't think we will keep up with that level, Connie but we got it up into the 5% to 6% level last year and I think we feel pretty comfortable on that for the total year.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. And then finally, I don't recall that you used to give quarterly guidance. Have you changed in the way you you talk about the outlook?
Matthew T. Farrell: We did that once before Connie at the end of the first quarter last year. We thought we can give people some help, so we did the same this year. But we're not going to make a habit out of this.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Thanks very much. That's all I have.
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research. Please proceed.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Hi. I have gross margin questions. When you say your gross margins are going to be up a 100 basis points for the year, does that include the 160 basis points in the first quarter?
James R. Craigie: Yes.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay. And if we take out the special items, it was 60 basis points. From that point will we get increase in gross margin expansion through the rest of the year like 60 basis points to 70 basis points to 80 basis points?
James R. Craigie: Yes.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: All right. Are the $0.05 to $0.06 from the special items in the first quarter, how much... was half of it diesel costs hedging?
James R. Craigie: Well, $0.02 of it was diesel.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: That was $0.02, because that doesn't reverse, right?
James R. Craigie: No. That's a big windfall in Q1 and then you wind up having higher costs there after.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay. So that it basically does reverse?
James R. Craigie: Yes, if you think about it in your words may be.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: May be. And within Specialty how much of the 22% increase was pricing?
James R. Craigie: More than half.
Matthew T. Farrell: More than half of it.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay.
James R. Craigie: We had a price increases in virtually the entire portfolio in Specialty Products. Remember, we also had that surcharge that we put in place last year in August. So that's carried forward too. So out of that 25%, it's probably 20% is price.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay.
James R. Craigie: So, it's huge.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Now with that pricing, are gross margins up for that Specialty business or they still down?
James R. Craigie: They're not down. They are flat year-over-year.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: So that means the Consumer business gross margins were up even more without this?
James R. Craigie: Yes, that's correct.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: All right.
James R. Craigie: You are absolutely right.
Matthew T. Farrell: Because we have a growing SPD business with 22% margins. So consequently, the Consumer gross margins expand, if you want to do math, if you said if I took out the two timing items, slotting and diesel and said the company was up 60 basis points year-over-year. Then if you took the Specialty Products business out of the equation and said okay, what did the Consumer business worldwide expand and you would say it was 110 basis points. So it would be 110 basis points minus 50 basis points for SPD gets you the 60 basis points, which is a 60 basis points number we've talking about on the call. So it's an excellent quarter for Consumer.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay. Great.
Matthew T. Farrell: And so obviously that delta that helped us in Q1 would have some reversals in future quarters but you can see the Consumer business worldwide was over 100 basis points up.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay. And the final question, you made a little comment about how you see private label up in some categories, and you said, your premium brands might be a little vulnerable and your excited aboutOxiClean and SpinBrush. Where are you seeing private label gain share and are you seeing any slowing in OxiClean and SpinBrush?
James R. Craigie: We're seeing private label gain share in laundry, we've seen a little bit in cat litter, we've seen some in pregnancy kits. But in each one of those categories, our consumption is up very strongly. So far private label is not affecting us because of our new product innovations and our marketing spending. But it's a concern, we're watching it, it's typical in those kind of economy right now. But we feel just fine. We had record shares this quarter on cat litter, record shares on Trojan, record shares on our pregnancy kit business. So again, we're doing what we have to versus private label, which is launch innovative new products to be product differentiated and supporting them with strong market support and keeping our price gaps appropriately. Don't forget that laundry were value-oriented starts with. So that's a good place to start versus private label. And we also have value pregnancy kit in the brand called Answer, which is getting strong growth on top of the growth of First Response. So we're watching it carefully, but so far we are handling it we think very well.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: So just to get more on that, is First Response pregnancy test kit also gaining share?
James R. Craigie: Yes. It is now the market leader on a brand basis alone.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: And are you gaining share on laundry?
James R. Craigie: Yes.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay. And how are OxiClean and SpinBrush doing?
James R. Craigie: They're both doing fine. OxiClean had a very strong quarter, consumption growth. That's a category really it isn't private label you worry about, Alice, you more worry about people, it's an additive product, which people don't have to use quite honestly. They can just use their laundry detergent, they don't have to use the additive. So the concern there isn't private label at all. It's more that people will just forego using the product. And SpinBrush also had a sales growth in the quarter. But there again people could trade down to a manual toothbrush for less, but there again I mentioned to you, we are launching a new product, which will be the lowest price SpinBrush ever introduced in the marketplace. So, just like we have the Answer brand for pregnancy kit, we are going to have the lower price SpinBrush. So, we hope that not only we will keep driving our volumes if there is any kind of pricing concern, but actually we will get people who are buying manual toothbrushes to convert over to power toothbrushes and then from there trade up to even the better products in the category.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research Group: Okay, thanks a lot.
James R. Craigie: Okay.
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Jason Gere of Wachovia. Please proceed.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Great. Good morning.
Matthew T. Farrell: Hi, Jason.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Just, I guess, one question first just on the marketing spending. Can you talk about where that spending is going? Are you looking into more non-traditional means like online or are you sticking more with cable and print?
James R. Craigie: Jason, we are making a little bit of shift but for smart reasons. We are making some shifts from brand like Trojan to go more online just because it's a more appropriate form to reach the younger target audience. Other than that, no we are largely sticking to our traditional world. We spent about a quarter of our money in print and a fair amount of the rest in TV and radio and other vehicles. So, I would only tell you on the Trojan business, the only one you will probably see a more significant shift into online and probably start in the back half for this year.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Is there anything that you're seeing because I guess the scatter rates are... have been going up on advertising in terms of number of impressions, have you seen any change there?
James R. Craigie: I can't give you the details on that. I would just say that I expect the market to be very soft going forward and be a buyers opportunity and we feel fortunate to be in a position to invest in marketing. So we are to get even a bigger bank for our buck in the future quarters.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And then I guess the last question, just want to talk about the trade spending and obviously you guys have been focused on efficient trade spending. I'm just wondering what you're seeing out there in the channel. I mean, certainly you see a lot of deep discount promotions out there and I just was wondering what you're seeing from your competitors in the categories, especially when they are slowing at this point. And do you think this is a year that may be you shy away from net efficiency gains and you see more of the gains coming back may be in the next few years once we are out of the recession?
James R. Craigie: No, Jason, quite honestly, we are not seeing a more aggressive promotion activity to date in a category, particularly important in our largest category laundry. The whole move to compaction is kind of made that. There is a big change going on and we haven't seen promotion spending go up in that category, which is very pleasing to us. We are seeing prices stay at current levels and honestly with the price increase in some categories, we are still keeping normal levels in merchandising. And they are really, the retailers. We've not seen the pressure that you might expect in recessionary time. So we are continuing to try to carve out an efficient trade spending at this point in time going forward.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And then just a last question. If you can just give a little more color I guess on the two more challenged businesses, deodorant you and value toothpaste, how you're managing these brands in a softer economy? Thanks.
James R. Craigie: Yes, those businesses represent a little less than 10% of our total sales. We about a year ago put a very aggressive team in place to manage those businesses and changed the whole approach going to market with them. We went from national advertising basis to much more of a retail focus, working with the key retailers who control the majority of that business than working for lot of in-store promotions and in-store activity. And it's been very successful. Those bands were declining at a low double-digit rate and now we got that down into a mid single digit rate decline and then continue to work on that. So it's been a big improvement of reducing what you might call a drag on our company to actually have those brands declining at a much slower rate. We've actually had seen some positive progress with couple of businesses like Aim and Pepsodent, actually had positive sales growth in the first quarter because at the end of the program we're doing a retail. So the team has done a great job. We just took a total different approach to managing those businesses with the marketing spending they had and actually at the same time we shifted some of the advertising support over to our core businesses, our larger brands and it has driven even stronger growth on those brands. So the combination has been a big factor in the solid organic revenue growth we've had as a company and we continue to expect that going forward.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche bank. Please proceed.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Hi guys, a couple of things. Jim, just on the compaction stuff, have you seen some consumer pantry loading because some of the stuff we have seen is that people are kind of confused, and so they go about buying 100 ounce even though it's compacted?
James R. Craigie: Yes, it's a good question Bill, I mean we've read a little bit about it. We've actually read people doing that just in general because of recession running out there and buying products, I guess, probably more food oriented than maybe household and personal care. But honestly, we can't put a number on that. We haven't really seen anything measurable to date because honestly as I said, all the competitors are following the timetable. We haven't seen anybody try anything like loading excess inventories out there to drive more into the pantries. And consumers will pick up a larger bottle before they pick up the smaller bottles, but everything has been going smoothly with the trade on that. So I really don't think it had any kind of measurable impact on the business.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then, Matt, just on the hedge, if you're with the capital hedge, should it be at other income line, why is that flowing through an operating line or am I just totally off?
James R. Craigie: No. It goes through Cost of Goods Sold.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay. But I thought hedge's typically ran through the other cash flow, this was like an operating hedge, right?
Matthew T. Farrell: No, it relates to an item that's an input in Cost of Googs sold, so that's appropriate place to match it.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then on the other expense line, it also came down year-over-year, did you say why that was?
Matthew T. Farrell: Yes, we had FX gain in there of $2 million, plus interest isin there. So, interest expense is way down year-over-year, lower rates and lower debt.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our last question will be a follow-up from the line of the Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Hi, I was hoping you could share some observations of how the process for the sale of the Unilever detergent brand is going?
James R. Craigie: I know nothing about... honestly Connie we are in no position to comment on that. That's being run by another company, we are in no position to comment.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, just that I'd ask.
James R. Craigie: Okay. Anyway I want to thank you all for taking the time to tune in with us today. Again I would say we're very pleased with our first quarter results. We think we're very well positioned in this very tough economy right now going forward and as we said before we expect the year to have good solid organic growth. We expect to deliver the 100 basis points of gross margin improvement. We expect to keep tight control over overhead costs and on top of all that invest in marketing behind our brands to drive the organic growth. We are continuing to look for smart accretive acquisitions out there and we are committed to deliver the 13% EPS growth in the year despite the significant increase in commodity cost. And with that I'll say good-bye. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes our presentation and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight fourth quarter and full-year 2007 earnings conference call. Before we begin I have been asked to remind you that this is... that this presentation... that in this presentation the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon. Folks, my name is Jim Craigie, I’m the Chairman and CEO of Church & Dwight, and if I can get my Chief Financial Officer stop talking, I’ll start the presentation here. Seriously it’s a pleasure to be with you today in New York City. I knew our business results are great, but I really have to thank you for that ticker-tape parade. Seriously I have to view my company very much like the New York Giants, which I’m a huge fan of, which is why I have the jersey here. We are major underdogs to competitors like Proctor & Gamble and Colgate, but we have a great team, we have a winning strategy, and we have great momentum. And I feel confident about my company's future success as the New York Giants felt when they walked on the field Sunday night and we’ll talk about the today. First I want to tell you this presentation is… they all do contain forward-looking statements. They represent our plans and expectations, but the actual results are subject to risks outside of our control. So, listeners beware. We have a four-part presentation today. I’m going to kickoff for those of you who may not be familiar with the company, a little history of the Church & Dwight Company. And then I’m going to talk about our future vision, then I’ll turn over to Matt to take you through some details of our 2007 financial results and then I’ll get back up here and talk briefly about our 2008 earnings guidance. For those of you may not be aware of the Church & Dwight Company, it actually started over 160 years ago, Dr. Austin Church and John Dwight got together, their families each had a large baking soda business. Then they put their businesses together and had a monopoly on the baking soda business and they converted to the ARM & HAMMER name. And that was the beginning product of the company. Today that brand name has been diversified into many different product lines and the one fact I love to say is that no other brand covers more isles of the grocery stores than the ARM & HAMMER brand, you can see all the different categories that we’re in. On top of that we had a lot of acquisitions particularly since 2001, you can see we’ve added businesses in the laundry detergent business, in personal care with underarm deodorants and Nair… Nair is the depilatory, underarm deodorants like Arrid, Trojan condom business, the First Response pregnancy business, we picked up two face brands, that we bought the Crest SpinBrush business just two years ago, and most recently bought the Orange Glo Company, which had the OxiClean brand. Consumers love our product and this is a very fascinating slide we put together. You can see from this a lot of facts on there, but you can see we used to bake over 688 trillion choco-chip cookies, we are involved with 450 million loads of laundry every year, and we enable 520 million safe sex acts. And fairness is a very integral part of your life and it just tells how deeply immersed our product lines are in people's lives. My portfolio has also very rapid change as the result of the acquisitions. You can see here, in the year 2000, we were largely a household product company and then the acquisitions we’ve made from since have changed the whole profile of our company and today we have a very well-balanced portfolio between household and personal care, very much like Procter & Gamble. And that's a great advantage that makes us very ambivalent about future businesses that we acquire. We have plans in household, we have plans in personal care, and as long as the acquisition meets our targets we will buy in either side of the fleet. We’ve achieved very consistent and top-tier earnings per share growth over the past five years despite commodity cost pressures. Our EPS growth is driven by a combination of solid organic growth and acquisition synergies, and we expect to continue this trajectory in the future through solid organic growth and future acquisitions. You can see on this slide, that we have more than tripled our market cap since the year 2000. And we are TSR junkies. I know you have a lot of choices to make what the companies you invest for money in. We know you are almost required to look at the large-cap players like Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark. But if you look at our history, we’ve delivered a tremendous amount of total shareholder return to our shareholders. We’ve actually been a better investment over the last 10 years than every company on this list. $100 invested in Church & Dwight 10 years ago would be worth $510 today. In contrast, if you've got a median return of the companies on the list, that would be about 7.5% return, and that $100 today will be worth about $206, that's quite a difference. Let me talk about our future vision. To start with, the most important thing is a very strong portfolio of leading brands, you can see on this chart the brands that we want to be in number one or number two brands. If we're not number one or number two, we want to have a very defendable niche like we have in the laundry business with a very solid value positioning. Our vision is quite clear. We are focused on organically building those number one or two brands. We are explicitly focused on total shareholder return. And our goal is to deliver shareholder return at places in the top quartile of the S&P 500 over the long term. You can drive... or you can tie the main drivers of shareholder value being growth, margins, and free cash flow directly to our strategic priorities. In that context, we are going to continue to remain focused on improving the positioning of our brands in the marketplace, accelerating the rate of innovation of new products, entering new global markets and expanding our business in existing markets, driving costs out of our system both the supply chain and overhead costs, and pursuing TSR accretive acquisitions to build up on our strong foundation. And I want to spend a few minutes talking about each of these TSR drivers. Let's start first with improved brand positioning. We’d seek to drive strong organic growth through a combination of factors. We try to put our marketing... more impactful marketing every year. We seek bigger and better new products, improved sales execution. We focus our spending behind our key brands and we want to minimize the decline of our weaker brands. I will give you two case examples of those. First, our biggest brand, the ARM & HAMMER brand, which represents about 35% of our total portfolio. This is a brand consumers love. You can see from this ranking against others brands out there. It's one of the most beloved brands in America. And the good news is 75% of the US households purchase at least one form of ARM & HAMMER. However, the majority of households, almost 50% of that, only purchase one form. And we ask why, they honestly just aren't aware of the other forms of ARM & HAMMER. So, it's a great opportunity for us to get people to try other forms. A big part of the problem was, if you went back before 2005, the ARM & HAMMER brand was what you would call a dysfunctional family. They had different packaging graphics among the forms, there was minimum product news, they had different advertising messages for each of the forms, and it was minimal efforts at retail to join the products together. Well, since that we made a great effort to change this dysfunctional family into a highly performing family, you can see on the packaging side what we looked like before and what we look like today, the product line does look like a family. They are a very pretty family with very attractive packaging. We've also launched a SKU of new products out there. I'll talk about these over the course of my talk today. Two examples to start with, as we took our oldest product, ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda has been out there over 160 years. And two years ago we launched it in a form… it looks like the hockey puck that kind of attaches to the side of the refrigerator. By getting it up off the shelf and up in the air on the side shelf, it gives better odor elimination in the refrigerator and keeps your fruits smelling fresher and longer. We've also launched some other great new products. We started a sub line called Essentials. It’s a line of products made largely from natural ingredients that appeal to a rapidly growing segment and environmentally friendly consumers. This is available already in several forms of ARM & HAMMER, laundry detergents, the fabric softeners, and you'll see it in more forms in the near future. I also want to say, we're going to play the advertising, we could show you for a second one of commercials that have unified the brand. Please play the commercial. [Advertisement]. And this effort is working. This brand is growing at a rate of 1% in 2004, it is now growing at a rate of 7% this past year. So, we are very proud of that. Le me talk about our second biggest brand, Trojan. This is a great example of brand positioning with a number one brand that’s facing opportunities out there to double or triple the size of this business. Here is the problem, the United States has the worse statistics on sexually transmitted disease than any developed nation. You could see the facts up there. I mean there is literally 65 million people, almost one in five people in this country have an incurable sexually transmitted disease. The rates of people getting in are growing very rapidly, you can read the rest of the statistics there. It's a very shocking situation. And other than accidents [ph], the only way to stop a sexually transmitted disease is use a condom. Being simple, three-fourth of the time people aren't doing it. And the situation is when two people are having sex and they don't know each other’s sexual health situation and the only way again to stop disease is a condom, three out of four times people are not using a condom, three out of four times they are risking getting a sexual disease. We are attacking that problem. We are doing it in every form of media we can out there from traditional TV and print, to magazines to websites, online, in-school, in-store. We’ve also increased over the last several years our advertising spending by over 50% and we are trying some very provocative campaigns. I would like to show you this one that just broke last June. Please roll the commercial. [Advertisement]. We're trying to appeal to your psyche, we don't know what women call men who don't care about them, they call them pigs. We're trying to impress women who are 50% more likely to get an STD than a guy, to be careful about who you want to go home with. Do you want to go home with a guy who care's about you, who's going to protect you or you want to go home with a pig. Let us see, it’s in process and the early read on that is very promising and people are starting to become more aware of the risk that they are taking. We've also taken the brand into new adjoining categories, launching vibrating rings out there and we only sell those with a condom and we've also just recently launched in the finger vibrators and it's working. You can see here the history of the company since 1985. We had terrific results and even, we get to the point where our 50, 60, 70 share, you kind of believe you can't keep growing the share that we have, we've grown just in the past year our share by over two points. And I said earlier about focusing our marketing efforts and it is part of the brand repositioning and we've done that. We have focused our marketing spending behind our largest brands and after all a dollar is a dollar and a dollar spent in a larger and more powerful brand will generate more revenues and profits than in weaker brands. And you can see these are our key powerful brands, we've increased the spending behind them and we got terrific consumption results as a result of that in 2007. That doesn't mean we're getting up in our weaker brands, we do have some weaker brands in categories like antiperspirants and value toothpaste. They represent about 10% of our total business, but we changed the way we go to market on those brands. It's much more retail focused, it’s much more account by account and this effort led by a new team that we assigned these brands to has actually slowed the sales decline of these brands in half in 2007, so we're very happy with that result. Let me turn next to TSR drivers, which is accelerating new product development. New product developments had a very big impact on our success, we put a new product team focused just on new product development in 2006. Last year 2007 they launched a record number of new products, they just generate a very strong organic growth, you can see there a 5% and they’ve developed a very strong pipeline of products for future growth. Here is a few examples, in late 2007 we launched ARM & HAMMER Laundry Detergent with OxiClean that combines the great deodorization and cleaning power of ARM & HAMMER detergents, with the powerful stain fighting benefits of OxiClean and this terrific co-branded product delivers premium laundry detergent cleaning performance at a value price and we supported this new product launch with strong marketing programs and it’s off to a fantastic start. It's one of our most successful new product launches ever. In cat litter, in late 2007 we also launched a product called Odor Alert, which is the only cat litter that changes color when the cat soils it, so the consumer can see and remove the soiled product before they smell it. This is also off to a great start, led to some record double-digit share gains and volume gains in our cat litter business and we'll continue to grow the distribution in this business in 2008 for further growth. The products that are brand new coming to market, first one is new First Response Gold. This is a pregnancy kit that uses what we call gold technology, making it more sensitive than other kits and gives you accurate results within five days after you... before your miss period. This brand is on fire. We gained market leadership on this business in pregnancy kits last year and we exited the year with great momentum and this product will help us keep that momentum in 2008. Our Trojan business, as I told you the story before on that one, but we're capitalizing the momentum in that business. We're going after the thin segment, which is a growing segment of the condom category and it provides… which provides obviously greater sensitivity. And we're launching two new products this year, Trojan Thintensity and Magnum Thin. In oral care, we have two terrific products. First, a product we called ARM & HAMMER Age Defying toothpaste, which protects and rebuilds enamel. Secondly, kind of a unique concept in toothpaste, this is what we call a Whitening Booster and this a tube that looks like toothpaste, but you basically will apply this on top of your toothpaste. With your our toothpaste on your brush first and you apply this on top of it and it gives you two times the whitening power of the leading whitening strips. And if you've ever used whitening strips how messy and inconvenient they are. So, this is a very much more convenient and less-messy way of getting... of whitening your teeth. Also in the depilatory line, we have a new product called Shower Power. This is quite unique. Most women like to shave their legs in the shower using razors. You couldn't do that before with depilatories because they would wash off before they had their effect of removing the hair. Well, this product has been reformulated. It's now thick enough, a woman can put it on, get in the shower, take her shower, and two to three minutes later when she's finishing her shower, she can take a sponge and wipe it off and you get the benefits of depilatories versus razors. Razors kind of leave you with lots of nicks and cuts and scrapes. Depilatories leave your skin smoother and the time lasts longer between shaving because they cut the hair off lower on the sensitive skin. So, it's a great benefit that we hope will grow the whole depilatory category. Let me talk next about the next TSR driver, which is increasing global leverage. As you can see here, our international profile changed a great deal over the past seven years largely as a result of the acquisitions we've made. We went from 2% of our net revenue in the year 2000 to now 17% of our total business. And this is very, very important part of our growth. The international business represents, like I said, 17% of our net sales and now it represents 13% of our operating income and that's almost all personal care products, which have higher margins, so good potential. We’ve got very steady growth in our key subsidiaries. As you can see there Canada, Mexico, UK, France, and Australia. We are also entering some new large markets out there. We have a fast-growing business in Brazil, a depilatory business, which we bought a business down there to help that. And in China, we have OxiClean and SpinBrush and we’ve recently launched Trojan via some distributors in China. So that's off to a good start and we're also... we export our products to 70 other countries. Next, let me talk about the TSR driver of achieving lower cost. We've consistently grown our earnings over the past three years despite commodity pressures and the key driver of that EPS growth was gross margin. We have a very laser focus on organic cost savings and acquisition synergies. You can see from this chart, we expanded gross margins by 900 basis points since 2003, and even in years like 2005 and 2007, which were shocked with significant cost increases, we were able to hold gross margin in those years as a result of our cost-cutting machine. And we expect to continue to increase gross margin by 100 basis points a year starting again in 2008 despite significant cost increases. And that will be driven by a finely tuned company-wide productivity program, acquisitions synergies, laundry compaction, and pricing. And Matt will talk more about that in a few minutes. As a company, we set a goal for the future. Our goal is to get to a 50% gross margin. We're going to do that at a rate of 100 basis points to 125 basis points a year. And we see half of that coming from organic cost savings and half of that coming from acquisitions. And there's a lot of sources of those organic savings. We have a very effective cost-saving program that has been in place for years. We'll be selectively pricing brands to offset commodity costs. We've reduced our trade spending, reduced our SKUs, in this past year alone we've cut our SKUs by 39%, enabled us to close a warehouse and save a lot of money. And we also see us investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities to help reduce our costs. Last but not least, the TSR drivers creating value through mergers and acquisitions... sorry about the button here, must have been a patriot button here... quite operative, right. We're very disciplined about the acquisitions that we make. We will make only TSR accretive acquisitions. We will buy the brands at reasonable prices so we can capture value and we will drive significant cost synergies out of the businesses we buy by integrating into our company's strong foundation. I will just give you a fact on that a little factoid as I call it. Four years ago when I entered the company, the sales in this company were $1.5 billion and we had slightly over 4,000 employees. Four years later, our sales are $2.2 billion, 50% larger and there are 3.800 employees in our company. So, we have done 50% more sales with less employees, and that's what we seek to do. We're very focused on finding brands that are bolt-on number one and number two brands or defendable niches. They have higher growth, higher margin brands, and they have sources of sustainable competitive advantage. And our last two acquisitions were in the size of about $300 million. That’s about the size we seek to make. Our competitors can have $1 billion brands. We will be very happy to have number one or number brand in the $300 million to $400 million category and grow it very successfully as we have with businesses like OxiClean. Let me give you an example of that. This is the... what's called the Orange Glo Company, its key brand was OxiClean and that was owned by the Apple Family, kind of the fruitcake situation there. But we bought this company in late 2006. It had several appealing products, the largest of which was OxiClean. And this is a great example of what we do as a company. Now here is a… OxiClean was a premium-priced household brand. It was in a growth category. The additive... laundry additive category is $1 billion category. This was the number one brand. It's got what you love about household products is the high purchase frequency and it bolted on beautifully to our businesses. We already made liquid and powder detergents and this product was being sourced out of co-packers at high margins. So, we bought a number one brand, we bolted it onto our laundry business and took a lot of costs out in the process. We also had more muscle at retail than they did, so we closed a lot of distribution boys, we increased yields for our merchandising support, we increased the advertising support, we launched some innovative new products like the little [inaudible] that kind of leveraged with the success tied go... [inaudible] and we drove a lot of synergies out of the cost supply chain, and the results have been terrific. We have gained over 9 share points from this business in just 18 months and already was the number one brand in this category. We’ve delivered over $20 million in synergies and we usually took this brand, as I mentioned before, we co-branded it with ARM & HAMMER to create a terrific new laundry detergent that offers premium laundry performance at a value price still. Now, before I turn the podium over to Matt for a few minutes to talk about our results, let me talk about our experience and motivated management team. Our company loves to attract people and I am example of that, but my whole staff is too. We've been trained at the Giants, we've been trained at the Procter & Gambles, the Crest, Reckitt Benckiser, Johnson & Johnson, and then we’ve also gone on to the private equity world and we have learned how to work and turn around situations with nickels and dimes versus the $100 bills you have in the big companies. And we love this environment. It's a small environment. You can really control the company in what you do and you have a big impact on the company from your performance. You are not just one of the 1,000 people like you. We are also pretty stingy, I hate to say, we don't have company cars, we don't company planes, we don't have club memberships, but that's just fine. We are also committed to creating shareholder value, our net worth only increases with your net worth, because our bonuses are tied to the packers that drive the business, and our equity is 100% stock option. So that stock doesn't go up is what you want, we don't get rich, you don't get rich, so we are in the same boat. And we also have significance in the game. Let me turn it over for a few minutes to Matt who is going to take you through the 2007 financial results and I'll come back up and talk about the earnings guidance. Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Hello, everybody. I am going to do four things. I am going to spend a few minutes on our business model, and I am going to review Q4 and the full year and spend a little bit of time on the balance sheet, and I'm going to conclude with our priorities for 2008, and then I am going to turn it back over to Jim, he will talk about the guidance a little bit. We have a pretty simple formula, though if you're new to Church & Dwight what you are going to hear us talk about constantly is following. It's pretty simple, we focus on three things, top line growth 3% to 4% annual growth. So this is an evergreen target within the company. Second thing is margins. It's common out within the company, what we try to do every year is expand our gross margins 100 basis points and 125 basis points and increase our operating margins 70 basis points. And the third thing is free cash flow and two things about this company is, it's like a lot of CPG companies, it's not capital intensive. So, we’re pretty vigilant about how much we spend in the plants, as well as our working capital management. I'm going to take you through some of those stats later. Free cash flow conversion is important to us as well. So quality of earnings matters. Okay, next slide is important, too. You can tell a lot about a company by what gets talked about internally. So, we’ve used this slide before, and we use this internally as well as the last slide quite frequently with employees. And if you look at the right-hand side of this slide, these tactical programs. So, what do we mean by all these various programs? So, let's start with the top on the P&L, so sales. New product development, we have a new product development team. You've heard Jim talk about that was formed in early 2006. So, it’s really bore fruit in 2007 with 51 new products that we launched. In 2008, we are going to have 35 new products coming out, fewer but bigger. If you go down the page now, trade spending, what's meant by that. We spend several hundred million dollars a year with the trade. So, this is an amount that’s netted in our net sales amount. So, we're constantly asking ourselves, okay, what kind of lift are we getting from the money that we are spending in trade? Continuing down cost reduction, SG&A. We try to grow the SG&A line... we actually don't try to grow it, but if it's going to grow, we try to grow it at a slower rate than our top line, so say 2%. As far as procurement goes, we are a much bigger company than we were a number of years ago as a result of acquisitions as Jim said. 2003, this was a $1 billion company; today it’s a $2.2 billion company. So, we're trying to take more advantage of the kind of leverage that we should have as a result of that size. Marketing spend. We spend over $2 million a year in marketing. So, we're constantly asking ourselves, hey, are we getting the return on what we're spending in television and print? The same is true for R&D, we spent $50 million in R&D in 2007. The same question, that's 2.3% of sales. Are we getting the return on that? And then M&A, we acquired Orange Glo in August of 2006. So, the constant drumbeat is, hey, are we getting the synergies that we expected? We expected $20 million of synergies, $10 million from SG&A and $10 million from cost of goods sold. Now cost goods sold benefit, we got a little bit of it in the fourth quarter, we’re going to get three quarters of it next year, but I would say more about that in a moment. And then finally, cash, I'm going to cover this a little bit later on, but you see the trends in this company is pretty consistent with respect to how much we spend on CapEx as a percentage of sales. And there's also how much working capital as a percentage of sales that we allow. Okay, 2007, terrific year with 19% EPS growth, we had a 5% organic growth, that is a little bit supercharged by the results in our specialty products business, and we got our targeted 70 basis points of operating margin expansion and we did get did get ODI integrated into the company. So we now not only are obviously shipping and building, we have all the co-packers that we've taken out of the game and we are now producing in-house as of the fourth quarter. Then final free cash, we’d a record $200 million of free cash flow in 2007. Now, I am going to roll through the fourth quarter, the headlines. So EPS $0.46, $0.36 last year, 9% organic growth, operating margin is 160 basis points, and free cash flow of $77 million. So now, if you look at some of the pieces, we’ll start with the domestic business, so domestic business had terrific topline growth. Lots of contributors there, cat litter, as Jim talked about earlier, a great quarter; Trojan, SpinBrush a terrific quarter as well, lots of displays out there, pregnancy kits, and also ARM & HAMMER toothpaste. So all that combined to have a 70 basis points expansion in gross margins. And something to keep in mind there is that we have all the commodity headwinds that all the other CPG companies are dealing with. So we had to overcome that as well as the transitional costs that we experience as a result of liquid laundry concentration. So it was a terrific quarter for the domestic business. Moving to international, we’d a nice quarter as well. We dad 3% organic growth in the quarter. And then finally, the specialty products business, you see that number, you see 31% revenue growth, so that is obviously a pretty supercharged number. So what is driving that? What's driving that is primarily our animal nutrition business. You heard Jim mention that the animal nutrition business primarily serves the dairy market. So what is going on in dairy? What is going on in dairy is just tremendous demand for milk worldwide, particularly in developing countries. So that combined with a weak dollar has made exports just explode. And if you are a student of this market, you probably also know that inventories have been declining over the past three years, this is powdered milk inventories. So what that means is that historical production actually wasn't matching demand. So this bodes well for this business going forward. On the downside, one of the key ingredients in this business is something called palm fatty acid distillate. The things that you really need to know is that simply that that has been driven up because of demand for biofuels. So a terrific quarter from the topline, both volume and price, but certainly on the cost of goods sold, we only got hammered from the increases in palm fatty acid distillate. So what they did was drove the gross margins down. So we have a mix issue in the fourth quarter. So this is the business that drove us… the margin percentage down year-over-year. Okay, here are the numbers for the fourth quarter. So you see going down the page we had 9% organic growth. Gross margin, I just talked about, that was largely driven by the results in the specialty products business. Marketing, a lot of spending behind the brands, 13% of sales, and SG&A we got a nice leverage leap year-over-year, so that all combines to expand our gross margins by 160 basis points. And you also see that we overcame very different effective tax rate in 2007 versus 2006. You may recall in 2006 Congress passed the R&D tax credit very late in the year, so we got the full-year benefit last year in the fourth quarter, so all in all, a very nice quarter for the company. Now, here is the full-year, up 19% to 246, 207 last year, 5% organic growth, again we had the 70 basis points margin expansion and $200 million of free cash flow. And again, similar slide as before, we're going through each of the businesses, first domestic. So, domestic growth driven by OGI of course, so we had full-year of OGI in our numbers for 2007, but also Super Scoop, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry, Trojan, SpinBrush, all had terrific years, and we were able to hold gross margins in spite of the commodity headwinds and the transition cost of concentration. International also delivered organic growth, so their organic growth was over 3%, and also had gross margin expansion. And finally, specialty products, nice year with respect to volumes, but also the issue of palm fatty acid derivatives drove their margins down year-over-year. Here are the numbers, so 5% organic growth, gross margin flat year-over-year. The marketing is an interesting trend, if you went back to 2005 we spent 10.6% of sales on marketing, so you see a 50 basis points increase '05 to '06, another 50 basis from '06 to '07, and we should see a similar trend in 2008. SG&A, a very nice trend there, down year-over-year 120 basis points, and then operating margins of 70 basis points expansion, and finally EPS up 19%. Little more detail on product lines here, so you can see the break-up between household products and personal care. So that 20%, that's driven largely by the OxiClean business somewhere… Orange Glo. Remember, we had 12 months of that in 2007. But also ARM & HAMMER liquid and odor were driving that. Personal Care, driven by Trojan's SpinBrush and Nair, but I think that one thing to keep in mind here is that, that is net of the value toothpaste businesses and aerosol antiperspirant business, which had been problems for us and have been declining year-over-year. So that is a really nice result for personal care on a full-year basis. Now, here are the quarters, just another very interesting and telling slide. So you see in Q1 when we started the year, we were down 1% and that is because we had a very difficult comp year-over-year, but then you can see how the organic growth really accelerated in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So strong last three quarters of the year. We ended above our 3% to 4% target. Innovation is a big driver of this, but also I think a lot of good things happened in packaging, our marketing is working giving some additional distribution as well. And the results of our specialty products business, they're up tremendously year-over-year. That drove us to the way over our range of 3% to 4%, up to 5%. We ended the year with a lot of momentum, so you run your eyes down the page and you see these are very important products to us and we had record market shares. So this is a very good sign for Church & Dwight as we enter 2008. Now here's the balance sheet, just a kind of a brief look here. The numbers are a little bit smaller, but if I call your eyes to the middle of the page, you see net debt right now is $606 million. That is the lowest it’s been since September of 2001. It's very, very low right now for the company. Second thing is working capital, so that number in the first line of 295. The way we calculate that is we have simply inventory accounts receivable and accounts payable tracking around 13% of sales and similar to where we were in 2006, so very consistent. Capital investment, so you can see historically we will spend about 2.2% to 2.4% of sales on CapEx. So, we spent around $49 million in 2007, expectation would be around $55 million in 2008, so enough said there. Okay, one of my favorite slides is free cash flow conversion. A very good measure of earnings quality is cash flow conversion, so we generated $200 million of free cash flow. Our definition of free cash flow, by the way, is cash from operations minus CapEx, so that's before dividends, so 118% conversion rate. What's notable here is that we've had 100% or better now three years in a row. I mean free cash flow conversion is just a very important contributor to shareholder value. EBITDA, just one more illustration of EBITDA, this is defined by our bank agreement. You can see that [inaudible] by 21% over this period of time. So now our financial capacity, very strong balance sheet right now. You can see we're sitting on a lot of cash, $250 million, net debt as I said before, around $600 million, and we're in a very good position to be acquisitive. With a debt-to-EBITDA of 2.3, our stated target is 2 to 3 times, and that's total debt-to-EBITDA. If you look at it from a net debt standpoint, we're well under 2 right now. And now, the uses of free cash flow. What this slide is intended to do is to give everybody a handle on how we intend to deploy free cash flow. It's an important decision and one that's of great interest to shareholders. We regularly evaluate what is the best way to use our cash, and they are prioritized for you on this slide. If you saw this slide last year, you see debt reduction was at the top of the page, and that is because we had a goal to drive our debt-to-EBITDA down to the low end of the range, which we have done right now. So our M&A has moved up on our list as a result of the debt ratios being now in a comfortable range. I would say just moving down the page, we are going to be responsibly investing in new product development as well as maintain our current CapEx levels to protect our brands. Debt reduction, if you’ve listened to our earlier calls in the year, you’d know that we'd started to stockpile cash starting in June 2007 when the credit markets went off a cliff. So we’ll probably continue to do so in the foreseeable future. The reason we did that is because our credit facility is largely term debt. So if you pay down term debt, you don't get to borrow it back. We don't have a big revolver in our credit facility. And finally, return of cash to shareholders, that's last in the list right now, but that's something that we evaluate periodically as a management as well as the Board of the company's focus right now, is growth. So consequently, there is now intention of share buybacks at the moment. And last, I get this question quite frequently, but we haven't bought back shares since 2001. And now, priorities for 2008, there should be no surprises on this page, obviously a 3% to 4% topline growth. I mentioned earlier that we have 35 new product launches planned in 2008. Most of those will go out during the first six months of the year. Second on the list is 100 basis points of gross margin improvement. These will fall differently and I'm going to show you that on the next slide. So we have OGI manufacturing synergies. So as of October, we started manufacturing all the Orange Glo, or OxiClean products in our plants. So we had one quarter of benefit in Q4, we're going to get three quarters next year. Second on the list, price increases. You probably saw in the release we have price increases planned for Trojan, baking soda as well as cat litter. It’s also true we’re going to have price increases in international and also in our specially products business. And an obvious question might be, what might be the average price increase for this 20% of the company, and that would be around 5%. The thing to keep in mind though is that typically when your price increases, you also have some hits on volume. So we clearly do not expect all that to fall down through gross profit line, but we would expect a good piece of it fall. And then benefits of concentrated liquid laundry, you probably know that the first wave is complete. The second wave started on Jan 21. The third wave starts on April 21. So as we exit 2008, we're going to start getting the full benefit of liquid laundry compaction. But in the meantime, there are transition costs not only that we experienced in Q4, but we will have a bumpy ride initially on the way but there... the benefits of liquid laundry, it’s going to be a net positive for us in 2008 and it's going to help us expand our margins. Cost reduction programs, those are things that we do all the time, they are ongoing. And the last analysis is free cash flow conversion. When we're meeting in next year we would like to have… continue our steak of 100% free cash flow conversion. We do sometimes… some opportunities reduce our international inventories and hence SKU reduction is something that we are very vigilant about as well. This is just to burn it in, the comment I just made a moment ago, how to think about the catalysts for gross margin in 2008. Now I think about this… there are four leverage that we have. Two of them are ongoing. What most companies are going to avail themselves of, that is cost reduction and pricing. There are two others that are specific to Church & Dwight. Those will be the OGI synergies and laundry compaction. Now, the timing of those are going to be a little bit different, cost reduction programs obviously hit throughout the year, the pricing… and domestic being our biggest business, is going to start on February and beyond. So we get more of the benefits after Q1. The OGI synergies are really going to be Q1, Q2, Q3 because Q4 we are going to the lap it year-over-year. And laundry compaction is just ongoing throughout the year. So we would expect gross margin expansion in each quarter, the lightest quarter being Q1. We would expect it to build as we move through the year. That concludes my remarks. I am going to bring Jim back up here in order to wrap it up.
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Matt. Can I have the [inaudible] back? Thank you. Good handoff. This is generally the shareholder return model we have used historically, and Matt kind of took you through the pieces. I would just tell you, we are very confident to achieve all these metrics including the gross margin expansion despite the significant commodity headwinds out there. As Matt said, we will be raising price at this point on about 20% of our business and everyday we pickup news from some of our competitors, so we might even placed beyond that in 2008 we pick up news. And we’re going to be increasing our marketing spending as Matt said in order to deliver that operating margin improvement by at least 70 basis points. This is the official release you saw out there. And basically it says, at point in time, given what's going on in the new environment, we feel comfortable at raising our earnings per share target by 13% over 2007 to a target of $2.77. That will be driven by very solid organic growth. Gross margin expansion of at least 100 basis points, and that will be driven, as Mat said, through the combination of pricing, the OGI synergies, laundry compaction, and ongoing cost savings across the company. And we will also be increasing our market spending. So let me open the floor now to questions. And also I would ask you, when you ask a question, please state your name, your company, so the people listening in the conference can answer. Question and Answer
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Alice?
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Alice Longley, Buckingham. My question is about Unilever Detergents. I think everybody knows that they are up for sale I guess, and could you outline why Unilever Detergents might be a good acquisition for you, why it might not be a good acquisition for you, and in particular talk about the market share losses in Unilever Detergents, why would you possibly want that business given that they keep losing market share, aside from the cost synergies?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. I would love to talk about acquisitions, but I legally can't.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Just speculatives.
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Just speculatives, right. Well, the patriots were a 12-point speculative answer and that didn't work out either. I would say… as I said before, we are very ambivalent about between buying household and personal care. Our last acquisition was a household business… actually a laundry business. So we look at everything in those categories. It’d awful nice to pick up a nice chunk of a laundry business. The OGI acquisition was tremendously beneficial to our company. So I would just say, like other players we are looking at it, and there are pluses and minuses in a deal that honestly I can't go into, even for competitive reasons I don't want to go into it. But it's a big thing out there right now. We are definitely looking at it, I’ll tell you that, I shouldn't even tell you that, but I can't tell you anymore than that.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Can you compare it to the acquisition of the Unilever Toothpaste, which continued to lose share after you bought them? Do you think that this situation is different and you could possibly stop market share loses in those detergents?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That I shouldn't say anything. I would just say to you that I would… those are night and day, those toothpaste... honestly, the one deal we wished we never made. Those brands were in much worse shape. They were really old, clouding brands, these are not. There are some very good brands in that portfolio of Unilever Laundry and in much better shape. So they the have been declining, but nothing near what the Unilever Toothpaste brands were.
Unidentified Analyst - JP Morgan Securities: [inaudible] from JP Morgan. Aside from laundry, are there any specific parts of your portfolio that you think you need to fill holes with acquisitions or any ancillary businesses that you would be attractive to combine with what you've got?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's a good question. I don't think we have any holes quite honestly. I think there is always ways to strengthen. Again laundry was our biggest business and we strengthened it by picking up OTI with the OxiClean brand knowing that we pick up a brand that we grew, but like I said we co-branded that with ARM & HAMMER to even help our ARM & HAMMER brands. So that was a home run. We just love acquisitions like that where we picked up a number one brand and I think we even shocked ourselves a little bit, we've grown the share from like a 25 to a 34 in just 18 months. We've grown the margins. We've cut costs. It’s just been a beautiful acquisition. So I guess we were ambivalent. I have 17 plants worldwide that make household products and personal care products. I can fill bottles with liquid, I can fill boxes with powder, I can fill tubes, I can fill creams and lotions and things like that. So honestly, it puts us in a great position to look at businesses. Now, I would tell you, we are very picky. We are sticking to our guns. We want number one or number two brands available out there. Oral brand has a very unique positioning. It may not be number one or two. We want ones that we can bring in-house and knock a lot of cost savings out either through the supply chain or through SG&A, and generally… we’d love them to be bolt-ons to our existing categories, but we will look at new categories too. If we hadn’t done that we never would have bought the Carter-Wallace business back in 2000, which bought us the condom business we weren't in, bought us [inaudible] we weren't in, brought us depilatories we weren't in, and brought us pregnancy kits, and the bulk of that franchise has grown dramatically over time. So, it expanded our business. So again we prefer bolt-ons to existing businesses, which we have a lot. One of the issues our company talks about a lot is complexity. We are very complex for a little company, but the advantage of that is we can pick up acquisitions in those categories because we're in a lot of businesses and have a lot of different manufacturing techniques. We've people who understand a lot of those businesses. So we're very, I would say, agnostic when we go look at acquisitions, but we are very quick to... within only our criteria... I’d probably reject an opportunity because the moment we see them we look at versus our criteria, if it doesn’t meet it we stop looking. And even though I don’t care how attractive it is, but what the investment bankers tell us it is. I'll tell… I’ll make a comment. I am very stunned at some of the acquisitions recently by some of our competitors. I won't name names, but I am stunned in what should be a buyer's market honestly right now since the private equity world has plenty of money, but the banks won't loan them any money. So they are pretty much out of play. It should be a time where opportunities to acquire companies goes at fair values, but not ridiculous values and I think they are being paid some very ridiculous prices recently for some good properties, but at a very high multiple. So I will not pay those kind of multiples. So honestly, if the world stays that way, we'll be fine in driving the results we showed you organically. If the sellers believe in fair prices we'll be doing some acquisitions. If they believe they can get the prices that some companies recently sold, then they're going to have a nice day because they're not going to be talking in an efficient way.
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan Securities: And then are there any categories you'll avoid?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'll avoid, there probably are. Honestly, the personal category is a crazy category, there's 23 brands in that category which are about 15 too many. We're one of the 15 too many. If a very tough category dominated by four or five players who spend a modest amount of money and the other 15 spend a 20% of that, you just can't compete unless you buy one of the big five. So I probably would not enter that category because [inaudible] the big five because the category dynamics are such that you just can't win where it's so different between the big players and the small players and just too many players. So I don't think you'll see as buying any personal brands. Thus if we look at the categories, we have to believe we can successfully compete in the category and do it. I would say, do we prefer smaller categories, I love being the number one brand in a $500 million less category because, guess what, there's a guy in Cincinnati who wants $1 billion brands. Well, you can't have a $1 billion brand in a $500 million category, that math doesn't compute. So they can have all the $1 billion brand if they want. I will take the $300 million number one brand in a $500 million category that has growth potential and that's where we are very successful. The Trojan businesses, the pregnancy kit businesses, laundry additive businesses, things like that, that's where we find our success is greatest, so that's where we care to play. Mr. Schmitz? That's all right. The [inaudible] with the microphone wins the game okay.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets: Sorry about that, Bill. Hey, it's Jason Gere with Wachovia Capital Markets. Just a question about the pricing that you're taking, can you talk, one, about the competitor response, and two, I think you've said that most of that it will fall through. So can you talk maybe a little bit about the balance of trade spending and advertising? I know trade spending is an area that you want to cut back rather than increase, but especially in terms of the fears of the U.S. recession, can you talk maybe a little about the balance between the two this year?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, very good question. On pricing, we generally lead in categories we're number one and we follow where we’re not number one. So that's just the simple rule of thumb. The price increases we're taking are just helping us to offset most of our cost increases, which have been again dramatic, which has gone out there, and corrugates and resin and diesel are just... we thought we had one shockwave in late 2005 and it's another shockwave coming through. So that's... it's largely how we look at it. We don't... we're not trying to do anything, but kind of recover our cost structure there. As far as trade spending, we're very vigilant about that. We've had a Seibel system in place, a very radical computer system that analyzes every trade deal we do. We've been trying to cut back on that at a rate of about $5 million or plus year on trade spending, what we think is just totally inefficient. It is sometimes hard to... it is hard to cut trade spending when you are taking price increases. It's almost like a double price increase. If you’re able to trade and say, I'm taking prices of 5% and taking trade spending on 5%, that's a 10% price increase. So when years like it was in 2006 where there was a lot of price increases coming out of 2005, we generally backed off on taking trade spending reductions. So you might see this next year backing off a little on trade spending reductions because price increase are going on and it's just too much to absorb all at once. But we are... we analyze over 10,000 deals a year and figure out which ones work, which ones don't, and if they don't work we try to work with the trade to rework the deal or cut the deal. And it's been effective in helping and it’s part of our gross margin expansion opportunities. I can't talk to you [inaudible] microphone in your hand.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: It’s Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Just a little bonus formula for you guys, I think 75% doesn't really have a capital charge on it, so it's almost like it encourages you to do deals every single year. Have you noticed it, it’s like sales growth, gross margin, and operating profit, and there is no really capital charge except for the free cash flow? Is that intentional?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. Okay, well, first of all, our plans are built with known acquisitions. And so if there is new acquisitions are targets would all change.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, the resets [inaudible].
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: I didn't mention it, but our bonus structure changed slightly this year. It used to be 40% net revenue, 40% operating margin, 20% cash flow. This year, because gross margin is so important, we changed it to 25% net revenue, 25% gross margin, 25% operating margin, 25% cash flow. I honestly call 2008 the year of gross margin. And I’ve got... it's working so far. I’ve got marketing people talking about gross margin before they are talking about their marketing budgets because it is very critical with all these cost increases to drive that gross margin north. So we made it a bigger part of our bonus structure.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: And just in terms of sort of the timing of the charges that are coming off from last year like the transition cost on detergent, and also you had some pretty big growth in that spread in the first and second quarter of last year and I think this year you said it’s going to be fewer but bigger margins, is that fair?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, that's our goal. We had over 50 new product launches last year. Every new product launch costs a lot of money to get the product on the shelf. And so our goal, we did really good. We had a really great year. We had over $100 million of net revenue from those new product launches. We are seeking to do almost twice as much of revenue growth, but try to do as you just said, fewer but bigger new products and we think we have that in our portfolio. So we’ll be more vigilant. We've had more than we would like of product launches that were just $1 million to $2 million to $3 million of net sales and that doesn't cut anymore. We will not launch something even if it is net positive at that rate because it's just too expensive and too time consuming. So we’ve put the onus on the new product team to step up the ante and make sure the product launches we're doing are bigger even if it is fewer because I think we can get twice as much revenue growth off those new products with fewer if they are bigger in ideas.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Well, that might help.
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: One thing to add to that, when we launch new products we do slotting. And so typically, the slotting hits in the first half of the year, and in 2007 versus 2006 we had way more slotting in first half. You may remember, we might have been talking about that, '06 going to '07, so '07 going to '08 we have done slotting again, similar level of slotting in '08 versus '07 in the first half.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: That's not favorability because there are skewers that you’ll probably--?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, right. Exactly.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, and how about the transition costs, I know you're going to get $7.5 million from Orange Glo synergies next year, is that somewhere on those lines?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean the way… the right way to think about that is we have about $10 million of synergies from bringing our Orange Glo into our plants. So just by math, if you’ve got one quarter you probably get about 7 or 7.5 in 2008, so that's correct.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, and then how about the transition costs from the concentrate, are you lapping that next year, because I think probably the big upfront cost already happened? Is that fair?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, not necessarily, because one of the things, when you're starting to make big bottles and small bottles, right, of concentrate, non-concentrate… we have two plants, we’ve got one in Missouri, one in New Jersey. So we have transition expenses frankly, cross shipping, trying to get right where we're going to make the concentrated stuff and non-concentrated. So we got some hits from that in the fourth quarter, goofy things that can happen to us. If somebody got big bottles, they want move them out, they want markdowns from here, so that's going hit gross to net as well. So you are going have that happen now in wave two to wave three, but as you get into back half end of the year, is the way I’ll answer that.
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Got you. And then what happens to all these issued excess filling capacity right, because you’ve these big tanks, you’ve these been filling facilities, the bottle is small, you are putting a lot less liquid in, it seems like you’re going to have massive excess capacity accepted through the bottleneck filling part of the line?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Technically, there is Bill, but there was a lot before, there was a lot of excess capacity before this happened. So you just have to expect the industry to act rationally and I think it will. I hate to say it, but one benefit of commodity costs going higher, if you've in a business like laundry which is very commodity sensitive, you are not about to do ridiculous things on pricing when you’ve got… you are facing higher cost. I mean when this effort started, oil was about $70 a barrel. Now it is about $90, so some of the benefits compaction have been eaten up by the higher commodity. And just to add on to it, the math, the first wave of compaction, which was the southern half of United States, which started in this last September, that only was about 35% of our national volume. So to your point, this year we've got… about 65% of our volume will convert between the first and second quarters and then by the back half nearly a 100% conversion. And that would add to… the first wave is a little easier in some sense for national retailers out there. They could move large sizes from areas being converted to areas not converted by sending it through a third way. There is no place to check whole bigger bottles. So that might be a little bit more caustic and we're the only bigger bottle, so… but the good news is by the third quarter of the next year the whole country will be converted to small bottles. I will give you a little update on what we have learnt so far on compaction. The category growth has been… like category growth is a result of it. Unit pricing is holding, which is good. Shelf space is holding, which is good. And I would say to you, our sales are up nicely in the compacted markets, so we're happy. So overall... and overall I think the industry is very happy and the retailers are very happy with the compaction rollout, which has been as we've often said a win, win, win for everybody because we will win, because it will be… cost us less to make and shift these products. The retailers will win because it will cost them less to shift the product in their warehouse and to their stores, and the consumer wins because they will get the same number of wash loads and bottles that take less space in there shelves and less waste for their garbage removal services and things like that. So it is really a terrific effect going out there, and I think you're going to see it go across other categories. There is no need for retailers… or manufacturers and retailers who’s going to be shipping water. And I’d be honest with you, the old laundry bottles, the non-compactive [inaudible] in stores around here at New York because this is just the last way that it will happen in March. About 80% of that bottles is water, and everybody [inaudible]. So there is no need to be shipping you… eight-tenths of what you get is water. You can... the washing machine will add the water, so a good initiative, a very smart initiative. Who gets the microphone next, how about that side of the room?
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Hi, Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital. I'm trying to figure out how the quarters are going to flow this year? And as I'm looking at the year organic sales growth, it seems that your second half of 2008 has some really tough comps where 6% increase in the third quarter and 9% in the fourth. Are you budgeting for sales increases in the second half of the year or does most of the sales growth come in the first half from all the shipment of new products?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: No. We definitely building on share increases… or share and volume increase across all four quarters. We really feel we’ve got great momentum exiting this year. We have got great new products coming online. The new products will come on line mid to late second quarter. So really the second half of next year gets bulk of the benefit from the new products I talked about and that's why… you have a fair point, we’ve got some difficult comps to go over, but I think we can do that. So I'm very excited. The new product team has done a great job in putting out some exciting new products. We haven't told you all those new products by the way, we only will tell you new products that we've announced at a trade, there is more to come.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: So the slotting allowances, do they hit in the first or in the second quarter?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: More in the second than in the first, Connie. The other thing to think about when you think about the quarters, Q3 of 2007 you call is a big quarter for the company and we had a lot of help where we had a gain on a sale of a property in Canada, we had a tax benefit with about $0.06 help we got in the third quarter that obviously was not going to repeat in 2008. So that is probably the toughest comps, Q3.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: And then also, what is it that is going on in the specialty business? Why shouldn't gross margin contract early in the year from whatever is going on with that raw material, if it got hit so hard in the fourth quarter?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we’ve got price increases going on in that business, so we had this surcharge where we are trying to pass on the increase of that particular raw material dollar for dollar. We just haven’t been able to catch up to it as fast that has been going on. We think that it is going to… it’ll level as we move through the year.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks.
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The price of PFAD has also started to drop a little bit, so that will help.
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan Securities: Hi, Dara Mohsenian from JP Morgan. Getting back to compaction a minute, you mention topline benefits earlier in the early markets. Can you quantify exactly how much topline benefit you are seeing? And then second, can you run through the longer term cost savings you are expecting from compaction?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It is early on that. I would say we are seeing low to mid single-digit growth from that. It happens with most compaction efforts. The category is benefiting because consumer are very explicit as to usage instructions, which is to use half as much as they used to. They are overusing the product. And then our brands driven by the new product [inaudible] Arm & Hammer was OxiClean, was launched in the fourth quarter of last year right in the first initial wave and so that has been very helpful in growing our results. So that came out as one of the compacted forms. So we are benefiting both from industry trend and also from some new products that we had going out there. So low to mid-single digits, but it is till early but I’d rather have that than a sharp stick in the eye.
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan Securities: And the call savings longer term?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, we won't comment on that, because you know what, you tell what the price of oil will be? It is like I said, it has gone up $20 a barrel from where we started. I quoted you’re a number last August just before we started, I would have said actually you will be sitting here and telling me you didn’t get it, actually you missed it, I’d… I had to absorb $20 a barrel of oil. Resin costs have gone up since we have launched, and the resin price change almost everyday. So it is hard to put a number on it. I would just tell you, it is net positive assuming oil doesn’t go out of site further, it will be net positive move for us, but it will all vary on agrarian costs and diesel… what is the cost of diesel because that is what we’ve got to ship it. A lot of variables go into it, but it will be a net positive move if there is no further significant move in commodity prices.
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan Securities: Okay. And then on the gross margin line, it looked like the long term gross margin expansion in one of the slides it said 50% organic and 50% through acquisitions. Did I read that correctly, and does that mean the organic assumptions are lower than they were previously? And what is driving that?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I just saying to you… I mean I think first of all to call it 1000 point increase in gross margin, which what I am basically doing, I am saying we are roughly 39, 40 today, and our goal is to get the 50. You look at companies like Procter and Colgate, they are 50 to 55, and Colgate just… I don’t know, about 56 or something gross margin. Part of that is their… they have advantages in that they are all leading brands with high margins out there. We have part of our portfolio, which is value like laundry, which isn't going to have the same margins. But we honestly believe we can over a course of eight to ten years, increase our gross margin at the rate of 100 basis points and 120 basis points a year through a combination of organic, that's a lot, that's seeing 500 basis points of organic growth, and the other combination would be through buying gross margin positive acquisitions, that are higher than the company's average to start with. So I think it's very... a lofty goal to say I am going to grow my gross margin by 10 points. I don't think anybody else in the industry is going to claim that right now. And I think we can do that in the face of high commodity prices right now. But I must be honest with you, if it wasn't for acquisitions I would you 500 basis points I think is very achievable through organic. I'm just saying I think I can add another 500 through acquisitions. I don't what they are, Alice will tell me, but I am working on it. Next question?
Unidentified Analyst - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Good morning. [inaudible] from SunTrust. Last week one your competitors also announced price increases in powder detergent, do you intend to match that?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think that was old news, and we have taken price increases through sizing and compactions in powdered laundry, which are an even marketplace. But beyond that, we would look at it… I've also heard they've announced price increases in liquid laundry, which is brand new news, and I haven't had time to get the details on that to know how to react. I am just telling you, it's a wild time out there with commodities right now, and we are doing our best to stay on top of it. Like I said we lead in categories, we're number one and we follow all the categories. So we pick up the news sometimes as fast as you do and we’re very careful. We take a look at it, we just don't automatically follow in every case, we don't think it is good for our business. But when we think it's smart, we’ll follow in a smart way too. We just don't automatically match what they do, because sometimes you don’t want to cross certain [inaudible] where your volume will become will take a massive hit if you cross it. We have to study, I think it will take a little bit... my team is pretty quick and nimble, but we are just literally picking up some new news as you might be about to step out there. So if you have details about powder laundry price increase, I will be glad to take it afterwards.
Nik Modi - UBS Investment Research: Nik Modi from UBS. Jim, can you talk about the international business, any plans there to accelerate growth from here?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: As I told you, international is about 70% of revenue, 30% of operating income. We've had nice growth. It's mostly a personal care business, and we’ve got good situations in Western Europe, North America. We’re starting to get some penetration in South America, and just starting to get entries into China. We are careful. I would tell you, within that mix the biggest opportunity surprisingly enough are in pricing North America, our Canadian and Mexican subs are doing very well, and so we are pushing that hard. And then we are carefully exploring new markets, so China is a huge opportunity, but it can also be a huge place to lose a lot of money in the short term. As I said, we have three that our best business in there right now. We picked by business there when we bought OxiClean, we picked up business there when we bought SpinBrush, and just we ended China through a distributor relationship with many distributors, but there is no one distributor in China to launch our Trojan condom business at premium end of the condom category. So we are placing our bets, but I would still tell you we saw tremendous growth opportunities throughout North America. The US I still have probably more opportunity than most customer packages companies. We are so close in distribution voids on some of our major brand like OxiClean, SpinBrush, even Arm & Hammer has voids out there we’re closing in. As our brands grow with great new products and strength, the voids that are left we’re closing. You won’t find… some of the bigger players are out of easy lay-ups like that out there. We still have those, and we certainly have even bigger growth opportunities in Canada and Mexico. I don’t want to go into details, but there is some of our core businesses in the United States are not as strong in those two markets and we believe we can get them there by launching and better supporting the products out there. So that's the lot easier to grow your business in North America than just overseas where there is a lot more difficult trade situation or costs and things like that and our brands aren’t strong in some of those markets. But I feel that international got a very good growth, very good contributor, and as we look at acquisition again we’re agnostic that if there’s good acquisitions overseas we’ll make them, but I am not… I won't say my first priority is international acquisitions, it’s not. I don't… I just want great number one and number two brands with the opportunity to grow and to plug into our system and where they fall, what countries, I will just take them as they come and only do the ones that make sense.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks. Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. First, how does the trade react when you basically expand gross margin in your consumer businesses this quarter, talk about 1000 basis point increase in gross margin over the next few years and then turn around and try to take pricing in some of these category?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: They’re capitalists also. As I told you, they will benefit from the laundry compaction big time from all the stripping costs they’ll save. So we are capitalists and we all do that. We are working with them, trust me, growing their gross margins is usually the first priority in their eyes. So we work with them on ways to do that. It just work, it works. I believe I didn't… we’re are not going to go a 1000 points in one year. This is going to be through a lot of initiatives over time and I think we are entitled to keep the ones where we paid the money in our products and on word we help them not on saving on there end too. So it is a good relationship between the two sides. And we have great relationships with almost all of our retailers out there. You’re going to see us bring to market from new ideas, which I think will really… will change the rule or some categories out there, which the retailers will truly appreciate. I don't want to go into any more news about that, but we know… you’ve heard about the sustainable trend out there, it is huge. I was at a conference in Washington recently with the Grocery Manufacturers Association. That was all about sustainability at the environmentally friendly world. They expected 200 people to attend. They had over 600 attendees from every major CPG company, every major retailer, a lot of suppliers there, it is just unbelievable what's happening. The bottom line what's happening is sustainability of our [inaudible] has gone from a world of the tree huggers where you had products that cost a lot more to make and didn't perform as well as mainstream products. It's going to a world now where the manufacturers have figured out how to make products that are environmentally friendly, that are just as good in their efficacy as initial products that only cost a little bit more, and the population has just loves it. And we've been shocked by this central product line we launched, which is at the request of our... the laundry detergent, which is at the request of one of our major retailers. We launched it and the reaction of unbelievable. And we have taken that idea now, we’re spreading across the entire ARM & HAMMER line, and we are looking at other areas. That was some shocking news, some facts that I just love. If everybody country in this country, everybody, changed all the light bulbs in their house from traditional incandescent light bulbs to [inaudible] ones, you’ve to close a power plant in every state. Safeway has already converted 25 of their stores to solar power. The entire roof of the store is solar panel. Safeway was very progressive in this area, has already converted their 1000-truck trucking fleet into biodiesel trucks. It just recently saved them a lot of money. So there is a book out there I’d encourage you to read called Green to Gold, and that's what it is. Green is the new black and the green on the environmental move is very hot it’s funny because it's a way to do it that… we’re all well environmentally conscious, socially conscious, but the way to do it to be is to be good capitalists also. So everybody has figured out how to go green and make more money. So the manufactures love it the retailers love it and the consumers love it. So it's a very hot trend. I think it will be around, it won’t just be a one-year wonder. I think you are going to see this go on for some time now, and you’re going to se go on for some time now and you're going to see the explosion of green… the environmentally friendly products in the market place that are truly as good or better products than what’s out there right now, that might cost you a little bit more, but the consumer is willing to pay that little bit more for a better… for products that are environmentally friendly. So we’re hot and heavy on that trend. We’re already into it, and you will see a lot more coming out of this.
Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.: And then second, back in December you and I had this discussion about consumer and their ability to take additional price increases, given the economy. It seems like since then the date has been worsening, not getting better. What is your sense of how the consumer today is going to be able to handle this round or maybe another round later this year?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I think it's shocking. I saw… I’m just repeating, you might have seen Wall Street Journal [inaudible] the other day reported, they had checked the major price increases and they said that the average food bill in an average family in America is going to grow forward $400 next year just from higher food costs out there. I don't know, Joe, it is concerning. Obviously, I’ve told my company, if there is recession we’re going to choose not to participate. So we’re just going to go… thankfully, we have products, which are... everybody uses everyday. So we are not in the fast food business, we are not in the expensive apparel business, and that I am very happy to be in the everyday product needs business and keep supplying people with great things. But that we haven't really seen an effect so far. But I am… I may be, I am glad to be in the value side of the laundry businesses. If people want to shave a few bucks off your laundry bill, they can buy ARM & HAMMER or extra laundry detergents. They are great products and they cost a lost less than the guy in the big orange bottle, so anyways.
Unidentified Analyst: Could you just quantify pricing in your organic growth of 9% in the fourth quarter in 5% for the year?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the 9% would be 8 and 1 roughly… eight and one, just rounded. 8% volume and 1% would be price.
Unidentified Analyst: And the five is?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Full-year basis?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it would be more… actually we would do price less mix. We got that fine, we can cut it just price. So that nine, eight being volume, the one is price and mix that’s baked in there. And you are also talking about the five for 2007?
Unidentified Analyst: Right I guess.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Full year?
Unidentified Analyst: Zero price mix?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: No, there would actually be some prize… negative price mix in that number, in the five.
Unidentified Analyst: Like one negative?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, roughly.
Unidentified Analyst: And just a follow-up to specialty division, how much of that 31% increased price?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: The way to think about that is half of it is volume, just say 50%. Another 25% is just regular price and the other 25% is that surcharge I talked about related to PFAD.
Unidentified Analyst\: Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: It’s Connie Maneaty again. I have some… I was hoping you would comment on what's going on with resins. Are you a believer that new capacity that's coming on will cost this to moderate? Secondly, have you increased your number of resin suppliers, and are you riding short of contracts now than you did when resin was in very short supply?
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the last two are going to be tough to comment on, Connie, because we wouldn't announce publicly how many suppliers we will be talking to in our… what our tactics would be with respect to negotiating. As far as the first question goes, there is a great belief frankly that because there is new capacity coming on in the Middle East in 2009, I think it will be online in 2008, that will not begin supplying Asia that the ability for U.S. companies to export will be will be diminished to Asia, this is resin. The second thing is that because the economy is falling off, automotive, housing, accelerate, less demand for resin, as a result it's going to... so less demand, it's going to give less ability to negotiate. So we do think that there is some hope with respect to what we have been experiencing with the steady increase in resent prices over the past year or so, but we do think it will abate eventually.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Any benefit in 2008, or it's more 2009?
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, as Matt said right now literally the huge slump in housing in housing and automotive is causing a big enough drop in demand that there's news of some resin price increases being resented and stuff like that. So there is actually some… that was… those who are increases we weren’t planning when we started the year. So they started to come back, that’ll just get us back to where we were starting from, but that is the recessionary impact the slump in those markets could help 2008.
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you.
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Have we worn you out? One more thing from... Connie, I though we were going to get a little more in the [inaudible] there on something else, and I haven’t been asked about what's the tax rate for 2008. So I had ten people ask when we conclude. The tax rate for 2007 was 36.2%. So when I stood up here last year, we were estimating 36% to 36.5%, so not bad. So what we are using for 2008 is 37%, and the reason for that is because you probably know that once again the R&D tax credit has not been approved by Congress. So we are in the exact same position that we were in 2006, that's A. And B, just expect higher profitability in the US, that’s where we have the highest tax rate. So I would expect that if you wanted a range, it would be 36.5% to 37%, bit more likely to be to be in the high end of the range.
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I want to thank you. I just want to summarize, my company is doing great, we’ve got great momentum exiting last year, we’ve got a lot of good things going on this year, and we’re really optimistic. And the Giants won the Super Ball again. We'll be back here next year for another [inaudible]. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation into this conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2007 Q3  (2007-11-07 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  James R. Craigie - Chairman and CEO Matthew T. Farrell - EVP, Finance and CFO

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on today's conference call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding amongst other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC fillings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Jam Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead sir. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you operator and good morning everyone. It's always a pleasure to talk to you particularly when we have good results to report. I will start off by giving you a brief summary of our third quarter results. I will then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with the financial details of the third quarter. When Matt is finished I will provide some further information on the factors driving our key business units. Finally I will provide earnings guidance before we open the call to field questions from you.  Overall we were very please with our third quarter business results. Reported net sales were up 12% versus year ago. Organic net sales, which exclude the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange, were up a strong 6% versus year ago. The organic net sales growth reflects solid gains in all three of our reported business units, including record quarterly sales for our international and specialty products businesses. These gains were driven by the improved pipeline of new products, increased marketing spending and excellent sales execution, which led to record shares across many of our key brands. We are also beginning to reduce the drag on organic growth caused by some of our smaller brands through a stepped up efforts to slow the rate of decline.  Gross margins were up 40 basis points from year ago to 39.5% of net sales for the quarter. The improved gross margins in the face of significant commodity headwinds reflect our continuing focus on managing costs, implementing price increases, and leveraging scale.  And finally, our earnings per share increased 32% over the year ago quarter to $0.75 per share. These excellent results have put us in a position for another year of record sales, profits and earnings per share in 2007.  I will provide more detail on our business unit results and my outlook for the year in a few minutes. I will now turn the call over to Matt who will provide you with greater details on the financial results for the third quarter. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Thank you Jim and good morning everybody. I will start with the headlines. Third quarter EPS was $0.75 per share compared to $0.57 in 2006. The exceptionally strong sales performance is really the biggest driver of our third quarter earnings results. It's also noteworthy that results include approximately $0.04 of earnings from a property sale in Canada and $0.02 of tax benefits, which lowered our effective tax rate below 36%.  I will start with revenues. Revenues up 12%, of which 1% was due to foreign currency changes, 5% due to the OGI acquisition, if you will recall, we acquired it in August of 2006, and a 6% organic growth. Now about 1% of our organic growth may be attributed to the initial shipments of concentrated liquid laundry detergent in September, but all things considered, this was a very healthy quarter for organic growth.  Now I am going to say a few words about each of the segments. The domestic business had a strong quarter led by Arm & Hammer liquid laundry, cat litter and SpinBrush. Trojan, Arm & Hammer, carpet deodorizer, and Arm & Hammer dental care were also up year-over-year. However, offsetting the quarterly growth were declines in other toothpastes and antiperspirants.  International performed well, led by Canada, France, and Brazil. And finally specialty products business had a solid quarter due to strong demand coupled with the price increase for our dairy nutrition product and also higher volumes and pricing in the specialty chemical business.  And now gross margin, our third quarter gross margin was 39.5%. That's a 40 basis point expansion versus last year. Cost reduction programs and pricing contributed to margin expansion despite higher costs for material inputs such as resin, corrugated paper, and diesel, just to name a few.  Looking ahead to Q4, we again expect year-over-year gross margin to expand as we realize the OGI manufacturing benefits. I am sure we will spend more time on that during Q&A.  And now marketing, marketing spend was 12% of revenues, that's comparable to the prior year spend rate of 12.1%. The marketing expense was up about $7 million over the year ago, partially driven by the OGI acquisition. Now a portion of our planned marketing spend has shifted from Q3 to Q4. This is in part to match our advertising with the expanding distribution of our new products. Our third quarter spend was about $70 million and we expect to easily exceed that level of spend in the fourth quarter.  Now SG&A, SG&A was down year-over-year due to a $3.3 million gain on the sale of property in Canada. So if you exclude that gain, our SG&A as a percentage of sales decline 100 basis point to 12.8% and this reflects continued cross control and leverage from the OGI acquisition. Our SG&A for the past two quarters has been about $74 million to $75 million per quarter. That excludes the Canadian gain from Q3. The fourth quarter, however, will be much higher due to the charge related to a reorganization of our Canadian business, which is mentioned in the press release, and also several R&D projects that require heavier spending in the fourth quarter.  Moving now to operating profit, the operating margin for the quarter expanded 140 basis point to 14.7%, excluding the gain on the property sale. And the operating margin expansion is driven by higher gross margins and SG&A leverage.  Now, other income expense decreased primarily due to translation gains caused by the decline in the dollar during the quarter. So the weakening US dollar also contributed to earnings in Q3.  Next is income taxes. As you can see in the release, our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%, which is lower than the expected 36% rate. This is due to the reduction of tax liabilities at one of our foreign subsidiaries. And while I am on the topic of effective tax rate, we are forecasting an effective rate of approximately 36% for the fourth quarter.  Not free cash flow. We generated $123 million of free cash flow so far in the first nine months of the year. Our total debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA for our bank agreement was approximately 2.3 at quarter-end. So we are comfortably within our long-term target range of two to three times EBITDA.  If you look at the balance sheet, you can see that we built our cash position in the third quarter rather than reduce our term bank debt. We ended the quarter with $179 million of cash on the balance sheet and this affords us more flexibility in making bolt-on acquisitions without needing to access the credit markets.  Turning now to other elements of the balance sheet, accounts receivable are up approximately $23 million versus a year ago. That's primarily due to higher sales in the quarter and the effective foreign currency changes. Same is true for inventories. Inventories increased about $13 million versus a year ago, a biggest reason for that again would be currency. It's also noteworthy that we have now transitioned the manufacturing of OGI products from co-packers to our plants.  So, in conclusion, a short summary for the third quarter would be a 6% organic sales growth, 40 basis points of gross margin expansion, good SG&A leverage, successful new product performance and strong free cash flow.  Now, back to you Jim. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thanks Matt. I would now like to provide you with details on each of our three key business units. Our domestic business unit, our international business unit, and our specialty products business unit to give you a better sense of what's driving the company's results.  Please note that when I mention consumption, I am talking about all channel consumption, which includes the traditional food and drug channels as measured by Nielsen. plus our actual retail consumption results or actual sales results in other sales channel not mentioned by Nielsen such as Wal-Mart, Dollar Stores and Club. These non-measured channels are growing faster than the measured channels, and they represent almost 40% of our company's total consumption and even greater than that on some of our brands. Thus what you see at Nielsen share and consumption results is often a misleading indicator of the actual total consumption occurring for some of our categories and brands.  Okay, let's first talk about our domestic business unit. Total net sales of this business unit grew 10% in the third quarter over the prior year period, of which about 6% was driven by the impact of the Orange Glo acquisition and 4% was organic.  Organic net sales were driven by sales gains in liquid laundry detergent, cat litter, condoms, Arm & Hammer toothpaste, SpinBrush, carpet deodorizers, and depilatories. These sales gains were partially offset by declines in powdered laundry detergents, antiperspirant, and value toothpaste.  Overall, we are very pleased with the organic growth in our domestic business unit, driven by innovative new products, improved marketing programs, expanded distribution and improved merchandising.  On the new product front, we are beginning to see the benefits of our corporate new product team that was created in 2006 to deliver more innovative consumer products with strong consumer appeal. Last year, this group produced great new products like the new Arm & Hammer fridge fresh refrigerator deodorizer and the Arm & Hammer high performance cat litter made from the actual ingredients. These new products are continuing to experience strong sales gains in 2007.  This year the new product team's effort has resulted in a record number of new product launches, 50 total, including the following. Arm & Hammer Essentials liquid laundry detergent, which is formulated from plant-based surfactants and baking soda to deliver the same powerful cleaning capability as regular Arm & Hammer detergent. This new product has shown very strong appeal among environmentally conscious consumers. We've expanded this concept in a fabric softeners with the launch of Arm & Hammer Essentials fabric softener sheet, which is also off to a strong start.  We have also launched a highly innovative Arm & Hammer cat litter called Odor Alert. This clumping cat litter contains crystals that change color when activated by the cat's urine so the consumer can see and remove the soiled cat litter before they smell it. As our new commercial for this product states, if your cat litter doesn't change color, then it's time to change your cat litter.  These new Arm & Hammer products are being supported by increased levels of marketing spending behind the new Arm & Hammer mega brand marketing campaign that we started in 2006. This marketing campaign in combination with the innovative new product has driven net sales growth for all Arm & Hammer brands from 1% in 2004 to over 5% in 2007. This improved sales growth reflects record market shares in 2007 on our Arm & Hammer laundry detergent, baking soda, and cat litter businesses.  We have also launched innovative new products in our other core categories including a new Trojan Intense Ribbed condom, a new subline of Nair depilatory products called Pretty, which is especially formulated for the more sensitive skin of young girls in their teens and 20s. And also three new SpinBrush toothbrushes, including a unique two-speed version to enable both gum massage and brushing, and our first rechargeable SpinBrush.  The new products and marketing programs have enabled us to maintain category leadership in battery-powered toothbrushes, regain leadership in depilatory category, and expand our category leadership in condoms. Our new products team has also quickly applied its skills to our latest acquisition by developing and launching two new OxiClean products.  First, a new OxiClean portable stain remover that instantly dissolves most stains. The portable instant stain remover segment is a new and fast growing segment and we expect that the launch of this new product under the popular OxiClean brand name will have strong consumer appeal. Second, we are in the process of launching an Arm & Hammer laundry detergent that includes the stain fighting benefits of the OxiClean brand. This new co-branded and premium-priced product builds on the category trend towards 2-in-1 products. It will be available in liquid and powder form and delivers premium laundry detergent cleaning performance at a value price. Trade acceptance to-date has been very strong and we plan to support the launch with significant levels of dedicated TV and print advertising starting in this fourth quarter.  The OxiClean brand has achieved record shares in the first nine months of 2007 as a result of improved merchandising, increased distribution, and continued strong marketing support on the base OxiClean business. These two new products are expected to continue to drive record sales and share results on OxiClean going forward.  As mentioned earlier, the solid growth that we achieved in the first quarter on laundry detergent, cat litter, condom, Arm & Hammer toothpaste, SpinBrush, carpet deodorizer and depilatories was partially offset by declines, particularly in antiperspirants and value toothpaste. These are tough categories in which we face exceptionally strong competitors with significant scale advantages. However, about six months ago, we created a new team of gorilla marketers and a supporting cross-functional team to stem the decline in these categories. This team was too new to have an effect in the first half of 2007 since that timeframe was driven by customer decisions made before the team was formed. However, this team was able to begin to reduce our sales declines in these tough categories starting in the third quarter and is expected to continue to be reduce the decline of these brands in the fourth quarter and in 2008.  Overall, we are very pleased with the solid organic sales growth of our domestic business units. Our efforts to launch innovative new products, supported by more impactful marketing campaigns and increased spending is working. However, we are not satisfied and expect to launch bigger and better new products in the future to keep up with the demands of our consumers and to stay a step ahead of our competitors.  Finally I want to mention that Church & Dwight is fully supporting the industry-wide initiative to reduce the water content in liquid laundry detergents by moving to concentrated offerings. The rollout of concentrated line extension began this September in the southern half of the United States. So far, this rollout has gone very smoothly and the results are in line with expectation in terms of reactions by our customers, our competitors and most importantly, our consumers. If everything continues to go well, this initiative will be a winner for our customers, our consumers, and for manufacturers. We will complete the national launch to all retailers by mid-2008.  Now let me talk for a minute about our two other business units. Our International business units and our Specialty Product division. Our International business unit, which represents over 18% of our total sales had an excellent third quarter and broke through the $100 million level in net sales fourth quarter for the first time. This represents a 13% increase in total sales over the prior year. When acquisitions and foreign exchange are included, this translates into 3% organic growth. This increase was driven by strong sales result in Canada, Australia, France and Brazil.  On international front, I also want to note two important initiatives. First, we recently launched the Trojan brand in China and distribution is growing in key accounts and pharmacies. Second, we are reorganizing our Canadian subsidiary to streamline our total company within North America. The Canadian organizational restructuring will incur a fourth quarter charge of approximately $0.04 per share, but will generate cost savings in 2008. The improved organic growth, market expansions, and organizational restructuring in our international business unit reflects improved coordination between all functions in our domestic international units to leverage new product innovations, improved marketing campaigns, and supply chain best practices.  Now on our Specialty Products business unit, which represents about 11% of total company sales, net sales grew 22% over the last year's third quarter on a reported and organic basis. This significant growth was driven larger by strong demand by dairy farmers for our animal nutrition products despite recent price increases. Specialty Products also benefited from increased sales of our product in Brazil driven by the strengthening Brazilian economy.  Now let me switch gears to talk about the future. While we are pleased with the solid third quarter results, we are never satisfied. First, in terms of dealing with the issues, we have been able to absorb on unprecedented level of cost increases for raw materials, packaging and transportation since 2004 and still deliver solid gross margin improvement and earnings growth.  We have a well organized pipeline of cost savings initiatives in the areas of manufacturing, purchasing, and distribution that are being executed, and along with price increases taken in 2005, 2006, and 2007, have enabled us to more than offset the commodity cost increases. As we look forward, these cost saving initiatives will be bolstered by manufacturing synergies from the recently completed Orange Glo integration, liquid laundry and detergent compaction, volume scale leverage, and planned price increases on selected products in 2008. The net affect of all these initiatives will lead to further steady improvements in our gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2007 and will enable us to achieve our annual gross margin goal of 125 basis points of growth in 2008.  The improvement in our gross margin will also enable us to increase market spending in the fourth quarter of 2007 and in 2008. We will focus this increased marketing spending behind the strong pipeline of new product innovations at every one of our core category.  As I stated earlier, these new products increased spending have resulted in record sales and shares in 2007 in many of our key categories. We are very pleased with the results, but we know that we must continue to improve on all fronts and continue to stem the decline in categories where we are weak.  We will also continue to drive growth in our international markets by leveraging our new products and marketing program into all applicable worldwide markets, while at the same time improving the efficiency of our worldwide supply chain through implementation of best practices.  Now let me translate this into specific guidance for the rest of the year. In view of our solid organic revenue growth, gross margin improvement and overhead expense control action in the third quarter, we are confident that these trends will continue in to the fourth quarter. As a result, we are raising our previously announced 2007 earnings per share forecast from $2.34 to $2.36 to$2.42 to $2.44. This goal includes the $0.04 per share gain in the sale of property in Canada. The $2.42 to $2.44 earnings per share forecast is equivalent to a 70% to 80% increase over 2006 results.  Now before I close I would like to comment on Unilever's announcement that it intends to sell its North American laundry business. Generally we do not comment on specific acquisition opportunity. However, in this case I want to remind you and inform the following. We will adhere to our practice of making business decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our company. We have a great record with the acquisitions that we've made. We've being very successful in growing our laundry detergent business, both organically and through acquisitions such as the recent purchase of OxiClean.  And finally, we are extremely confident that we will able to continue to properly grow our laundry business, regardless of the future ownership of Unilever's North American laundry business.  In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and first nine months results for 2007, and we feel confident that we can deliver our new EPS forecast of the year.  Now that ends our presentation. I'll now open the call to any questions that you may have with Matt and I will do our best to answer. I do want to mention that due to travel commitments, Matt and I are in different locations. So, we may have to call a few audibles on the phone as to who takes the lead in answering your questions. Operator, please go ahead.  Question And Answer 
Operator:  Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Please proceed. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Hi. Good morning. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Hi Alice. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Hi. First of all, the quarter was clearly an upside surprise and you had warned us about the cost of shipping to compaction. Can you tell us what in the quarter, if anything, was ahead of your expectations? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, Alice, this is Matt. I think that anybody who is looking at our performance in this quarter is going to see that we had outsized earnings, but I think that we had pretty high expectations for sales in the second half because remember we said we thought that we would be able to head our 3% to 4% full year earnings target. There may have been some skepticism with respect to that externally, but from our point of view we expected to get there and right now we are on track to be there for the full year. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay. Can you tell us how much pricing was in the organic number? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Just a percent? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, it's mostly volume because we do have some price increases and the decreases that net, but I'd say in general that 6% is largely driven by volume year-over-year. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay. So maybe 1% to 2% pricing in there? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  No, it wouldn't even be as high as 2%. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay. And are you planning any further... what are your pricing plans for next year? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, well, we estimate there will be pricing about 20% of our total revenue base in 2008, and this could go higher based on where commodity prices settle out and what competitors' actions are. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  But for the time being, we should assume 1% to 2% pricing for next year too? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  No, I wouldn't call it that way. I would just say that... it's 20% of our revenue base that we are looking at. You can translate that anyway you want, the percentage of the price increase will vary from one category to the next. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay. And is... are OxiClean sales coming in on or ahead of your expectations or below, I guess? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Alright. The OGI acquisition is performing extremely well, it's... many measures, it's at or above our expectations. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay. And I guess my last question and then I'll give up will be in compaction, are you seeing price per load holding up or coming through as you had expected in the shift to compaction? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Alice, This is Jim. We pretty much have seen it come in as we expected and it's holding up very well. I think sometimes people get fooled by looking at which is the normal merchandising taking place out there, but as far as we see on averages it's holding up with expectations and where it was. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay, thanks a lot. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with Wachovia Capital Markets. Please Proceed. 
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LCC:  Good morning. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Hi Jason. 
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LCC:  Just in general, I mean, going back on compaction, can you just talk about... I mean, how you feel in general with the first wave? I know the costs initially ran a little bit higher maybe two quarters ago than what you were anticipating. So as you go to the second wave, can you just give a little bit more color on the whole process? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Jason, it's Jim. It's going very smoothly, the retailer reaction has been excellent. They are in the process of resetting shelves, which vary from retailer to retailer. The manufacturers are all supporting it. Pricing is holding as we see it and the move's going very well. Secondly wave starts in mid-January of next year, third wave, the final wave starts in mid-April. Consumer reaction so far has been pretty much in line with what we expected and based on test markets. And everything seems to go well. As we've said, this is one of those moves which everybody can win on, both the consumers, the customers, and the manufacturer, and everything so far is very much in line with what we' expected. 
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LCC:  Can you quantify what, I guess, the transition costs were in the quarter? Are you able to break that out? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, Jason, this is Matt. I wouldn't say that we're... our systems are so fine that we can quantify that, but there is a fair amount of expense internally as you shift from one process to another within our detergent plan. 
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LCC:  Okay. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  I wouldn't hang a number on it. 
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LCC:  Okay. And then just in terms of commodity costs, can you break out what the actual impact on gross margins were in the quarter owing to material costs? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  I think a better way to do it might be if you think about what we... our evergreen target has been 125 basis points of expansion on an annual basis and that is something that's not going to change in the future. I think next year our goal is going to be 100 to 125 basis points. But within this year, a logical question would be why were we unable to get or did we say we can get as high as 125 basis points. And the number one reason would be compaction, the second thing would be that the... actually number one reason is commodities; number two is compaction, it comes later than we originally expected. But I'd say it's easy to see that the lion share of the miss between our evergreen target and where we think we're going to come out will be driven by commodities. 
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LCC:  Okay. And then last question, certainly intrigued by Trojan in China and can you talk about the marketing there and I guess what you think is going to be more difficult getting on primetime in the US or reaching out to consumers out in China? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Definitely latter will be, Jason. I mean, actually there is no TV advertising allowed in China on condoms by the government. So it's much more point-of-sales like type marketing going on over there. So right now we're in the basis of through a distributor building our distribution base in key markets over there. And marketing in the best way we can within the rules and limitations of the government there. 
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LCC:  Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Hi. Good morning, guys. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Hi Bill. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Hi. If you look at your peer group, everyone has a pretty tepid growth in North America, then you guys came out and had some pretty strong numbers. On the laundry side, is there a trade down going on, are people trading down for more of the premium stuff to some of your brands? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  It's a good question, though we can't quantify that. Certainly when you're in the value side of any business, you're hoping when the economy is getting pretty rough out there you might benefit from it. But we can't put a finger on that, so we would hope that might happen. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Okay. Are there any plans in place to kind of encourage that? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, stick right where we are. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  That was helpful. And then you said 20% of portfolio is taking pricing. Can you tell us what brands are going to take pricing? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, Bill, this is Matt. We wouldn't call that just yes, simply because we'd have to notify the trade in advance. So we wouldn't talk about that on an earnings call. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Okay. Because it seems the most impacted is liquid laundry obviously and can you take laundry pricing in light of all this compaction change going on with the consumer? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Well, we are not specifically focused on laundry, but certainly that would be high on our list because as you point out, the commodities are affecting laundry more than any other category. I mean, the two biggest of swingers for us are resin and diesel, and they are the two that are most unpredictable, but obviously we would be reacting to what our competitors do as well in pricing in laundry. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Okay, great. And then just on Unilever thing, the Unilever laundry business, it was sort of cryptic what your prepared comments. I think from a synergy perspective, obviously makes great sense. And I think you have to get tons of cost out, I mean, is there something you would look at, it wasn't very clear in your comments? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, we would not comment on M&A activity. I think that was just a general comment and they were meant to be general by Jim. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Okay. And the point again is that you are okay with it, you are okay without it, kind of is that because I didn't understand what your comment was in there? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Bill, I just wanted the world... we have done very well on our acquisitions in the past. And I want to make sure everybody understood that we will be doing well with or without the Unilever acquisition. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Sorry, tax rate for next year is 36%, probably the right rate to use in the models? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, I mean, for now. We would... we will update that in February when we come out with 2008. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Okay. Great. Thanks so much. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question is from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Good morning. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Hi Bill. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  I guess, first on the specialty business, it's a little bit tougher one to track or forecast, but would you expect the trends in terms of top line growth to continue for the next few quarters? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  It's a tough one to call, Bill. It is highly dependent on the dairy farmers and the situation out there and there has been some significant price increases, but generally I don't know if they will be as high as they were recently, but generally we see some positive momentum there. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Hey, Bill, just to add to that, keep in mind that there is some pricing that's driving that as well. But the pricing is simply enabling us to catch up to some significant increases in some of the inputs that would be palm oil based. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Sure. And would that business be part of the potential 20% of the pricing next year? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, it could be. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  And then am I right in saying that there is no real advertising promotion related to that business, is there? So, you get some good leverage in the quarter from that growth? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, that's true. There is very little marketing in SPD. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Okay. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  But their margins are half what the consumer domestic business is. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  So it could... the growth will also bring down kind of the gross margins too. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, that's true. Yes, that has a negative effect on the consolidated gross margins as SPD, as the specialty products business grows. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Okay. And then if you look at A&P and kind of your comments of stepping it up in the fourth quarter and into next year, is this something that all along you've planned or you are running ahead of schedule now so you can reinvest more in the business or are you seeing something out there where you feel like you need to put foot on the gas a little bit more? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  It's a good question. You may recall that earlier in the year, we thought that Q3 and Q4 might be more level, and that's not the case right now. A few reasons for that, but I mean, the number one would be marketing. If you look at the first couple of quarters of this year, you would see that our marketing spend as a percent of sales increased year-over-year. It did not happen in the third quarter and the reasons for that is frankly we are just trying to time our advertising spend with the distribution that we are gaining on a lots of our new products. So it makes a lot more sense for it to have shipped from Q3 to Q4 so that's prudent. But the other things that are happening why Q4 would be far lower than Q3 is as you have the timing of marketing spend, we have some R&D projects and big ones that are concluding in the fourth quarter. And we normally have a fall off in sales from Q3 to Q4. So, if you go back historically, you will see that as well. And that's for the total company. And the last thing would be we have a charge in the fourth quarter for Canada. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Bill, this is Jim. I would also add to that. We accelerated the launch of Arm & Hammer laundry detergent with OxiClean because of the test results were so terrific that we wanted to get that out there as fast as possible. So, that was one thing that wasn't quite in our initial plan, but we put that out there early to get a go and we are going to be spending some significant marketing dollars behind that. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Okay. Great. Nice quarter. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with CIBC World Markets. Please proceed. 
Joseph Altobello - CIBC World Markets:  Thanks. Good morning, guys. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Hi Joe. 
Joseph Altobello - CIBC World Markets:  Just one question actually for Matt. If you go back to sort of where guidance was earlier this year, the $2.34 to $2.36. You guys have talked about 3% to 4% organic growth and you probably will be at the high end of that range assuming a 6% organic number, let's say, in 4Q. So you are in that range. The gross margin looks like it's going to be down versus the 125 bps obviously that you talked about earlier this year. So, it seems like you guys are making a lot of progress on the SG&A front, much lower than what I was looking for. Could you just give a little color as to what's going on in that line to basically drive the earnings growth that we are seeing? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Are you talking about specifically SG&A, Joe? 
Joseph Altobello - CIBC World Markets:  Yes. I mean, beyond marketing obviously. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes. Frankly it's simply vigilance with respect to holding the line on SG&A, as simple as that. Part of our model is to keep a lid on SG&A and to grow our top line much faster than rise in our SG&A. And we are going to achieve that this year and in the future. 
Joseph Altobello - CIBC World Markets:  I mean, clearly it seems like you guys are doing much better than at least you anticipated as early as May. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Well, we expected to do very well on the SG&A line this year because we have a lot of process in place to monitor that within the company. 
Joseph Altobello - CIBC World Markets:  Okay. And lastly if I could, just probably a small number, but what are Trojan sales in China at this point? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  As you know, we don't quote sales of any of our brands that specifically. 
Joseph Altobello - CIBC World Markets:  Okay, great, thanks. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Good morning. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Hi Connie. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  About the Canadian streamlining, is there one charge or will there be charges next year? And what how do you quantify the benefit and what's the date for a completion? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Okay. Connie, that's just in the fourth quarter and what it relates to is we are going to be more closely integrating the Canadian business into our US supply chain. So sales and marketing will still be handled locally up there. We are also going to be exiting some distributor agreements up in Canada and so we will have some census reduction and the charge will relate to both census reduction and to the exit of the distribution agreement. And we expect that to have a pretty good payback within 18 months. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Okay. I am sorry, you are exiting the distribution and what was the other thing, census reduction? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, I said we are going to be taking some people out in Canada, so that's pat of this reorganization. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Okay. On compaction, in the markets where it's been launched, what are you seeing in terms of repeat purchase or have consumers just loaded the pantries with the old stuff? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  It's pretty early to call that Connie, but so far we're seeing pretty normal repeat purchase, but it is difficult right now. There is still in some cases both non-compacted and compacted product on the shelves. But we're not sensing any stampede to shelves to buy the compacted products. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Okay. What is the market in China for condoms like at the moment? Are there are a lot of local brands? Is there any one that's dominant and what do peg the market potential of the category to be? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  It's a hard one Connie. It's mostly a government supplied market. The premium side of business is relatively small, but as that country has rapidly changing as we all know, we see the premium side and the branded side growing rapidly in the future. So, I don't want to give a number, but we all know the potential if that continues to happen, that's everybody is rushing to get over there and we are taking our best brand that has significant opportunity there. But it's way too early. And I think it was Jason's really comments, I would not say this is going to have any kind of significant impact on our earnings certainly for... not for next year. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Okay. And do you have any early thoughts, I mean, you started to give some thoughts on 2008, but can you give us a sense of your outlook for organic sales growth, commodity pressure, things like that? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, hi, Connie, this is Matt. We normally provide all that guidance in February. But it is fair to say that we have been pretty consistent in what our corporate goals are, in that we annually want to have a target of 3% to 4% top line and I think with respect to gross margins of 100 to 125 basis point expansion, I think those are two things that will probably not change and that will be our target for 2008. But we will be far more specific in February. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  And then I guess just one follow-on question. With the rollout of Arm & Hammer with OxiClean. Should we expect that marketing spending would be very heavy, not only in the fourth quarter, but also the first quarter of '08? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Thanks. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  That's accurate. So I think we'll see a lot more marketing spend in the next two quarters, Q4 and Q1. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Okay. Thank you very much. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you. 
Operator:  You have a follow-up question from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Please proceed. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Hi. Could you tell us what your organic growth was in detergents, if put the liquid and powder together? Were the detergents up in line with your 6% organic growth? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  I don't know that I have it that fine for you, Alice, but that.. both categories are up as well. But I wouldn't peg it at 6%. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  So, maybe the two together growing slower than that, but the shift is to liquids with higher margins than the granular? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, that's right. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  That would be the way to look at it? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay, and then on this OxiClean Portable Stain Remover, is that different from the pen? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  It's the same kind of performance as the Tide to Go pen. It's different technology, they have a pen type application, ours is a spray type application. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Hasn't that been out awhile? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  It's been fully building distribution for about the last three to six months. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay. And then on this Unilever detergent business, is there any reason you would want to buy them just theoretically given what has happened with your buying their value toothpaste? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  No correlation at all. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  So there would be a potential that could stabilize those business, those brands or turn them around in your opinion? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  I don't think we can speculate on that. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research:  Okay, thank you. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, thank you. 
Operator:  You have a follow-up question from the line Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Hi guys, sorry to queue back in. Can we have some more color on the OxiClean, Arm & Hammer combination, when it ships, is that going to be compacted, kind of what the outlook is for it? And you said you had some pretty good feedback from the trade, can you just elaborate that a little bit? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Yes, Bill, it's started shipping in September. It's a compacted product, it's got outstanding cleaning performance, equal in whitening to the category leader. It will be a value price, but it is premium price per wash load or per ounce to our other Arm & Hammer brands. It will be line priced though to support line merchandising. But we will make premium margins and pricing off of it. So, it is just a really outstanding laundry detergent that leverages the stain fighting benefits of OxiClean, mixed with a great freshening and cleaning benefits of Arm & Hammer, we are really excited about it. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Okay, great, thanks so much. 
Operator:  You have a follow-up question from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please proceed. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Yes, just a quick follow-up on cash on the balance sheet, I mean, I guess, at what point do you have too much cash on the balance sheet and do you start putting it to use in terms of debt pay down or other things? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Yes, good question Bill. We have a almost $180 million of cash on the balance sheet. In my remarks I pointed out that we're 2.3 times levered total debt to EBITDA right now. So, we do on a regular basis evaluate what's the best use of cash. I mean, to-date it has been the pay down of debt. We did decide 90 days ago to stop paying down debt, primarily because of turbulence in the credit market. So we essentially built more of a warchest because as you know that we are focused on bolt-on acquisitions. You can't always predict when they are going to come, but we certainly are in a very good position to do OGI-size acquisition without accessing the credit markets. But that said, you can't predict when those going to happen. So it's a quarterly thing that we do. We evaluate what's the best use of our cash. There's no more I can say on that topic. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  And I guess following on that, are you seeing anything different on the acquisition landscape in terms of with the credit markets more things coming off, less things coming up for sale or is it pretty quiet? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer:  Well, we have a pretty active M&A program. As Jim pointed out, we are pretty fussy about the types of acquisitions that we will pursue, but as far as the number of properties that might be available, we are still seeing a pretty healthy inventory. But again, because of the criteria we set for ourselves that would narrow it down to a very small number of potential targets. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Okay, great. 
Operator:  Our final question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets Corp. Please Proceed. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Hi, I do have a follow up question on the compensation of the sales in Church & Dwight. I mean, over the last couple of years, you have gone to great pains to let us know that you have been pleased with the shift in the portfolio away from household products into personal care, even mentioning that if we were to look at it your sales split would now look pretty much like what P&G has. So with that as background, are there any reasons why we should think that you would alter that composition of sales within the portfolio with an acquisition in household products? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Well, Connie, this is Jim. I mean honestly, we did that when we bought OGI, which we paid $325 million for about $200 million business and it's just been incredibly successful acquisition. So we have always said we are agnostic when it comes to... as far as whether it's household or personal care businesses. When we see a great deal come along that we think would be very accretive for our company, we will make it. And we don't care whether it's an household or personal care. In the same hand, we are not going to make a deal that we think will hurt us, just because we want to enhance one side of the portfolio or the other. So like I said, our last one was household based, it's terrific. We are very happy with it and we will just look at what comes along the landscape and be patient. I do wish... I do think some people out there are making some crazy deals and overpaying. So we are going to be patient and wait for the market to come to us if it has to. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Corp:  Okay, thank you. 
Operator:  This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on today's conference call the Company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the Company's financial objective and forecast. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the Company's SEC filings.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Jim Craigie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Eric, and good morning to everyone. It is always a pleasure to talk to you, particularly when we have good results to report. I'll start off today by giving you a brief summary of the second quarter results. I'll then turn the call over to Matt Farrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Matt will provide you with the financial details of the second quarter. When Matt is finished, I'll provide some further information on the factors driving our key business units. Finally, I'll provide earnings guidance before we open the call to field questions from you.  Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were right in line with our expectations. Reported net sales were up 19% versus a year ago. Organic net sales which exclude the effect of acquisitions and foreign exchange were up a strong 5% versus a year ago. The organic net sales growth reflects solid gains in all three of our reported business units.  Gross margins were down 50 basis points versus the high year-ago base that was heavily impacted by lower than normal trade spending following significant price increases in April of 2006 on several household products. More importantly, gross margins were up 80 basis points versus the first quarter of this year in line with our plan, for gross margins to steadily improve every quarter of 2007.  Marketing spending was up 30 basis points versus a year ago, and up 320 basis points versus the first quarter to support the launch of new products. The combination of launching these new products, and increased marketing support led to record shares across many of our key brands. And finally, our earnings per share increased 9% to $0.59 per share, which was at the high end of our earnings guidance.  These solid results are right in line with our expectations and has set us up for what we expect will be another year of record sales, record profits and record earnings per share in 2007. I'll provide more detail in our business unit results in our outlook for the year in a few minutes.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt, which will provide with greater details on the financial results for the second quarter. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Okay, thanks, Jim. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the headlines. Our second quarter EPS was $0.59 per share as compared with $0.54 last year, a 9% increase. Our revenues are up 19% in which 5% was organic. Our gross margins improved 80 basis points, sequentially from the first quarter. In the first quarter you may remember we cited our expectations that we should have sequential improvement in gross margins throughout the year. And we'll say more about the year-over-year quarterly margin fluctuations in a moment.  Our marketing spend came in at 12.1% of revenues, up 30 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year quarter. And then with respect to taxes, our effective tax rate was higher than expected at 38% and I will also say more about that in a minute.  Now let’s review the income statement, beginning with sales. Second quarter sales were $547 million. The organic sales of 5% year-over-year growth was a result of broad based growth across all of our businesses. The domestic business had a strong quarter led by Arm & Hammer and Xtra Liquid Laundry Detergent and cat litter. Trojan, SpinBrush and Arm & Hammer Dental Care were also up year-over-year. However, offsetting the quarterly growth were declines in other toothpaste and antiperspirant.  The international business had a strong quarter led by Canada, Brazil and Australia. It's a combination of a couple of things. We've big new product introductions, specifically Arm & Hammer Enamel Care in the U.K., Nair new products in many markets, Lineance in France. And secondly, we had higher levels of marketing expenditures in international. We achieved some notable improvements in markets share. We have First Response now, the number one pregnancy kit in Canada, Nair share improvement in Canada, France, U.K. and Australia, and also Arm & Hammer Dental Care in the U.K.  Our other business, specialty products. The specialty products business also had a good quarter due to strong demand for our dairy products and higher volumes and pricing in the specialty chemicals business.  Year-over-year we had high slotting in the quarter, coincident with new product launches. Most of the slotting expense is behind us now as we enter the second half of the year. And regarding slotting, Q1, our previous quarter was the heaviest quarter for slotting due to new product launches. In comparing year-over-year organic growth in the quarter, it is important to remember that last year's price increases served to significantly strengthen the first quarter 2006 volumes while reducing Q2 2006 volumes particularly in liquid laundry. So, consequently we had an easier year-over-year comparison in Q2 than in Q1. The end result is that Q2 year-over-year organic sales were strong were 5%.  And now gross margins. 39-er gross margins, our second quarter gross margin was 39.7%, that’s lower by 60 basis points than last year, but 80 basis points higher than the first quarter of a year. The year-over-year gross margin was expected. Now remember when we raised prices last year effective April 1, 2006. At the same time, we reduced our trade spend in last year's second quarter, to help the new list take hold, and as a result, the highest quarterly gross margin in 2006 was the second quarter. The opposite happened this year in Q2, as we have more normalized trade spend now than last year. When compared to the first quarter of this year, we are pleased with the sequential improvement in gross margins. We continue to expect the second half gross margins to exceed first half margins. On a full year basis, although we have an evergreen target as you know of 125 basis points expansion, it will likely be lower due to compaction and the uncertainty of the commodity markets. We'll talk more about that later.  Marketing. Moving down to P&L now to marketing. Our marketing expense was about $12 million higher for the quarter, year-over-year, partially driven by the acquisition. Marketing expense as a percentage of sales was 12.1% in the quarter in contrast to 11.8% as a percentage of sales in the prior year second quarter. The dollar spend was just a couple of hundred thousand dollars just shy of our previous record spend in Q4 of 2006. Again, looking ahead, we expect Q3 marketing spend in both dollars and as a percentage of sales to exceed Q2 levels.  SG&A, the SG&A increased by about 10 million year-over-year which includes the impact of OGI as well as higher intangible asset amortization costs, higher brokerage fees and higher legal costs in this year's second quarter. Year-over-year SG&A as a percentage of sales declined from 13.9% last year to 13.5% this year.  Operating profits of $76.6 million, is up 15% over the prior year second quarter. The operating margin for the quarter is 14% compared to 14.5% in the prior quarter. But remember that the year-over-year comparison of operating margins is also influenced by the high gross margins in Q2 last year as well as the higher marketing expense this year as a percentage of sales.  Our other income expense increased primarily due to higher debt levels as a result of the OGI acquisition. There's really nothing more to say there.  Now income taxes. As you can see in the release, our effective rate for the quarter is 38.7% compared to 37.6% in 2006. This is explained by an additional $2.1 million valuation reserve that was recorded in the quarter for a tax asset at one of our foreign subsidiaries. And while I'm on the topic of tax, we are forecasting an effective rate of 36% for the balance of the year.  Free cash flow. With respect to free cash flow, we generated $32 million of free cash flow compared to $4 million in the year ago quarter. And CapEx in the second quarter this year was $14 million. Dividends were at 4.6.  Now, just looking at the balance sheet. Accounts receivable are up approximately $30 million versus the year ago, primarily due to our recent acquisitions, and also higher sales in the quarter. Inventories increased about $19 million versus a year ago, again due to the OGI acquisition. It's also noteworthy that we are in the process of transitioning the manufacturing of OGI products from co-packers to our plants and it’s going very well.  When you look at our debt levels, our first priority for free cash flow as you know is debt reduction. And our net debt at quarter end was $768 million. Our total debt to EBITDA per our bank agreement was approximately 2.5, putting us comfortably within our long-term target range of two to three times EBITDA.  So in conclusion, the short summary for the second quarter would be 5% organic growth, sequential quarterly gross margin expansion, higher marketing spend, new product activity and strong free cash flow.  Now back to you, Jim. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Matt. I'd like to provide everyone specific detail on each of our three key business units, our domestic business unit, our international business unit and our specialty products business unit, to give you a better sense of what is driving the company’s results. Please note that when I mention consumption I'm talking about all channel consumption, which includes the traditional food and drug channel as measured by Nielsen, plus our actual retail consumption results or actual sales results in other sales channels not measured by Nielsen, such as Wal-Mart, Dollar Stores and Plus [ph]. These non-measured channels are growing faster than the measured channels and they represent almost 40% of our company's total consumption and even greater than that of some of our brands. Thus what you see as Nielsen's share in consumption results is often a misleading indicator of the actual total consumption that occurs at some of our categories and brands.  Okay, let’s turn to talk about our domestic business unit. Total net sales in this business unit, grew 20% in the second quarter over the prior year period, driven largely by the impact of the Orange Glo acquisition. However organic net sales were also very strong driven by sales gains in the liquid laundry detergent, cat litter, baking soda, condoms, Arm & Hammer Toothpaste, SpinBrish and pregnancy kits. These sales gains were partially offset by declines in powdered laundry detergent, antiperspirant, value toothpaste and depilatories.  Overall we are very pleased with the organic growth of our domestic business unit driven by innovative new products, improved marketing programs, expanded distribution and improved merchandizing.  On the new product front, we are also beginning to see the benefit of a corporate new product team that was created in 2006 to deliver more innovative consumer products with strong consumer appeal. Last year, this group produced two great new products, the new Arm & Hammer FridgeFresh refrigerator deodorizer and the Arm & Hammer high performance cat littler, made from natural ingredients. These two great new products are continuing to experience strong sales gains in 2007. This year the new product team efforts have resulted in a record number of new product launches, 50 in total, including the following.  Arm & Hammer Essentials liquid laundry detergent which is formulated from plant-based surfactants and baking soda to deliver the same powerful cleaning capability as regular Arm & Hammer detergent. This new product has shown strong appeal among environmentally conscious consumers. We actually did a limited launch of this new product in 2006, and the consumer demand for this environmentally conscious product was so strong, that we’re now offering it nationally to all customers.  We've also expanded this time in the fabric softeners with the launch of Arm & Hammer Essentials Fabric Softener Sheet which is also off to a strong start. In fact, our new Arm & Hammer Essentials line of laundry products has done so well that we understand that Procter and Gamble will shortly launch a new version of Tide called Pure Essentials. We welcome the competition from industry leaders which will help to make even more consumers aware of the availability of these environmentally conscious products.  We've also just launched a highly, innovative Arm & Hammer cat litter called Odor Alert. This clumping cat litter contains crystals that change color when activated by the cat's urine, so the consumer can see and remove the soiled cat litter before they smell it. As our new commercial for this product states, "If your litter can’t change colors, change litters."  These new Arm & Hammer products have been supported by increase levels of marketing spending behind the new Arm & Hammer mega brand advertising campaign that we started in 2006. The net effect of these great new products, improved marketing programs and increased marketing spending is record sales and market shares in the second quarter on our Arm & Hammer laundry detergent, baking soda and cat litter businesses.  We’ve also launched innovative new products in our other core categories including Trojan condoms called Intense Ribbed, that has a deep ribs for intense pleasure. A new sub light of near depilatory product called Pretty which is specially formulated for the more sensitive skin of young girls in their teens and 20s. And three new SpinBrush toothbrushes, including a unique tooth clean version to enable both gum massage and brushing and our first rechargeable SpinBrush.  These new products have been supported by newer improved marketing campaigns that has driven record shares for our Trojan condom business and First Response pregnancy kit business.  The new SpinBrush products and marketing programs have also enabled us to achieve category leadership in battery powered toothbrushes. Our new product team has also significantly applied its skills to our latest acquisition by developing and launching a new OxiClean portable stain remover that instantly dissolves most stains. The portable instant stain remover segments is for consumers on the go and is a new and fast growing segment, and we expect the launch of this new product, under the popular OxiClean brand name will have strong consumer appeal. In fact the OxiClean brand achieved record shares in the first half of 2007 as a results of this new product, improved merchandizing and free distribution and continuous strong marketing support.  As mentioned earlier, the solid growth that we achieved in laundry detergent, cat litter, baking soda, condoms, Arm & Hammer toothbrush, toothpaste, SpinBrush, and pregnancy kits was partially offset by decline, particularly in our antiperspirant and value toothpaste businesses. These are sub categories once we faced exceptionally strong competitors with significant scale advantages. However, about six months ago, we created a new team of guerrilla marketers and a supporting cross-functional team to stem the decline in these categories. This team is too new to have any effect in the first half of 2007, since that timeframe was driven by customer decision made before the team was formed. We do expect to see improved results in these sub categories starting in the second half of 2007, as a result of the efforts of this new team.  Overall, we are very pleased with the sale, of the organic sales growth of our domestic business unit. Our efforts to launch innovative new products supported by more tactile marketing campaigns and increased spending is working. However, we are not satisfied and we expect to launch bigger new products at a faster rate in the future to meet up the demands of our consumers and to stay a step ahead of our competitors.  We also pushing our marketing team to develop more proactive and appealing marketing campaign. This is personified for the new Trojan campaign called Evolve, which was launched on June 18th on TV, print and our website. And we have seen a widespread news coverage and public relations support driven largely by the fact that the CBS and the Fox Networks have refused to run the commercial. Today this coverage has generated significant public dialogue on the importance of responsible sexual health. This supports our efforts to drive increased condom usage in the U.S., which has the worst sexual disease specific to any developed nation in the world. If you have not seen our new Trojan Evolve commercial, and wish to do so, you can see it on our website www.trojanevolve.com.  Finally, I want to mention that Church & Dwight will fully support the industry wide initiative to reduce the water content of liquid laundry detergent by moving to concentrated offering. We will begin rolling out concentrated line of sensible Arm & Hammer and Xtra to resellers this September and complete the national launch to all resellers in mid 2008. This initiative will help to recover the unfavorable cost impact of higher oil prices by reducing the cost of the detergent, the packaging and its shipping costs. While the launch impact of this action is expected to help recover the gross margin hit in our liquid laundry brand from the significant commodity increases that occurred in 2005 and 2006, we expect to improve short terms conversions costs of this effort in 2007 and the first half of 2008.  Now let me talk for a minute about other two business unit, our international business unit and our specialty product division. Our international business unit which represents about 16% of our total sales had an excellent second quarter with a 20% increase in total sales over the prior year. This increase was driven by strong results in Canada, Australia, Mexico and Brazil. Notably, we achieved market share leadership on First Response for the first time in Canada. We’ve also launched the Trojan brand in China through a wholly owned subsidiary and distribution is growing in key accounts and pharmacy. The improved organic growth and market expansions in international business unit reflects improved coordination between all functions in our domestic international unit to leverage new product innovation, improved marketing campaigns and supply chain best practices.  In our specialty product business unit which represents about 11% of total company sales, net sales drew a healthier 11% over last year’s second quarter. This excellent growth was driven largely by strong demand by dairy farmers for animal nutrition product despite recent price increases. Our specialty chemicals business also benefited from the increased sales despite price increases that were necessary to recover higher raw material energy costs. Sales of our products particularly increased in Brazil driven by the strong Brazilian economy.  Let me switch gears now and talk about the future. Well we are pleased for the solid second quarter results, we are never satisfied. First, in terms of dealing with issues, we have enabled to absorb unprecedented level of cost increases for raw materials, packaging and transportation since 2004 and still delivered solid growth margin improvement and earnings growth. We have a well organized pipeline cost saving initiatives in the areas of manufacturing, purchasing and distribution that are being executed and along with the price increases taken in 2005, 2006 and 2007 have enabled us to more than offset the higher commodity costs.  The improvement in our gross margin has enabled us to increase marketing spending. This increased marketing spending has been focused behind a strong pipeline and new product innovation in every one of our core categories supported by improved marketing campaign. As I stated earlier these new products, improved marketing campaigns and increased spending have resulted in record sales and shares for the second quarter in many of our key category such as liquid laundry detergent, cat litter, baking soda, condoms and pregnancy kits. We are very pleased with these results, but we know that we must continue to improve in our core categories and stem the declines in categories where we are weak.  We will also continue to drive growth in our international market by leveraging our new market and the marketing programs into all applicable worldwide markets, while at the same time, improving the efficiency of our worldwide supply chain through implementation of best practices. Now let me translate this into a specific guidance for the rest of this year.  In view of our solid organic results in the second quarter, our confidence in new product launches and improvement in gross margins we remain enthusiastic about 2007. However since commodity cost remain unstable this time, we are going to reaffirm our earnings per share forecast for the year of $2.34 and $2.36 which is equivalent to 13% to 14% increase over 2006 results. This will include the expected negative impact of conversion cost related to the transition to concentrated liquid laundry detergent starting in late 2007.  Organic sales growth is expected to stay strong in the back half of 2007 behind a significant increase in marketing spending to support our new product launches and several new advertising campaigns. There will also be one major new product launch in the fourth quarter. For competitive reasons, I'll not divulge the details behind this launch at this time.  The continued solid organic revenue growth in the back half of 2007 will support our targeted organic revenue goal range of 3% to 4% for the total year. This excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the acquisition of the Orange Glo business. We also expect gross margins to be higher in the back half of the year and the first half. In addition we expect second half earnings to be more evenly distributed in the third and fourth quarters than in prior years.  In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first half present results and we feel confident we can deliver our earnings per share forecast for the year barring any significant changes and commodity cost for competitive action.  That ends our presentation. I’ll now open the call for any questions you may have which Matt and I will do our best to answer. I do want to mention though that due to travel commitments Matt and I are in different locations today, so we may have to cause some audibles in the phone as we decide who'll take the lead in answering your questions. Operator, please go ahead.  Question and Answer 
Operator: [Operator Instructions].  Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank, please proceed. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Bill. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Hey, how was pricing holding up, I know, a lot of the compaction stuff is already out there, I mean, a lot of people are afraid that a lot of it may get dealt back and I was wondering what your initial thoughts on that were? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Bill, pricing is holding up exceptionally well. No issues there. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And why is Wal-Mart launching private label again in the face of the compaction theme? It seems like it’s a pretty disingenuous strategy by them? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don’t know what you are talking about. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Yes you do. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, private label what, Bill? 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Its private label detergent, was it Simply Elegant or something that’s a some Huish variant that’s going to be under Sun that’s kind of like a knock off of the Tide variant? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well I mean it's under the Sun brand, so that’s going on a long time, so it's probably just a new variant like everybody else tries. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay, got you. And then how is the OxiClean migration going from their factories to yours, I know you started, talked about starting last quarter. I'm just curious, how that’s progressing? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's been excellent. We will complete the transition from the co-packers into our factories in the second half of this year. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. And then just on gross margin at the back half of the year. Have you thought about taking another price increase or is there anybody in the industry thought about another price increase given the big spike up in resin and surfactants that seem to follow apparently? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Bill, this is Matt. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Yes. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: We haven’t signaled any changes with respect to pricing in the second half. What we are counting on in the second half with respect to margins is that a few things, slotting is going to be behind us now, because it's pretty much concentrated in the first couple of quarters. Second thing is OGI plant integration, we get some synergies from that in the back half. We are obviously going to get some better distribution on some of the new products that we just launched. So that will keep expanding and then I guess finally we have our ongoing cost reduction programs in the company, reformulation, improving yields et cetera. So we feel pretty good about gross margins expanding in the second half without a price increase. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great, thank you very much. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey: Good morning. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Bill. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey: I guess, just talk a little bit more about compaction. I mean, it sounds like you now are seeing a little greater cost in the back half in the next year than you originally anticipated. Can you give us a little more color around that? Are you now also looking at more marketing and advertising? I know P&G is doing a lot to educate the market, are you being pulled in to do that as well? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, Bill, what's going on is we are clearly following the lead of the industry leader here on compaction. It's just as we get closer and closer to the start date it's getting a little clearer as to what the transition costs are being on both our plants and with retailers. So it's just that real vision. We are not participating in any industry efforts to advertise this issue. We will do our own stuff, everybody else to our knowledge are doing their own stuff. So everything seems on track so far for this effort. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey: And I guess I am just trying to understand kind of the additional cost that maybe you hadn’t seen before is that just sharing more the cost with the retailers as you do the roll out or is it just cost of transitioning the plants is maybe greater than you originally expected? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's just pretty much… it's just pretty much what we thought and expected, we hadn't talked much about before but it is transitioning our plants to manufacturing those smaller bottles. Any impact it might have on logistics and also potentially working with retailers to reset all the shelves. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey: I guess you had said in the past I mean, you sought to see some benefits from this program by the fourth quarter. Is that probably early, is it maybe more mid next year? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's more mid next year. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey: And then I guess… finally do you see in other areas beyond detergent, do you see other needs for price increases? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Not at this time, Bill. We have taken some pretty aggressive price increases in our specialty product division this year to keep up with raw material and energy costs. Right now given where commodity prices are, we don’t see the need for anything. Probably because we are being so aggressive and good in our own cost structure of cutting back on cost, we don’t have anything planned at this point in time. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey: Okay. And then just one last one. Can you just remind us fixed versus floating kind of what the capital structure looks like and if there are any changes planned? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: No we haven't signaled any changes in our capital structure. Just in round numbers, we have $100 million convert that’s out there, we have another couple of $100 million of high yield and then we have $400 million roughly of bank debt. And then we have another $100 million in securitized receivables. So by the way we are going to file our Q today, so you will get all the details this afternoon. 
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey: Perfect, thanks. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Bill. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with CIBC World Markets. Please proceed. 
Joe Altobello - CIBC World Markets: Hey guys good morning. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Joe. 
Joe Altobello - CIBC World Markets: Just want to go back on the gross margin issue for a second. Was compaction cost or the higher compaction cost the lion's share of the change from the 125 bips or is it more the commodity cost inflation we have seen over in the last couple of months? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, but we have got uncertainty with respect to both of those items right. So compaction, it's an obvious one that was already covered by Jim. With respect to commodities I am sure you know we are exposed to a number of different commodities, resin would be one, corrugated liner board, diesel, even vegetable oils that affects… alcohol is the first surfactant that go into our detergent. So you know that still there is a lot of volatility right there, so consequently we would say that it's probably unlikely we are going to hit a 125 basis points this year.  But you also know we don’t call line items on the P&L. The only thing we give guidance on specifically is EPS which is at $2.34 to $2.36. And we have our evergreen target of the company of 3%-4% top line, 125 basis points of gross margin expansion. But given compaction of where commodities are, it's unlikely we are going to get to that this year, because you also know that as we improve our gross profits, we file it back in to the marketing line. So you can see marketing go up year after year here. 
Joe Altobello - CIBC World Markets: Okay. And then in terms of the quarterly impacts and the higher compaction costs, is there one quarter which stands out in the next say three or four that would be hit the most? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: It's kind of hard to say because you have three waves that are coming. 
Joe Altobello - CIBC World Markets: Right. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: You have got September, April 1 January and April 1. So I think each one could bring its own factors that we are going to have to deal with. So no, it would be hard to predict that right now, Joe. 
Joe Altobello - CIBC World Markets: Okay. And then lastly, on the acquisition side it sounds like your balance sheet is pretty much or actually pretty strong here. Are you guys looking for acquisitions actively and would you prefer a personal care or household business? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Joe, we are already looking. We are very honestly ambivalent between household and personal care, because we have business on both sides, plants on both sides and everything. And other than that we just don’t comment about any activity in that front. 
Joe Altobello - CIBC World Markets: Okay thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Please proceed. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Good morning. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Alice. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Hi, how much were your newly acquired brands up, year-over-year, apples to apples comparison of OxiClean and Kaboom, I guess? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I didn’t follow the question, Alice. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: How much were their sales up at… I guess the way to put it would be at retail, your newly acquired brands, are they growing? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Oh the OxiClean business, yes they are growing. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: And can you give us some numbers and tell us are they all retailers end or what--? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No we don’t give numbers on specific businesses, but they were up nicely. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Were they ahead of your expectations? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: They were very much in line with our expectations. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: All right. And could you give us some sense of how much Trojan might have been up at retail? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, Alice, we never comment on specific product lines. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: All right. Another effort would be, we are understanding that Unilever might be getting rid of its US detergents, is that something that you could do or would what to do? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We don’t comment on M&A actions. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Would there be any antitrust problems in your buying of brands? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We don’t comment on M&A actions. 
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: All right, I'll give up, thanks a lot. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with A.G. Edwards. Please proceed. 
Jason Gere - A.G. Edwards: Thanks, good morning. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey. 
Jason Gere - A.G. Edwards: Hey, a couple of questions. One can you just give a little more color on some of the positive learning so far with the new structure for the value toothpaste and the deodorants. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The special team we put on it? 
Jason Gere - A.G. Edwards: Yes, maybe just anecdotally share some of the things that you have learnt over maybe the course of the three months you have announced the team there. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: A little bit, Jason. We call it guerrilla marketing and it's a fairly common term in the industry. It's just doing much more micro marketing I would call it on an account-by-account basis to do what you need to do in the key accounts that carry the product. We're making sure we have the right pack sizes, the right fragrances on the antiperspirant line. We are doing smart, efficient things in every account to support the business. And with the new team we've put in place, we've brought that much more micro focus I would call it to these businesses and it's really doing a much better job of maintaining distribution and in some cases growing distribution and then also in driving in-store consumption of the brand.  So, we didn’t invent this. This has been used in a lot of the big companies, but we're applying it with great finesse I think to these brands. And I think you will see the benefit of that starting in the second half of this year, as I said earlier. 
Jason Gere - A.G. Edwards: Is it too early to ask about maybe shelf space of some of these brands which probably whether or not you are getting any increased space with them? What’s been the reaction I guess of your major retailers with your efforts at this point? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first job is to, hold the space in these categories and the team’s doing a very good job of that. In a few cases they have gone in and gotten some incremental distribution. I think the retailers are generally much happier that we are paying this kind of special attention to these brands with a team that’s very focused on issues such as distribution and in-store promotions and in-store advertising and stuff like that. 
Jason Gere - A.G. Edwards: Okay. And then just the second question, I guess, going back to gross margins. Is it fair to assume that margins in the back half of the year will be around or maybe even a little bit lower than your… I guess your long-term guidance of 125? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Sorry, Jason, yes year-over-year it’s going to be difficult to get to a 125 basis points expansion. What I have said earlier is that the second half gross margins, ’07 will be higher than the first half of ’07. 
Jason Gere - A.G. Edwards: Right. But the increase will still be below, I guess, your longer term guidance? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it will be. 
Jason Gere - A.G. Edwards: Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Matt. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Connie. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: I don’t know if… I haven’t seen the press release, so I am sorry if this information is in there. But could you give the organic growth rate for the domestic business? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, we didn’t, we just gave for the overall company, but I would say, domestically it was in the mid-single digits, on the domestic. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Also on the value toothpaste, we are hearing from P&G that they believe they are becoming the category leader overall in oral care. And that as such there will be a less and less space for minor brands, some of which are in your portfolio. Is this possible that you would just discontinue some of the smaller brands that have been under pressure for so much time? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Never. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Never? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: So is the strategy in the guerrilla marketing just to find places, channels of distribution where the biggest names aren't controlling quite as much shelf space? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Our intention is just to educate the retailers that some of our SKUs have a faster retail movement on them than some of the 50,000 versions of Crest and Colgate. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Do you foresee a time when your share will stabilize or grow? 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Our share has already stabilized, it is improving on Arm & Hammer toothpaste and it's actually doing well on some of the minor brands. So just like Procter's usual proclamations of greatness, we'll be very… we'll be doing just fine in the toothpaste category. 
Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks so much. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Just had a quick follow-up. What was the gross to net sort of this year and what was it year ago? And can just… I know you can't give me exact numbers, but it was up like an order of magnitude and can you just sort of say how much that really impacted to the gross margin line? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Bill, as you know, we don’t call out what the gross percentage or even what the gross dollars are on an annual basis, but I mean suffice to say that we spend $100 million plus on a quarterly basis on trade. So, as you can see just a few million dollars can be a pretty large basis point difference in gross margins. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Right. I guess and you call it out in the press that there was sort of higher trade funding this quarter and that’s what impacted the gross margin? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Exactly. Right, so if you got a $100 million of trade spend and you spend 3% more that’s going to affect your gross margin by 60 basis points. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Got you. Okay. 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: So that, it’s a big lever. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Right. Is that mostly slotting or is that other stuff as well? 
Matthew T. Farrell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: No, it's trade spend. 
William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. All right. Thanks for taking my follow-up. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill. 
James R. Craigie - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Any other questions? All right. Again, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, very happy with the first half results. The business is on a roll and we see continued improvement rolling into the second half of the year. I want to thank you all for taking the time today to talk to us and if you have any follow-up questions, please give me or Matt a call. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a good day.
